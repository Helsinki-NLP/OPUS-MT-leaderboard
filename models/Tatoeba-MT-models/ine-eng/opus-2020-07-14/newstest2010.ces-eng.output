Barack Obama gets a fourth American president of the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will fly to Norway's Oslo for 26 hours to take over the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth American President in history.
Diploma, medals and check for 1.4 million dollars, among other things, will be an exceptional effort to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The Chief of the White House will fly to the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with Michelle's wife and will have plenty.
First, he is invited to the Nobel Institute, where he first meets with five members of the committee who elected him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The President's couple then have a planned meeting with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonjou.
In the afternoon, the visit will be held by a ceremony of celebration, to which Obama will be awarded a prestigious award.
He gets it as the fourth U.S. president, but only the third one who gets the price right in the office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will speak of the Afghan War when he receives his credit.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that the price is being taken over as a president who is currently fighting in two countries.
The military effort a few days ago increased by sending another unit to Afghanistan, which will not forget to highlight any of its criticisms.
Obama also receives gold medals, diplomas, and checks on ten million Swedish crowns (as many as 24 million Czech crowns).
You're going to give for charity, but he hasn't decided on a specific charter yet.
The award will then be made by the President of the Bank, with the exception of the Norwegian King and the Queen, as well as the Prime Minister and other 250 guests invited.
Obama made himself more restrained from beginning to end.
For example, he stated that he felt that he did not deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not just a price for him, but for everyone who strives for the same values as he does.
Once after the announcement, he said it was "a call for action".
Protection of nature accused of extermination
The Lithuanian police accused the president of the Civil Society of the Lithuanian Nature Protection Society of the exorbitant.
In a number of cases last year, he appealed to some building management, demanding that the investors pay for his benefit, said Lithuanian police spokesman Alena Romová.
The President of the Lithuanian Society of Nature Protectors is Lubomir Studnička.
Now he's in prison and he's been threatening him for up to three years.
Brno class containers are too low
In Prague, ordinary people can categorize packages from drinks, you will meet the class containers again at any step in the South Moravian villages.
And in Brno?
There to win a few minutes before you can find a suitable match.
I don't want to say that he wouldn't even manage the waste in Brno.
But it turns out that we are the second largest city in the Republic, the council is not interested in this problem.
Brno is not only in the washbasin of the waste classification, but also as citizens here we can still throw only paper, glass and plastics into the sorting containers, but above all the number of garbage for such waste.
Have you ever tried at the center, for example, to throw PET sheets into the collecting basket?
It's a good piece of cake, mostly it wants time and nerves.
The only place I've ever met is in Moravian Square opposite Potrefene Husse.
Don't let Mr. Onderk and my colleagues get mad at me, but I don't think that's gonna happen.
Do not mention that there is no honey in other parts of the waste classification.
A number of my friends don't like waste like that.
I'm on my way.
That's what they've got to do.
I don't admire them.
I offered myself to throw out a couple of glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colour ashtrays on Kounnick's street.
Luckily, I went to the right place on my way to the country.
However, the waste ran out of it.
It's still the center of Brno, which probably represents the city most, no?!
But ecology and some aesthetics of bronian socialists don't care much.
These cities prefer to buy a hockey extralige that will make us ashamed of the entire Republic before they buy a few containers and offer to classify other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to confirm with official statistics after a moment of browsing the Internet.
According to ECO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole of the country of South Moravia.
"Paroubkov" budget took money on pensions and indiscriminate
After the left has added despite the opinion of the government to farmers or officials, it must not be in the budget of the money on the income, the hospital or the construction site.
But also for government debt interest or international court disputes.
It will create problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Edward Janota.
When social democrats and communists were prosecuting some groups, they thought that the government would also borrow on sensitive expenditure, income or indiscriminately. "It is only a delay in the problems of the future, the attachment of mins," Janota says.
The higher the interest is paid from the borrowed money, and it has to come back sometimes.
There's no state to choose where to take it.
If it does not reduce social benefits or costs at the state level, it must raise taxes.
All that the left hand hath she added unto the firemen, to the teachers, and to the husbandmen.
And later on to their children.
About the income or the infirmary, whose account has disappeared 1.8 billion, people don't have to worry about getting them.
However, in view of the fact that the state is more in debt, the next year will not be less than 163 billion dollars in cash, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, I will continue to grow as quickly as possible and with him and the cost of interest.
The State will need money to pay for it and will no longer be able to properly increase VAT or reduce the maternal rate, as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
Because of the money transfers in favour of several groups of voters, the next year will also miss five billion to the supply of railways and railways.
It is mainly about already complicated and disassembled sections that are not redesigned and, where appropriate, redesigned.
Most of all, it's not free, either.
It means delaying or halting thirty large buildings, also threatening to spend European money, warns the transport ministry's spokesman Karel Hanzelk.
ČSSD has proposed that the loss of the money will resolve the shamamonunski – it will fall to the dividend of ČEZ, which is mostly owned and from which the transport fund will join.
The problem is that the dividend rate is never certain, and it is no longer an inundated source.
Last year, it came from the CEZ to the budget of 18 billion.
Every year, the dividend is paid out of the disposal of environmental damage, supplemented by a pension account or serves as a reserve for a future pension reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the actual budget deficit by 5.7 per cent of GDP.
However, the carnival does not end the movement.
Nearly three billion were spent in the budget for the various compensation of the victims of communism and crime or for the costs of judicial disputes, even for construction.
If without this money, it's not safe.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we'll have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, settle on the government budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing from the already planned two billion-dollar State Treasury project, which is intended to allow online monitoring of what individual offices are losing.
The first stage is starting in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped, the penalty would come, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will manage two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone on which the user will press the single button to switch between different operating systems.
The plans revealed seem to be a promise.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile you will be transferred to Android within seconds.
This is precisely the option of the American VMware company, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to run two user profiles at once.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into household and work.
Both will work in one and at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in a computerworld magazine interview.
He was presented in November last year and was first introduced several days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced a smartphone test sample to journalists with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800 with RAM memory of 128 MB size, on which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems were running at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full supply.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test the virtualisation of smartphones and devices should be delivered to customers during 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains suffering from hotels
The big cops don't just worry about the gecko's tractors.
The missing snow also reflects people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, free rooms are still available for all wintertimes, including Christmas and Silvestra, in the Giant Mountains.
We've got a lot of visitors on our pages.
People go through offers, find prices, but so far they're afraid to order.
And if they call us, they'll be wondering if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or on mud," said the information portal operator Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants a Silvestrov's stay in Špindler's Mlýn according to his own ideas should no longer weigh an order.
Whoever gives preference to the money and the quality of the accommodation is with him to the second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
Spindler hotelers are currently offering most of their weekly stays on Silvestra.
I think they'll try to drown for a while, but then they'll let and go for a short time.
And then the free rooms will die quickly," said Jandura.
The free bed in all winter terms is still offered by the Ingtours travel office.
Now we're most interested in a Christmas week that hasn't been sold yet.
That's how half of the place in our offer remains free.
That is why we have already found some cheaper holiday stays for the last time," Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert said.
Silvestra in the Giant Mountains can offer the top travel office even more, but less free places are available.
It's good for the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter terms are being sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If they're snowed during the week, they'll sell Christmas," my Schiefert.
On the contrary, the rooms of the Hotel Horizont in Peci, under Snow, can be accommodated.
We're about five percent better at that.
We have the last few seats at Silvestra and Christmas.
There is a great interest in Polish holidays in January and it is also well sold yesterday," the director of the best bakery hotel Karel Rada informed.
Eighty percent of the hotel has Silvestrov's residences and the hotel Omnia at the central parking lot in Janský Lázní.
On the contrary, at Christmas, there are still half of the beds available at the latest Janskolasen hotel.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by the ice that we already have, at this point, about 60 percent.
It's a little weaker so far, but once snow strikes, the interest in staying in the Giant Mountains will certainly rise, the hotel director Omnia Erik Sporysch has introduced.
However, in a larger snowy season, the hotel has to let go of taste.
It's supposed to cool on Thursday, if there's any hits, there should be snow on the mountains.
But then again, Jiří Jakubský informed the Czech hydrometeorological institution from the city center.
USA: Repeating is a mother of wisdom
He's just a comic, with what school effort Barack Obama, the president with the most clever history, repeats in the Afghan question his predecessor's strategy, which he himself considered to be the stupidest.
Finally, when he poured out his eagerly anticipated Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had picked it up over a copy of Bush's Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only does he repeatedly use the word "as in Iraq" in his own text, but he does not even dare to use the name Bush's January 2007 declaration as the name of his own declaration: "New road forward".
However, he himself criticised Bush's idea of sending fresh military forces to Iraq with a narrow civil war as "incompatible and in its aftermath disastrous decisions".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy based on the recommendations of full-fledged leaders was the only possible and most successful way to avoid talking today about Iraq in the reporting reports.
Bush did not improve his reputation, but he objectively left his successor a much more grateful background than it could have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will return.
He was once again asked by the full-fledged commanders, in particular the Chief Executive Officer of the Afghan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his subordinary habit, severely criticized the heavy-duty shooters in the White House.
He asked for 40,000 men to break the situation for a better one.
The president's been waving for three months, but he didn't do anything better, so at least he drove the general about 10,000 soldiers.
He has been able to demand more than five thousand from Europe, even if he has originally counted at least 10 of them.
The most problematic of Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to start downloading troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and end this process in three years. Obama's entire doctrine raises more questions than he provides answers.
Many doubt that half an increase gives the same fruit as the one in Iraq.
Even in recent years, the Iraqi society has been relatively well organized, and its leaders respect the agreement.
The Afghan situation is marked by a different sign - no one can be relied on and no agreements are respected.
The Afghan security forces that are used every day to change the gentleman according to how they feel about them are being misappropriated under these conditions.
Political institutions, even though they are formally founded, will remain only a settlement of the homeland that will continue to flourish in patriarchal tribal relations.
The exportation of interests of different ethnic groups is unusually complicated due to the lack of transparency of the conditions that make Pakistan and Iran more complicated.
Nor is the construction of "a state of action", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, it doesn't seem too real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is invading its volunteerism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of an explosion.
To believe that soldiers sending to a war cry for the purpose of "fast return home" causes a miracle here, it can only be a truly romantic, reality unbounded.
From a political point of view, the date of the arrival of the army is a clear failure, as the Taliban will take this as an indirect recognition of the US defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in war operations in Afghanistan is heading towards a decline.
European politicians do not have and do not want to explain to their wishes how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu sub-region.
Another factor that is capable of radically affecting the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions on Iran are not affected, the issue of overload will arise before the United States, if not trying to resolve the military problem.
It will have to be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America moves towards a winning landing from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will also mean a dramatic turnout in the Afghan situation.
The only obstacle to Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years remaining in the presidential elections, and therefore there is still enough time left to come up with another strategy if this appears to be a total failure.
Bank managers Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash rewards
The senior executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash in this year's reward.
It announced the company that reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 front managers will get money instead of a stock that will be available for sale within five years.
The shares may also be taken by managers if they are to be over-risked.
Goldman Sachs thus, according to the Reuters agency, puts himself at the forefront of the Wall Street reward connection with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to be issued, the former investment banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott introduced.
The problem is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank became a critic after the first three-quarters of this year's loan of nearly $17 billion (approximately 300 billion CZK) for the rewards.
According to the Agency Reuters, the total remuneration in the company for this year is likely to exceed 20 billion dollars in spite of the measure announced today.
High wages in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in many countries with the coming financial crisis.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that the bank's bonuses of over 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK) are intended to impose a flat-rate tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are being made by France.
This year women won Nobel Prize in all races except physics
The record of five women today in Stockholm took over from the hand of Swedish King Carl XVI. Gustafa this year's Nobel Prize in professional and literature.
In addition to four scholars, there was also a German writer of Romanian origin Hert Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded by two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their countryman Jack Szostak, for research in the field of chromosomes.
The price for chemistry was received by Israeli Ada Jonathan along with American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz to explain the structure and function of the fish.
The final prize was Nobel Prize for the economy won by American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson for economic management analysis.
The only professional category that came around this year without a holder was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Aso have taken this prize for research on optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyl for finding a CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical remote views.
Each rated took over diplomas, Nobel medals and financial reward certificates.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category (about 25 million CZK).
If there are more than one of them, they share the reward.
Traditionally the most unexpected Nobel Peace Prize has already been received by Norwegian President Barack Obama this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his assessment, for it is only at the beginning of his path and he stands in the forefront of the country that is leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defending his policy, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary for peace-keeping, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota's considering the demos.
President Václav Klaus will accept, on Friday morning, Finance Minister Eduardo Janota, who is considering government collapse, because he disagrees with the image of the state budget for the next year, as the Ambassador of Sweden approved it on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps Janot's break-in in the cabinet will be the subject of their Friday meetings.
The budget also criticises Klaus.
According to him, he has too high a deficit, which further exacerbates the public finances crisis.
The meeting was briefed by the president's spokesman Radim Ochtat.
Janota wants to deal with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which will now get Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should host 163 billion crowns.
However, on Wednesday, the Commission approved the proposals on the left to move the money and raised the money to the salaries of civil servants, to the operation of social services and to direct payments to farmers.
The government has put forward a proposal for social democracy by secretly visiting the budget.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a sharp intropolitic dispute, which started to raise a question about the further operation of Fischer's office, whose formation in the spring had been agreed by the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was adopted by the House, essentially eliminates the package of savings measures that Fischer's government has in the autumn and that it is intended to stop the state's debt.
Klaus, who can but must not sign the state budget law, said on this morning's discussion with the entrepreneur that politicians have for a long time neglected the "serious problem", which is "an unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He doesn't have a good solution today.
The improvement could only bring a strong government that could also build on the broader consensus of the political parties, my President.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek stated that the budget is scary and the government should consider other existences.
ODS Vice-President Petr said that the concept of an official office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the green ones is no longer clearly working.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer identified similar words as "strong years".
Chief of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek at Topolánka responded to the statement that a terrible budget was the budget which the former topolan government prepared for this year and which exceeds 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD marked the approval of the state budget for the next year for success.
They were men of peace, too.
Mandel in Clint Eastwood's newspaper played Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: Unbeatable will tell the world a lot about the country, about its fight and its victories despite some critics that the main roles are made by American players.
The story tells about sports, racial conditions and Nelson Mandel.
An unconstitutional fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in the South African Republic and its first black President Nelson Mandel in his life story is an Oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that one-ninety-year-old Mandela asked him if he could make him in Eastwood's movie.
Another important role in it is Matt Damon.
I said to him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
For example, a two-and-a-half-year-old actor who won the role in Eastwood's drama from the millions of dollars of Baby's box has already created a leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he eventually became a child, a fictional president of the United States and even a god in God's Evan, but only rarely anyone who lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for his active work to end the apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released for freedom in 1990 and then for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded.
Invictus is a Latin word for the unfavorable and is the name of former English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The picture is a true story of Nelson Mandela joining forces with the captain of the South African football team Francois Pinaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation is still racially and economically divided after the apartheid.
They believe that they can connect their people through sports, so it is up to them to unite the players of the race, who are in a worldwide dimension between the outsiders.
The South African team will finally move to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandel's story on the plate.
I had no other purpose than to play this role so that I could bring it as close as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
Herec said that if he and the world politics were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, dinner with him, be in the background before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted Mandel to shake his hand.
I found out that when I print your hand, I take over your energy, it transmits, and I felt like I knew how you felt, said.
It's important for me to try to be with another person.
Matt Damon is making a film in Françoise Pienaara, a captain of the national football team, where white players were playing.
Herec said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough world of rags.
A big surprise for him was when he first met Pionara in his home.
I remember when I rang the home bell, he opened up to me, and the first thing I told François Pinaar in my life was, "I look a lot bigger in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences in players' figures compared to their actual submissions led by the director of Eastwood, Invictus received: Unfavored positive reviews and they are also about the ambitions of Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety Todd McCarthy cut his assessment into words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of the lightning over Norway dissolved: Russians tested the rocket
Over Norway, it was possible to observe the special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defence just yesterday admitted that near the Norwegian borders were testing an intercontinental ballistic missile.
However, the start was again unsuccessful and shot marked as "Bulva" type, which was originally to be the crumb of the Russian army, slowly becoming the black wall of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Neither his repeated presence in the rocket tests had a related effect on the success of the pilot years.
Most of the storm didn't even come up or get hurt in the air.
In Russian newspapers, "Bulve" is already written as "a rocket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights
The 13th attempt was made at the beginning normally.
By the end of the flight, there was a technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently, the engine exploded in a third-degree rocket.
This time "Bulva" started from the nuclear furnace Dmitrij Donski, which floated under the cold of the White Sea.
This type of rocket enables the launch of a vessel that is in motion and at the same time humiliated.
That's why it's likely that the mysterious light on Norway caused by a nearby undetermined flying object was actually damaged "Bulva".
The rest of the Norwegians have not doubted the fact that it is a Russian missile since the first time.
Generals are defending themselves this time, and they say they can't talk clearly about failure.
The first two degrees of rockets were sustained and the accident reached the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged immediately to the first degree.
Even though no attempt has been made without a mistake, only six out of thirteen of them have failed to manage the defence ministry.
Nearly 50 percent of the success of the generals therefore fills with optimism and still claims that "Bulva" will fly once again without problems and that it will even take up to ten hypersonal nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1,15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed a 51-year contract in CSK Moscow
The legendary defender of Vjačeslav Fetisov is again presented in a professional hockey game in 51 years.
The former world champion, the Olympic winner and holder of Stanley Cup will help in the need of his team CSK Moscow and will probably come already in the Friday duel of KHL against Petrohrad.
Fetisov, who completed his career in the '40s in 1998, is currently President of the Cska.
After Denis Kuljas has been injured, we need another protector.
Fetisov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
We just need to resolve some formal concerns, quoted by the agency AP of the Moscow Club Sergei Germany.
It's not clear yet whether comeback of a famous hockey player will only be involved in one match.
I think Fatisov is one of those who can revive the spirit of other players, he introduced Germans.
Fetisov thus, according to the AP, in the case of a return to ice, becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, he won the whole season for Hartford's legendary attacker Gordie Howe and enrolled 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold, seven titles of the world master, triumphed in Canada Cup and a junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he was also successful in NHL, where in Detroit's dress he took over Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the hockey Sino of fame.
Hyundai told the board he'd cancel all overtime.
The management of Hyundai's car with the committees agreed to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the frequent schedules that the committees announced on Monday's event preparedness.
He confirmed it to Hyundai Petr Vaněk.
However, the management wants to agree with the board on another Saturday shift.
We cannot rely on our production plan, which is essential, so a voluntary average was proposed on Saturday, December 19th, by making two changes, Vaněk said.
Server Sedmiška.cz wrote that the company of employees who are working on the Saturday shift offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
They'll get people back on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way employees are motivated by the proposed overtime.
Whether they let themselves be paid a supplement in advance or they can choose the replacement on December 28th, and this will be the day of the extension of the Christmas celebration, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees will receive paid travel and lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and most flammable point in terms of comments and complaints made by the experts, and by protesting employees, who had stopped the production alive last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with the immediate validity of the cancellation of all overtime on December, Vaněk said.
By last week, car employees were forced virtually every day after the eight-hour shift to work out another two-hour overtime.
Following the signing of the agreement, the Committee shall revoke the delegation of power
Further negotiations between car management and the experts are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
The Head of the Committees Petr Cooker said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the post.
The situation in the car arose last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees were spontaneously arrested due to unsatisfied weather.
They also protested against the wrong payment conditions and alleged fraud.
The Authority reiterated that in the meantime, employees must work to meet the requirements for the delivery of cars.
The Committee also requested that no sanctions be imposed on employees who interrupted the production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the board of directors requires that it reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay $5,000 for it this year.
Hyundai's car now employs 2,000 people.
The production of the series was carried out last November.
By September, it produced about 80,000 cars, and its current production capacity is 200,000 cars a year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that also carries on 'infectious' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main benefit of improved substances is that it also takes on the viruses that have already been obtained against immunosuppressive drugs.
This fact in some cases is preferable to the fact that the compound on the common variant of the virus does not work as strongly as some of the medicines already available.
Not able to cure AIDS so far.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life-long life of a combination of medicines that prevent the reproduction of HIV virus in the body.
However, their use is associated with a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete suppression of the virus is due to the development of so-called resistant viruses against which medicines are no longer effective.
The work of experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
It has been shown that the substances called metallic carborene affect the protein responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metal carbs are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus other than all medicines used today, and therefore they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come with new ‘improvement’ compounds prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
Metal carborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-hosted cages made of boron atoms, hydrogen and carbon are bound by metal atoms, in this case by cobalt.
Traditional and Persistent Virus
HIV protease is a HIV virus protein that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV virus accumulation, mature viral particles would not arise.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In the work published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are combined with a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
Something weaker, but more reliable.
The effect of this series of HIV proteases was tested in the faeces and also against its robust (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallic carboran on the usual variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of clinical medicinal products, but does not lose its effect for resistant variants that are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of effect and also its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical adjustments, as well as metal carbourans make interesting combinations for further research aimed at the proposal of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlín Rezáčová, director of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS has left for Fischer, he's defending himself.
The chief of ODS Mirek Topolánek appointed the approved budget for next year for "fearsome" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider other existences according to him.
The statement of ODS was made by the president of the government for strong years.
He's leaving time for his analysis.
ODS Vice-President Petr said that the concept of an official office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and Greens is no longer clearly working.
The President of the Government, according to the Netherlands, must decide whether or not he intends to set up a minority in the snowfall, which is about fighting a growing deficit, or whether he is in a position to be reduced by means of a parliamentary left.
Access to ODS and social democracy to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, he warned Nezem.
On Wednesday, September 2010, the budget for 2010 was adopted, however, with left-wing proposals for more than 12 billion crowns.
Svemovan has raised money for the salaries of civil servants, for the operation of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
With the exception of the government at the address of the proposals, social democracy was that they secretly visit the budget.
The Czech Republic should host 163 billion kroner.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, expressed the Government's wish that the revised budget was even less bad than the budget provisional.
Disillusionment and vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of the disappointment and feeling of guilt, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government is still evaluating the situation.
In time, it is convinced that if Janota was seriously threatened by leaving the office in the event of the adoption of the amendments, the situation might seem different.
According to Czech TV, Janota ordered the Prime Minister on Monday after the government.
He indicated that he was considering further interruptions in the function.
That's why he's disappointed in the budget discussion.
If Fischer is speaking for another battle with the budget deficit, they do not, according to the Untimely Government, do what the nominees of the ČSSD have done, which has passed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will issue a demise if the House approves other laws of increasing deficits, such as those relating to hospital, pension, or service law.
Topolyek: Ministers of Nomination ODS did not Province
It's the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ODS nomination ministers did nothing wrong, highlighted Topolánek in the US text report.
He recalled that a number of ministries were in the job functions of people reporting to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
In time, he stressed that if Fischer decides to retire to the principle of combating the high level of public finances, "it is quite logical and correct that he takes care of the left-wing majority that is currently in the warehouse".
But then he can't count on the support and tolerance of the civil democrats.
I didn't think about it, and when it's happening, I'm going to do it, I'm going to tell the reporters in the House of Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government by the citizens of the Democratic Republic.
Prime Minister Fischer left for the European Council in Brussels this afternoon.
At the request of the ODS Prime Minister
At the same time, he stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday if the Prime Minister of the Civil Democrats did not explicitly request that the budget be adopted.
We don't look like orphans, we're not little children, then we've responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political debate on the budget did not weigh the inability of the president of Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
When I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the following months it was going to be primarily about the Bolshevik and the destruction of everything positive, Topoljek himself responded.
According to the new ČD order, less trains are going for almost the same rides
The Czech route from December 13 will cancel or limit some less heavily charged speeds and localities, other connections will strengthen.
The total volume of transport shall be reduced from the date of entry into force of the new driving order as compared to today by two percent.
Most of the rates including the basic and customer's fare will not change.
For example, the people of Ostravska get more connections to the main city, and the routes on this track add one set of pendolins.
On the contrary, the speed will stop driving to Bratislava.
Less fast drivers will also drive to the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, mainly limiting the direct connections of Prague - Letohrad.
The regions plan to reduce transport to the UK, with a total of eight per cent, to an increase of Prague and the surrounding area.
There are also two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route and the operation of several speeds on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route is limited to a few days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of new direct links from Milovic to Prague, today Milovic has to move to Lysé nad Lab.
It is about the 15th line of the Esco urban system, its opening is possible due to the completion of the electricity line from Lysé nad Lab to Milovic.
The remote connections to the main city will end at the Prague Central Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Schumperka/Jeseník will go at two hours intervals.
From December 13th, the passengers will no longer be bound.
This year's regional railway account: 200 million more
The fasts are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, and the total amount of the so-called manifest loss will be paid to the dragons of the next year four billion crowns, as will this year. The locals will order countries, the total will pay for them next year eight billion crowns, which will make a contribution to the state of non-three billion countries.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The locals and the fasts have the paths of a newly concluded ten-year contract, so far there has always been a contract for one year.
The routes are appreciated by the system, and therefore they have apparently not been able to increase the prices of the dreary majority of vehicles.
Changes only occur in single-day network drives CSD Net and cheap eLiška websites.
For travellers without a customer card the price of CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLišky will be new from the distance taken, so far has been the same for the journey between any local cities and made 160 crowns.
The Philippine Armed Forces still hold over 50 people, Children were released
Soldiers today in southern Philippines took 75 people, including a number of elementary school students and their teachers.
It was introduced by the AFP agency, which initially only informed about 65 abductions.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 armed men use their arms as a living shield when fleeing from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the issue of the remaining arms.
According to the AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP Police Agency, the kidnapping was initially followed by violence, which required the settlement of accounts between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed was declared a state of law.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November were 30 journalists related to elections to the Government Office.
The governor of this Yugoslav province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the Ampatuan family, were arrested for suspicion of participation in the massacre.
On the island of Mindanao are also active Muslim separatists.
But on Tuesday, they renewed their peace talks with the Philippine government.
The JAR story concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film, Clint Eastwood Invictus (official name in Czech reads Invictus: Undefeated), which captures part of the life story of former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of a world-famous fighter against apartheid was replaced by Morgan Freeman, who chose Mandela himself for his creation years ago.
The next male role of the legendary South African champion in the astrologer Francoise Pienaara was replaced by Matt Damon.
With the introduction of the image into the cinema, they stand out from the voices of criticisms and the public
Nelson Mandela
On 18 July 1918, Nelson Rolihahl Mandela was born in the South African Union.
In 1988 he received the price of freedom of thought, and in 1993 he joined the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerke.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
high expectations, because it comes to the public at a time when in the South African Republic, however, the world championships are being prepared in football, but at the same time the media are exacerbating disturbing reports of rising racial hatred and discrimination on the part of the black government.
According to the AP reporting agency, the announcements to the new film in JAR for the time being are all positive, even though a number of prizes are in favour of containing the main roles of the "problem" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the new movie according to his words.
I've been dreaming about the role for years, and I've been getting ready for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela personally many times to, as it is said, boosted his energy, led the conversation after the film premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can mention Mandel's personality and message in the film.
It's the story of the South African Republic, but it's about everyone, he's given.
As part of the national football team
Image based on a book presentation by British writer John Carlin with a freely translated name In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that led to the creation of the nation portraits the South African human rights stand during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying to get two races in the course of the film, and after many years of mutually defined population groups and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he is also taking part in the sheer role of the South African National Rugby Dress at the World Cup game, which JAR won at the time.
For entrance to the lawn in a dress, which is almost understood in JAR as the most sacred thing, Mandela huddled a large sheep mostly of the white audience fourteen years ago and gained recognition of the white population.
The football championship, as if it could reunite people into one nation, introduced the football player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the hurrying situation in the JAR improves will only show up.
However, white South Africans are skeptical, for example, in a recent LN interview, the fan of Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsk, the transformer burns for tens of millions of crowns
In the morning, the company transformer Čeps in the divorce at the village of Výškov in Lounsk.
According to the speaker of the rural fires, Lucas Marvana has six units in the fire.
Originally, the firemen wanted to let the transformer burn, but later they reassessed the opinion and fire extinguishes the mixture of water, drink, and special resins.
The reason was a technical failure, the internal from the transformer.
No one was injured, the accident, according to Paully Mandat's spokesman, threatens the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at tens of millions of crowns, precisely counting it will work until the fire is over.
The destroyed transformer will have to replace the Mandate with a new one.
In ten years, the company’s action was nothing like it, the charges of this type were isolated, supplemented.
The supply of electricity was not affected, according to CEZ spokesperson for the northern Czech Soni Holinger's Hendrichs, by the operation of the household, by the authorities or by the company, by the fire of the traffic station.
A.s. Šeps acts on the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, electrical control 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 divorced transformers with 67 transformers converting electrical energy from transmission to distribution system and a 4339 km long driving path.
Jancura gives a criminal notice for a three-heitman talk from ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jancura today gives a criminal notice for the talk on three social-democratic heitmanes.
And it's at Michala Haška from the South Moravian region, Radko Martínka from the Pardubic region and the Heitman of the Olomouk region of Martin Tessarík.
Janchura introduced it in the 20 minutes of the Radio Journal.
The complaint relates to the company's efforts to operate regional train transport in some countries.
All regions, however, have finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech Dragons.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about choosing roses, and then we just made an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are dearer than the Czech streets, which is not true, because we know the prices of the Czech treasures that were closed last week.
So we don't have time to defend ourselves.
It's for a talk with the Student Agency, said the Janchure Radio Journal.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all countries that he had not taken his steps in accordance with European law.
It is therefore prepared to propose to the European Commission.
The press release has been considered as another continuation of Mr. Janchury's media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertising of his company and his own.
I am, of course, prepared to raise the good name of my country and to the same challenge as the other heroes.
I assume that even on this occasion it is clear that it is Mr Janchura who manipulates the public in the area of regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, Hasek has introduced.
Janchura announced last week that he is investing a few million crowns in advertising that will not be worth the country's attention.
The newspaper said that after Christmas the campaign will be interrupted and continued after New Year's.
He said that the campaign would be directed against corruption like that.
The campaign began after the countries agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Dragons and the order about 150 billion crowns did not produce trends.
According to Janchure, the same proceedings are illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of rail transport in the countries, Janchuro was already threatening the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't let it go, we can get a bus license.
He was represented as a member of the ČSSD, I know what the gentleman is talking about, I won't say his name, said the Janchure Radio Journal today.
Pneumococcal expectations will be free and non-compulsory
Expectation against the tyres from the ice will absorb the usual habits.
It's supposed to be the first for families free and at the same time not required.
But the voices are already claiming that it would be more effective to expect.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal spraying.
The medical institution is already setting maximum prices for vaccines that will pay health insurance.
The experts are also clear in the process of anticipation.
New Circumstances
Free vaccines for children of snakes
From the ice can be provided free of charge against children who were born on 2 August and later.
The condition is that they haven't even received a single dose of puppies yet.
Anyone who started to look at the past or before must pay for another review.
The first dose of pregnancy must be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
She volunteered to let her children watch over the tires of a quarter of a family last year.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose and more.
When the youngest children are expected, four doses are needed.
The total amount of health insurance is estimated to be 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year.
But they're going to save for the treatment the kids would need without waiting.
So far, for all of the field expectations of children, he gave about 500 thousand years a year.
The prized expectation was introduced by the so-called Janoto package.
Pneumococcal causes central ear inflammation, but also serious infections including strokes of the brain and blood vessels.
In the case of a pneumonia infection, the patient dies in a year, according to a patient study of up to 28 children under 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, there have been a threat of child pneumococcal pneumococcal pectoris in 40 countries.
Will waiting be compulsory?
At the same time, however, opinions appear that this expectation could be compulsory in the future.
From the ice, it's supposed to be threatened with insurance and non-compulsory.
For example, the chief of the civil association Nałas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that it would be better to expect.
His Pneumococcal Vaccine Association has been promoting for a long time.
Experts at the international conference that our association attended were not fully satisfied with our voluntary expectations.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we're glad that we managed to do at least this.
I think it's the road that we need to reach now, brought in the Kalovski.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcal expectations.
At this point, we are not considering it at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sršený said.
Voluntary expectation has its advantages, doctors claim
The president of the Expert Society of Practical Child Doctors, Han Cabrnoch, acknowledges that he has a voluntary expectation of his disadvantages.
If all children were treated, it might be considered to reduce the number of reviews "For the situation where this vaccine is so high, we understand fairly the political decision that it was launched as voluntary," said Cabrnochová, of course.
Experts expect that their cubs will have more than 80 per cent of fresh parents to fight against pneumococcals from next year.
Pneumococcal pneumococcal pneumococcal pneumoccal pneumocal pneumocal pneumocal pneumoccal pneumocal pneumocal pneumocal pneumocal pneumocals, not state it as the first surface pneumocal pneumocal pneumocals pneumocal pneumocals pneumocals, not state it.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, save for further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy the drugs themselves.
However, it is related to the care of practical child doctors involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, vaccines should be purchased from insurance companies, and doctors would receive them as much as the state supplies them to others.
But some Members were afraid that insurance companies could "make money out of health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the substances and wait for them to be paid.
According to estimates, individual practical child doctors will invest in the vaccine 40,000 monthly, which is a significant amount.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist 's been stealing in the museum'
The son of the renowned American fantastic maker Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal images worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught in loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
Mr. Frazetta and the other man used to break into the museum in the Poconco Mountains Bagr region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, aged 81, celebrated the creation of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time that it happened, the artist was in Florida, as the Press Associated Press said.
The AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying that Mr Frazette's younger brother could have been motivated by long-term family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr Frazette issued a younger sworn statement, 52 years old, that he did so at his father's direction, "to get to the museum in any way possible and move images to the ice-cream," the agency said.
Mr. Frazetta, the senior, refused to grant any such permission, as the agency has indicated.
Labourers defend the planned increase of taxes
The Ministers advocated the increase in the expenditure and the cuts announced in the preliminary report on the budget against the criticism of the opposition, entrepreneurs and committees.
As Alistair Darling pointed out, Tory's "spoiled" option to show that he meant a serious postponement of the decision to reduce the deficit to a time after the elections.
And the office got under fire because of the injuries of low- and middle-income workers.
According to its proposal, this is mainly a 0.5% increase in social insurance and a 1% adjustment in public payments since 2011.
Social security security protection
The committees protested that low-income workers were subjected to a recession that they did not commit and warned against "problems".
Social insurance increases - an increase of about 3 billion pounds a year - which has led the community of entrepreneurs who have stated that it is employment tax, while the focus should be on economic recovery.
This increase, which limits these revenues to more than 20,000 pounds a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PBR key points
Social insurance will be increased by another 0,5 % since April 2011
The economic situation is going to worsen by 4,75 % this year than expected.
New tax 50 % of bankers' bonuses
Growth 1% of company tax for small companies
Reduction of taxes on motor vehicles and wind power plants
Increase in income measurement by 2,5 %
According to the estimate of the government, some revenues of 30000 pounds are reduced by 90 pounds per year and some revenues of 40000 pounds are reduced by 190 pounds, while some revenues of 10000 pounds are increasing by 110 pounds.
The Ministers announced that their target of half-deficit reduction by 2013 was "complex decision-making", but insisted that 60% of special taxes should fall to 5% of those with the highest income.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argued that the proposed increase in taxes and spending restrictions would be "a drop in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"It's a big number, which allows us to reduce half the deficit, which is a fundamental requirement for the next four years," the BBC reported.
Mr Timms stated that he is convinced that the growth of the economy should come at the end of the year.
But drawing up a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of the necessary loans and the speed with which the deficit will be reduced - must be a threshold after the official has been brought to review the previous amounts.
In its opinion, the decline in the economy was 4.75 % this year - far worse than the 3.5 % reduction predicted in April - because loans were 3 billion pounds higher than previously estimated.
Prolonged opportunity'
The conservatives who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warning against the "debt crisis" of laborers, marked a planned loan of 789 billion pounds over the next six years for inefficient.
The ministers failed to submit a credible plan as to how this could be done, added, "cynics" postponed this decision until after the elections - which must be held by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant to what would be feasible," said the shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had the chance to do it, but they blinded it."
"All important announcements will be made by election if we win them "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourers insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future gaps unlike the Tory's proposals, which would want to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But liberal democrats claim that the money obtained by increasing taxes and cutting costs should be used to support expenditures in the coming year rather than to reduce deficits, and argue that the plans are "based on sand".
The BBC political commentator Nick Robinson stated that the time of the announcement - for example, the above inflation is increasing and the inability to pay the dose in the next April - could lead to the charge of the election campaign's office if the money was hard to get back a year later.
However, workers are continuing to provide special assistance if they are very needy and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
Suspected budget'
Although the ministers did not disclose the details of the expenditure after 2011, the economists stated that it is clear that the reduction in public expenditure would only be at the beginning of the mid-term restrictions.
The recognised Institute of Budgetary Studies has reported that office figures indicate significant gaps in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education and defence in the building.
"It's really painful so far," said his director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the elections if we win them," Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to the Republika S. Deloitte account.
"It was a report on the suspect preliminary budget, and the markets are implementing it."
The FBI is conducting an investigation in 'American Prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation into the Pakistan prison of five Americans suspected of connecting to extremists.
Men were arrested for assault on the house in Sargoda in the province of eastern Pandjab, as the BBC announced the American embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI reported that it was an investigation into the same man who was declared unrecognizable in the last month in their home in the American state of Virginia.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also stated that it is also about obtaining information about these men.
Three of them are said to be the origins of Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and the other come from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances under which they were held," said Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit reported that the agency was informed of the arrest and was in contact with families of the missing students.
"We cooperate with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their conduct here and whether they really are wrong students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington found that men were arrested in a house belonging to a uncle of one of them.
It stated that the house was always in the centre of the local police's interest and that the charges had not yet been brought against the men in custody.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, told the press agency Reuters, but stated that the United States must "co-operate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in disengaging the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people".
The disappearance of these five students from home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Refusing amnesty for Iranian tyrants.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, as the Amnesty International Group's export report states.
The report describes in detail "the methods of torture" in the regime before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected the above criticism of this report on the observance of human rights.
Officials have identified this criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were imprisoned and dozens of them were killed after the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinekjad, leading to the greatest street demonstration since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Tens of them were imprisoned, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five people to death.
The BBC writer in Tehran John Leyne, now in London, stated that earlier in protests, the highest leader of Ayjatoláh Ali Chomejní declared some forms of torture invalidity and prohibited their execution in the Karizak correctional facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the legal power has been tolerated, as our author has indicated.
False confession'
Amnesty International quoted the report of a 26-year-old student in the field of computer technology, Ibrahim Methari, who stated that he was accused of "working on Facebook's network" and of protests against the results of the elections.
"I've often been face-to-face," he said in a statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes in my eyes, on my neck, on my head, they threatened me with correction and humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconsciously, Amnesty said.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charrubi was detained after the elections and was sentenced to death in prison and the others were raped.
The Iranian senior state officials rejected the charges of rape, but they allowed the torture to occur.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of an ex-con who stated that he was kept in a container with 75 others for a period of more than eight weeks in Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty admitted that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate electoral problems and government reactions, but stated that the mandate and authority of the authorities were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group stated that at least 90 persons were detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park, a ski resort was created
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to change the memory in Bristol in the main race route.
The race route to the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prices.
At the top of the train station in Brandon Hill Park was a short ski resort before 100 m long train stop.
A fourth-year-old medical student, John Hickman, said it was a wonderful view from the top of the highway, but it was really interesting.
It was a beautiful view of the bright lights of the city down.
Here were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
Prices were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the highway.
After the fourth night's race, the snow was left to rest.
They're still with us.
Can he be a Muslim Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in secular state.
At the time when the Swiss voters called for a ban on the construction of minerals and in general the terrible reports about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, the American Academy wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslims could be integrated - and whether they were integrated - into one of the most unopened secular societies of the continent.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, became admirers of the author's last work, "Why the French don't like hats on their heads" (2006), this elegant and debated study on controversial issues that divide and employ the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and much more ambitious picture.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened on the basis.
He spent months in the mosques, schools and institutions that are now looking after 5 to 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He's a good listener, he reproduces debates between teachers and students on issues that concern them most.
Should Muslims enter a marriage in a mosque or in a workshop (or in both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does Muslims have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system if they want to obtain a mortgage?
These are apparently the world’s controversial issues discussed, which are part of daily life rather than the political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of names, teachers and intellectuals, among other commonly known persons, does not exclude Tarika Ramadan, Araba, Muslim researcher and academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how it can be a good Muslim and a good citizen in modern secular society.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are not trusted with the true idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr Bowen conducted the interview are committed to the domain that it is the anti-Polish of Salaf—priviers of the Sunni Islam purist, associated in Saudi Arabia—this group is small, but affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
The question is how far French politicians (and intellectual elites who are so concerned with the secular public) are actually given the idea of pluralism.
It is the view that Muslims have probably less experience in the questions of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to compromise historically with secular republics.
More than the development of pragmatism, they found "shrewing the values of screws".
After reading this book, someone may have a tendency to say, "Yes, but not now."
The Best Look in the World
The Arctic is changing faster than the other environments of the planet.
Protecting ice is the alarming speed that affects animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishery companies must be focused on new natural sources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they wake up.
In the book "On thin ice" Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, like the natural history of the North icon, polar bear.
Well-known with complicated history and velvety procedures, it describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to strengthen the white bear.
The admiral Nelson's meeting with a brave 14-year-old swimmer who fought only with the shell of the Muskete is really myth, but all the others are true.
Young bears who were swimming behind their dead mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared suddenly in a circus state.
Even today zoo gardens typically have a million times smaller area than the area available for adults in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the world hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis is exhausting from the work of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Even though hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunting from helicopters and Indians on the slopes and all are armed by powerful attackers who shoot their own prey.
Ironically, it's taking place in the water north of these two hunting nations and the ice will finally be the biggest.
In his new book "After Ice" Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and unsatisfied responsibility for the Arctic science and a long-term perspective on how the future can change it.
Not all scientists have answers.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have an adequate response to the rate of change.
That's for lack of testing.
The research trails of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century marked the first time the movement of the floating ice.
The winter wars were then wiped out by the sinking wind as they sailed.
Satellite research and the extensive field of probes in the floating glaciers are a useful supplement, but many continue to be made thanks to the safest individuals living in the winter.
Mr. Anderson is looking at the extremely fragile world of the soil system within the Arctic ice, created by the accumulation of salt water, which melts when frozen.
But from the height of the bear to the microscopic wonders, it's all doomed to decay as the summer ice moves, which sometimes takes place between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... it can be us'
6000 members of the seabed placed bonds on the graves in Arlington
Officer De'Angelo Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to put a simple window on the tomb of a soldier he never met.
For him and the other members of the seamen who took a trip from Johnson camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Tombs in Arlington, to recover the graves, that was the day when they took hold of men and women who used to wear the same shoes.
In a few months, when we get in, we can be, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If it happens to us, I'd like someone to do the same for me to show me respect as I do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to place the prisoners on the cemetery of veterans in several departments at the London Friday act.
In 1992, Morril Worcester, owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, initiated this tradition when he and several others decided to restore several hundred graves in the London Friday act.
Now it's an 18-year-old tradition when Mr. nMorill and his wife, Karen, take this trip every year and stop in different cities along the way to remember members of the army and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters are not looking for any profit, the debts against America, which they have in other countries.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 beers in the London cemetery, the Pentagon area, the National cemetery Fayetteville in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and 93 United Airlines in Shanksville in the state of Pennsylvania.
For the second year, Walmart's donation is worth more than $1,150,000 for the purchase and transport of bees.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, stated that she had taken a trip to Arlington to honor her husband, a retired member of the armed forces.
Because her husband was not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way back to what the victim was doing.
It's a small way that citizens can support our units, she said.
It's like a family grave visit.
Inflated in the tiles of the warm substance, volunteers walked through the cemeterys around the lawns and pahorice.
Volunteers turned to older graves of the first and second world wars and wars in Vietnam, because these are not visited as often as new graves
Suddenly, it was positive when the children played and held their hands together when they carried a young bull to our gravestones.
Every round wedding was dark green with a small red doll on the top of the dog.
Nearly 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, have remained truly silent.
The United Service Organization has dedicated 1,000 volunteers to repair the branch, but the cloudy order of the war just in progress has filled this area.
Some sincerely wept, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in cold air.
Some read a note of the name, thrown into the rocks, while others agreed to look at the small black-white names, pressed into the wet mud where the burial stones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who had tears from their eyes in front of her son's grave.
She went eight hours from Zanesfield in Ohio to visit the last resting place of Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. ..my son paid for it, rules.
"Even though I've been gone for a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
US Government supplier imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government imprisoned an American government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as foreign ministry officials indicated on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for the Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, together with the U.S. section of interest in Havana, sought access to the detainee who had been imprisoned on 5 December.
Certain charges have not been published, unless, under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is marked as "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-circumvention graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are monitored and burdened by government agents.
Mrs. Sánchez repeatedly requested permission to leave the country so that she could take over the price, but the permission was denied.
The detention of an American supplier may be the result of the growing tension between the communist Castro brother, the ruler of Cuba, and Obama's administration, which was followed by "holding tactics" in improving relations with the island.
As the first to report on the New York Times incarceration on Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in the country where the average salary of the state employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones just this year; these are used mostly by sending text messages, because the 15-minute telephone call would be more than one day’s wages.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
The Cubans who often want to sign in must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The detention of the American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the crowd of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind the drug trafficking networks, led by Gloria Berbenová, the press office of the American Interests Section in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about the prison.
The arrest and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open company - let's say free mobile phones - are criminal in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the American programme for the observance of human rights, who recently published an unfavourable report on Cuba's freedoms, called "New Castro, tataz Cuba," as an attack on Raula Castra as the leader of the country and a reward for his dear older brother Fidel.
Vivanco stated that the complaints were often arrested, tried and imprisoned within one day.
He pointed out that all the solutions would be more political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just when these two countries focus on a wider dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are covering up a conspiracy regarding the sending of men to Afghanistan.
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered a leading conspiracy regarding the sending of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American units there, and stated that they hoped that this case could help spread the wide network of terrorists who follow the Internet and search for radicalized young men.
The investigators stated that they were searching for the shadow of the generation, known as Saifulláh, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first found out when one of these men released a comment, approving terrorist attacks on YouTube.
Saifilláh took care of the leadership of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan in the ranks of the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its camps for the training of terrorists.
But the Pakistani intelligence officer who reported the case stated on Saturday that Saifulláh was unsuccessful in certifying the commanders of al-Qaeda and that men were not part of the CIA attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, a few days later, they were cut off to the eastern quarter of Sarghoda, far from the horrific mountains in the north-west, which became a refuge for terrorists.
They were considered a force force.
The reason they were expelled was given by an official who spoke of maintaining anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case.
The official stated that men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain consent to access the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was investigated by the FBI - highlights the critical role of the recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important, the determination of who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. intelligence service has given the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaida.
The organizers of the organization act as guards, cutting out those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be explorers.
The American fake recruits were detailed in al-Qaeda's special examination, analysts noted.
But they were also considered to be extremely interesting in the group because given their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an elder analyst at the NEFA Foundation in the United States, has stated that terrorist groups have also become much more careful in recent years, allowing the victim to join them because the US intelligence agencies have gained expertise in their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to act according to their recruitment model, which has already been monitored so much? Mr Kohlmann said.
This model is one of those that is far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Kodani, demanded climate action
Tens of the protests marched down the streets this Saturday and demanded more action on climate from the negotiators at the town convention center Bell.
The protesting indicated the number of statistical participants in this event, but the police say the number was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists placed several small stakes near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day that a small event took place during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists went through the city and carried transparency with English inscriptions "This is not a planet B" (i.e. second century) and one in Spanish, which said "the country says 'quit'."
The protest took part in several celebrations including Danish models and photographers by Helena Christensen, who stated that she had been travelling to her mother's home in Peru and provided me with information about the state of the country in which the climate change continues to affect.
That's a partial reason why we decided to join this big move -- to go through the world and appeal to the world's leaders to submit a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, said.
It's not an easy task, but it's necessary to do it, it can't be avoided.
The police prevented the protestant from approaching the center of Bella and stated that she kept 19 people, first of all because either they had wearing masks or they had hat knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during the demonstration.
According to one of the unaccompanied spectators, who do not want to be identified, because they are involved in climate talks, masking activists as athletes and in black suits have placed a number of bets near the Kodan main channel, which is located near a number of ministries.
They were agitating the buildings, entering, lighting the lights, but then they followed "many large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march in the afternoon.
But protest probably did not penetrate the knowledge of key officials, such as Su Wei, the leading Chinese climate negotiator.
When asked whether, despite the demonstration, it had a constructive impact on international negotiations, English replied "Currently, that is something that I was not aware of" (actually it is something I don't know).
Then he went on in the Chinese and said, "Because the incident is huge, I can't hear what's going on out there."
He was watching whether the march was painful or helpful depending on the appearance of each one.
It is visible that the public and the various sectors and the subject of climate change are concentrated, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that it is a violation of the union or the freedom of others.
Test data revealed persistent racial differences
Last week's federal certificate on the knowledge gained from mathematics was welcomed by the element of the good news about Columbia County Public School.
Although the district is far behind the country’s high performance systems, the certification has shown greater progress among the fourth and eighth grade students in the last two years than in the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Certificate Centre for Progress in Education are persistent differences in the knowledge gained between African American and white students, both on the local and on the national page.
The average result of the fourth class white students in Columbia County for the last two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (from 500 possible), but only three points have increased from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge achieved has indeed increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
The progress of Africans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with the exception of a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average score in white subjects was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The image in the horizon of six years is not just encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth grade students in 2003 when the first NAEP was carried out in the county was 60 degrees (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference was close to 58.
In the last week, some circuit educators said that the results, celebrated by the mystery of Michelle A. Rhee and the old man Adrian M. Fentym (D) were more stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
This would suggest that we have increased the scope of support for those at the highest end of the stage, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, Executive Director D.C. Voice, non-divisional groups that advocate equality of education in the county.
I didn't jump up and down for a two or three points, said a member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of primary school in Eaton.
Often criticizing the style of Mrs. Rhee's administration, Mrs. Brown said that reporting the results of the tests means that high school in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
It's obvious that you always want to see the puzzles, and I respect it.
But what's amazing is that we didn't spend almost any time and energy that we needed to devote to our high school.
Mrs. Rhee said that the Church's effort is to continue to look for better ways to address the needs of students with low results.
For example, some teachers are trained in the use of new reading bases, Wilson's reading system, focused on students of the higher classes of primary schools and high school students who have not been able to master the reading bases before in their careers, are significantly left behind.
Each day, mathematics and the basics of mathematics education in the sixth grade, highlighting the real life games and experiences that came into the county as former director of Clifford Janey, can be attributed to the NATO progress report last week.
And I think we should continue to work and do the best we can with the students who stay in the classroom, Mrs. Rhee said.
Others argued that the results of NAEP explained the question whether Mrs Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and continue to provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain saved dilemma of Mrs. Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The Conventional Reform Procedure is to focus funds and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of Columbia County.
Thus, the focus can bring political signals that are directed against an important agenda.
However, the rise is also among the other city directors who are trying to maintain the average diameter between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of large schools.
We need to use our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can rely on their children to provide excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now the school director in Newark, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional school year, currently 180 days in the county to achieve school rights.
You have to get up to 200 days to make changes, said Mr. Janey, who has entered into a contract with his teacher association last year for the school year in 185 days, which is considered a "remark" for seeking a greater increase next year.
Make higher education part of the better future
The train bus went to the Gettysburg College with a loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, came out and began for a moment in white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns..
Graciela's parents were having a hard time at high school in El Salvador.
So far Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the college.
Now she and other students in the eight classes in the group were studying Gettysburg, where the school made $38690 a year, their position was more than alarming visitors of the enthusiasm of potential students.
Yes, that's it! she called Graciela who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really?
The Pennsylvania Railway was one of the seven who visited their class entrance and were now fully engaged in the future report: The question is not whether you enter the college.
The question is from where.
However, this is a bore problem regarding the high number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants, who are excluded from high schools or pregnant as a non-flight, but there are statistics of those who receive further education and thus enter the secondary class.
In fact, five of these "long generation" Spanish students from college - remarkable results have shown that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and residents of Central America, have gone to the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers point out, because it supports their point of travel ahead for a generation that played a territorial role in the field of the country's labour force.
Those who have reached high school say they have a natural tendency to go to school and have a natural tendency and a sense of urgency and effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and millions of children who would like to graduate - especially if these efforts persist in time.
If we look at the fact that children come from low-income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to help them navigate in the system, any simple intervention at each point does not solve it, says Patricia Gándar, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, where she studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a pre-school network in every way they can clean up high school.
The federal program that financed Graciely's train ride is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (appropriate), it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch further preparatory programs that start for students from groups with small incomes in high schools and continue until these students graduate from high school.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, of whom more than % have joined the college, according to the US Ministry of Education data.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry has reached agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Notwithstanding the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has succeeded in accepting significant oil companies to rebuild its non-denominated infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
The ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry with foreign oil companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in the reconstruction of the Iraqi oil industry, protected by decades of war and sanctions.
The US companies were transferred with capital participation to just two out of 10 disbursed fields.
Seven American companies paid for their participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
Only one has submitted a lost offer.
Two American companies reached an agreement on the field that was held in June.
The general participation of American oil giants in the open-ended Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies you have here in the first row on the way to Asia and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, online reporting.
It's gonna be a long time before there's anything else in Iraq for sale.
Security concerns, accentuated by mass-coordinated attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the US army's landing, are likely to reflect American companies from a much more intensive company in Iraq, which has manifestly the third largest raw materials reserves, analysts say.
In some cases, American companies have been in disadvantages, in particular the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that have concluded agreements with the ministry.
The previous American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, who maintained close contact with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry and offered technical assistance in the past years, were sent with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers on more contracts than all other companies and went with large shares in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become a major economic force, as well as a technological force, has spoken to the Assam Jihad oil industry.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparable to competition and meet its obligations towards Iraq.
The companies that were previously selected for the submission of tenders, which were then compared to the Ministry at the price of bars, and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level in each field.
The spy al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
With the impact of the US missile at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, it was likely that a peak planner of Al-Qaida operations was killed, as US Anti-Terrorist Division officials announced on Friday.
As confirmed, it could be a second deadly attack on one of the highest leaders of terrorists.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets hit their car on Thursday near the city of Miran Şáh in the province of North Vaziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have ruled that the missiles were fired from the airport without a type of crew operating with the CIA in the ranks of illegal native tribes.
They were listed on a white car that was heading to the Afghan border when it was hit, and the official introduced the Pakistani civilian intelligence agency that was calling from Miran Šáh.
The official stated that the local armed men had turned to the point and quickly had fun, which was left of "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. anti-terrorism officials quoted an unspecified witness who claimed that Somalia was after death.
Somalia was introduced as a highly-established al-Qaida military planner who led terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in renovating the world, said a senior official who refused to be appointed who indicated the sensitive nature of American air strikes in Pakistan.
If he stood in such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was given instructions from Al-Qaeda's highest leadership and was planning possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another U.S. official said that Somalia quickly acted in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He didn't have to be a known person in general for some Americans, but he didn't mean in any way to invite us and our associates, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second highly established leader of al-Qaeda or Taliban to be killed since September when Najmudin Jalolov was killed in a similar attack, the leader of the militant group in the ranks of native tribes, and three other chief populace leaders.
The rate of attacks initiated by the CIA by unmanned aircraft has been reduced from the average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to the Long War newspaper records, websites, managed by the non-profit group.
The reduction may have a reason for improving the tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also unintentionally killing the persons suspected of being informants, has introduced the page.
The United Nations High Representative in Kabul has resigned.
The High Representative of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated on Friday that he would want to resign from his post in March and would end such a stormy period of office, which had been condemned by the allegations of widespread corruption in the election of the President of Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure is due because Obama's administration has decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations delegate stated that it supported the increase, but expressed concern that the US timetable for reducing the state, which began 18 months later, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their powers.
We need to accelerate the building of Afghan security forces and send the correct signal to the Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment accepted must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian workers helping with the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of the civilians, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign, but that he simply fulfilled the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he spent only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon now stated he would need time to find a refund.
As I said, it's time to look after the successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban started looking for a refund.
The officials stated that it was decided between Staffan di Misturou, who had Swedish-Italian origin and had previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jeanem-Maria Guéhenn, France, who had previously led the UN peace operation.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzám, who won the earthly presidential elections by masking the presence of massive electoral machines.
Eide rejected this claim, but stated that Galgraith's accusation -- which was released -- "was certainly damaged by the mission, because there was a high level of spelt with regard to international intervention" in the election.
Eide pointed out that he proposed a meeting with the highest representative of the citizens for the coordination of relief efforts in the conduct of the United States force in Afghanistan.
He also ordered the United Nations leadership to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries who would lend them to the Afghan mission, because he said he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money was properly used.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limited efforts in Afghanistan and stated that the difficult United Nations regulation on hire is undermining its ability to use its capacity.
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to get only one person from May, I said.
It's a disaster and I can't keep going.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon set up "more significant sanctions" on Iran due to the lack of involvement in talks about his nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to areas where they are fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, have baffled the prospect of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to the military question of probable development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I've learned something from Iraq in the last six years, [it] is unimaginable invisibility in the war.
Obama's administration has decided on a package of sanctions that could affect the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also be granted to ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a package of incentives and bans" would require "to get the Iranian government to really feel less secure with nuclear weapons", because "their inhabitants will suffer exceptionally" with sanctions.
According to a Friday opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has taken the lead in warning that Iran will have serious consequences unless it leads its nuclear programme to full compliance with the UN Committee on Nuclear Safety and its supervisory authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During the discussions in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to the talks on limiting his nuclear programme and agreed that he would provide a substantial part of his enriched uranium resources in exchange for the essential fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The Administration established such an agreement as a way to establish trust between the two parties and to obtain time for negotiations.
But since that time, it seems that Iran is derogating from the interim agreements - partly so, the expert points out, because the Iraqi leadership is divided into opinions on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, as regards Iran's hard-working towards the international community in the case of some of the proposals that he actually agreed to in early October, I think it brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together on a road that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set the deadline for 31 December for Iran to respond to proposals before returning to the search for other elections, including monitoring, which will foreign ministers Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions".
In a statement issued in New York, an Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned on Thursday what it called "indecent and unsubstantiated accusations" before some members of the Security Committee on Iranian Nuclear Activities and stated that it wanted to continue in talks with the United States and five other world powers "for achieving a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to Kurdistan, rich in oil to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with the Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
It maintains high tensions between Kurda and the Iraqi majority, in particular due to borders, ownership rights and income distribution.
Gtes insisted on both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts in order to prevent US plans from being suspended to limit the number of US soldiers from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to resolve Kurdish anxiety from persistent depression. U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzaani, President of the Kurdistan regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in the united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In ancient China, change in course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, where they read that "The Earth's Mother is too exhausted to enjoy more children" and "One child also means one more grave".
Then they learned that when the official government seats in Shanghai, alarmed by low births and ageing populations in their city, suddenly changed the course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We've always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We left nothing for the second, says Wang, 31, human resources manager, who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years of China’s lasting policy to have only one child was introduced and thus created only two generations of notorious bobbleed and gagging children, affected by the "small emperors", the country threatens the population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before the policy entered into force, according to the UN data.
The distribution of the population where the number of inhabitants aged 60 years and above is expected to rise from 16.7 per cent in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
Inequality is more rich coastal cities with a population with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, 60 - year - olds and older people made nearly 22 percent of the registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and reduce the state of the workforce in the future".
He says it's about "to be old, it doesn't mean to be rich -- like in developed countries, like Japan or Sweden."
Slowing down
As the country's constitution was introduced in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is likely to be the most controversial mandate established by the Communist Party's governments.
The two who broke the policy were faced with unrest -- up to their three-year-old pay in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official offices have been prosecuting policies that have helped the country to prevent critical use of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned in promoting politics.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women in the second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many twins had to undergo sexist election losses, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually smaller in their opinion on a child's policy.
In 2004, the training of the exceptions - including city residents, members of national minorities, and cases where men and women were single - and in 2007 they reduced the dictates of their passwords, which proliferated the line.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Peking University Institute of Population Research, said that officials of the central government had already debated radical changes as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was a single.
In June Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Almost overnight there were posters urging parents to have only one child, replaced by copies of the regulation, detailing how the second child would be allowed to have and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family and volunteer planning officials to meet with couples in their homes and put airplanes under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The response was cold, the family planning officials were introduced.
Contingent response
Although officials in one rural town around Shanghai noted an increase in interest in the two who wanted to have a second child after the campaign began, most urban districts did not report changes.
Huinan City District with a population of 115,000, for example, still registered four to five cases a month.
Disappointment officials in Shanghai stated that despite the campaign, the number of people born in the city in 2010 is still expected only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, the head of the family planning committee in the Shanghai district of Caol, stated that financial considerations were probably the main reason people don't want to have more children.
They want to give the best of the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said she would like two children and they were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese who have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a customs network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West blame one child's politics badly as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in connection with the first child.
Yes, we were tempted to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just politics.
It's about money.
Other couples point to psychological reasons for weight gain.
Wang, the manager of human resources, says that they are only caring for one child, because she was also the only one: "We were the center of attention of our families and all cared for us.
We weren't used to provide care, and we actually didn't want to take care of the other.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who was a foreign translation company, said that was much more uncovered.
For two-carriage parents in the middle class who had reduced birth, he said to be successful means to be selfish.
Today, 20 and 30 years of age, adults look at their parents as the first days of the Czech experiment with capitalism and do not want to live this way for themselves, he says.
Just one child puts enormous demands on parents' time, he says.
The mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still controversial questions from the propor -- "You must stop your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You must have a summary prepared at the time when the child is 9 months for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to meet one child, says Che, but not two.
We're the first generation with higher standards of nutrition, he says.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
The United Nations Group has set up a emission reduction plan.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by a long-term undiscovered attitude and mutual sensitization -- refocused on the release of a document on Friday, which proposes ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years with industrialised nations with no burden in the near future.
The text, which may provide a starting point for the final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as highlights the road ahead.
But there was significant progress in the negotiations that went on at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Kodana next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text inevitably indicates how much money rich countries should provide to those poor people to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage the emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon output and what the upper limit of global warming should be, which political actors will still be able to tolerate.
It provides a process with a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequitt, top representative of the Washington Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, deleted from 180 pages of the text of the discussion to focus on what the peak climate officer at the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as a "great image".
It sets out the limits for the possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent per year compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 per cent.
The European Union quickly discussed Friday's pledge to provide $3.6 billion over the next three years in order to help poorer countries adapt to climate change -- from flood management and drought to depleting.
However, on Friday, he introduced a type of verbal fireworks that he was considering during the discussions last week.
The US Special Envoy for Climate Issues Todd Stern refused to say, requiring binding greenhouse gas emission restrictions for industrial countries in comparison to volunteering for the major developing economies, unless they were financed by the developed world.
The mission signalled that Obama's administration had come up with a stronger line towards China away from Bush's administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not accede to the Treaty without the transfer of the major developing countries and the implementation of actions, said Stern, who also stated that the text was not sufficient to ensure restrictions and should be verified by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei told the U.S. chief climate negotiator that either the lack of "selling intelligence" or "extraordinary non-responsibility" led to the week's announcement that the United States would not help China financially in order to deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic path of the world's main powers at stake, the Tahanics have been dashed both inside the developing world and between the industrial world and the developing economies.
The current fight is carried out by most of the individual economies rather than by the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States regarding the fulfilment of their respective commitments, while the poorer nations point out that two tenths of the world's most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative for the implementation of the most important actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegation from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the main powers are fighting who should bear the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive when looking for a way to ban large issuers in their actions.
It is a clear game of developing new economic hegemony, Ulate, who also serves as regional adviser to regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature protection.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to promote a legally binding agreement in Kodana, but most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page proposal for an agreement last Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations in favour of the European Commission, said that prosecuting small island nations "problemed political pressure on the entire polar process" partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The deal sparked new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining controversial issues before the heads of the government were fighting for the agreement.
High position officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister of the Environment, took off the aircraft and went through the halls of the centre of Bell to a closed door and new conferences so they could issue the claims that would be assessed next week.
The vastness of the assembly - when 13000 people moved each day from and to the convention center, the guitars playing activists staged at night ironing the countries they thought had been sent, and came to hand-to-hand motions on paper rather than electronic mail -- a challenge.
Intenzita is only a construction: almost all key ministers were present in Kodana and earlier in the mid60s.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, the Deputy Minister of Global Policy for International Nature Protection.
Heavy weights are coming.
British first train at 140 miles per hour pre-defined this Monday's feeling
at 5:13 a.m., on Monday morning, the witch cut the darkness on the sign of the departure of the train, which meant the revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed personal train in the country will reach 140 miles per hour and spring from Ashford in Kent to London's St Pancras and will exceed 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and entered the first high-speed personal assembly outside of London.
It is hoped that the new service will possibly connect Britain with the international networks of fast, reliable trains and connect great globality to Midland, the north and Scotland with London.
The delayed standing water should reduce the transport time in passenger transport and on commercial routes and the transition from aircraft and cars to railways could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
The three main political parties were theoretically allowed to obtain this vision.
But tens of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental degradation have now accelerated the construction of British high-speed routes.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, delivered its message to Lord Adonis on 30 December, as the Times said.
It provided him with a detailed map of the route of another planned stage of high-speed network.
London's new connection with the West Midlands was proposed within five metres in urban areas and districts, where access to life resorts could be problematic.
In the open area, the final route was planned up to 25 m.
HS2 also proposes to determine three options for the wide-ranging high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer to the spring.
The preferred option is to confiscate the form of the letter Y, when one high-speed track should lead to Western Midland.
The trail should be shared near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennsylvania to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that there has been the most effective choice," said the knower of the railways.
As soon as it's done, the driving time between London and Edinburgh will be short for two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow the traveler to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in attendance.
The proposals should allow trains to drive 2250 miles per hour, which would do the fastest in Europe from the British network.
The initial track is already designed to take trains in a length of 400 m that would be able to transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 matches could operate every hour on London - Birmingham track.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 200000 passengers if needed.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that existing stations would expand to include high-speed networks.
Railway industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not come before the general elections.
Even if he puts the car in motion, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service, not on high-speed tracks, but already on existing tracks north of Birmingham and keep traffic times between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered a decisive point of contact to ensure the transition from aircraft to train, a reference point for the revolution on the railway.
Taxpayers paid a mortgage of 75,000 pounds on Tory's Orange
Alan Duncan, the holder of the Tory's front seats in the MP's warehouse, paid the taxpayers thousands of pounds of costs last year for the orange he built in his home in the electoral district.
spokespersons for the prison, which was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the MPs lived "for the sakes", increased his mortgage to 75,000 pounds to build a deep-covered expansion in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to account for the special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month of taxpayers.
The public authorities approved the claims on time and thus were not heard by Sir Thomasen Legem, who carried out the control of the Member States' expenditures. Last night Mr Duncan said his requirements "it should be cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of Parliament's richest members, owns two two-storey houses for everyone in his roundabout Ruthland and Melton.
The houses have worth about a million pounds.
On the ground floor is a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the financial office has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added to the winter garden house, which is named "orangeria" in the plans.
The neighbors describe it as "a glass of fun and hospitality."
Mr Duncan was not requested to provide an explanation for the increased loan during the final check by the General Standards and Privilege Committee in the final settlement of the mortgage.
The committee informed him last month that he had violated the rules after reviewing his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the public security at the mortgage amounting to 271406 pounds from his property in London at the house in his election district, which he bought in 1991, year before becoming a member of the MP's cabinet.
The documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan called for about 1,400 pounds a month in the interest of the mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to over 1,800 pounds a month.
The interest of the RBS mortgages of Mr Duncan could not change at this time, indicating that it was all intended to finance a loan of 75000 pounds.
In December 2007, the standard exchange rate RBS decreased by 7.94 per cent to 4 per cent in March of this year, while it remained.
The final document of the general authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to charge 1250 pounds a month in May.
Mr Duncan left his job as a shadow leader at home in September after a secret reporter filmed it and said that the MPs must survive the expense scandal.
"In principle, it's national, you have to live for the benefit and it treats you like s**t."
He said: "I have lost my money for my garden, and my merchandise, and a little piece of bread, for what I needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't do it."
The envoy, a millionaire of the former career as an oil merchant, was first asked to explain his edition in May when it turned out that he had called for thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the approval of the financial authority, that it could be "considered excessive".
One of the activists dug it in the form of a librarian in Mr. Duncan's lawn for a protest after it was found that he claimed 4,000 pounds for a period of three years.
When asked last night to increase the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of the increase in capital, which was approved by both the financial authority, and then by the Law."
He added: "This is not a controversial question of hiding and clicking or breaking rules or anything else.
It's absolutely equal to the line down, according to the rules, and that's all.
It could not be many other ways cleaner or simpler."
All of you come to watch the chat on the brightton coast with the adventurous calendar.
Coastal chats in Brighton found new meaning in winter months as an interactive Advent Calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that stimulates the use of tobacco created 24 owners to win their chats for every day in December, and to use Christmas collections as the theme of this auction.
The event began on 1 December, when it allowed visitors to view the last chat from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and the Bishop bread and wine-flavoured, free of charge.
Selected colleges included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the chat represented the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, an assistant at television marketing from Howe, is a priest without scholarship in a chichester diocese and head of Beyondda.
He said, "We want to make religion much more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why do we as a church expect people to come to a foreign old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an exciting way.
"The idea of an adventurous calendar in chats arose as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and pulsating place and we've tried to try and present it in a spiritual way."
Strong mobilization in Kodana and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went to the street on Saturday with a requirement for an important and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodani, showed themselves around the world in Kodani, where hundreds of people were arrested by the police on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police sources, and one hundred thousand according to organizers, were in the cold weather in the Danish capital at the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt a Friday agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, said that the increasing global mobilization, with clear evidence of current manifestations, contributed to the fact that the "political tax" of possible failure in Kodana would be too high.
According to the AFP, incidents in the capital of Denmark occurred shortly after the birth of a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black began to break out the performances of the supplies and furniture.
The police immediately made a significant effort.
A total of 600 to 700 people were reported by the police and made it clear that they were members of "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical independent groups that had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, Eastern France.
Koalice Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the action, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without difference" and stressed that about a hundred were in the streets and in the seat "remained in the streets on Saturday night" and even through extreme winter.
After Parliament's resignation, the solution was in a calm direction towards the Bella Center, where the talks were held.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate inside.
For speakers, a podium was held before the spiritual meeting at the candles for the participation of the former South African archbishop of the Cape Town of Desmond Tutu.
Most protestors came by bus and train from large European cities and besides Africans, there were also a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue tiles, were created in the morning hours of the first assembly in Kodana and at the invitation of the Friends of the Earth group, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "righteous climate".
Today we go to the street to demand an environmental debt settlement in favour of the south, explained People Nacpil, a Philippine warrior from the Jubilee South Coalition in Kodani.
We can't say anymore: it's time for this to be announced by the benign singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and rivers dry, we can walk in them today, and it has never been possible before.
First, in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of combat for the rest of the world drew closer to environmental organisations.
French European Ambassador José Bové, one of the characters of the struggle for another world, said he came to Kodana with the aim of "committing climate and social justice". "At present there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific area, where there are many islands especially sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, there were about 50,000 people on the street according to organizers.
There were several hundred people in Manila, mostly students, dressed in red and with suits that evoked the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, hundreds of demonstrators went to the street demanding an important measure against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people, particularly in Paris, Marseilles (them), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyons (outside), participated in protests organised by the "350" button.
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia chose her president, Georgia condemns it as a "flash"
Abkhazia elected her president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent in Georgia, Tbilisi declared this step "fashka".
About 131000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 on control of the South Ossetia, which is another former Georgian territory, recognised by Russia.
The election rooms closed in 17h GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission, the participation was 58% a few hours before the closing of the elections.
The first preliminary results should be reported on Saturday night.
All five candidates, including the President-in-Office Sergei Bagapš, categorically reject the idea of joining Georgia, which condemned these elections.
These choices are a bottle.
On the other hand, Georgian President Michail Saakashvili "is sorry that Abkhazia has fallen completely into Russian domination," said his spokesman, Manana Manigaladze.
In addition to Russia, the independence of this territory was recognised by 216 000 people only in Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After the division from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, in which thousands of people were killed, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that she is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said the AFP Kvarčija Svetlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagapše.
She was one of those who came to the school’s selection room in the capital of Suchumi, to the beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of the Russian Government is the main theme of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea, which can be proud of its wonderful nature.
After all this small country with 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Bagaps are located next to Russian President Dmitrij Medvedeva and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gala, in the west of the country, the Russian officials who came to watch the successful course of the elections were waiting for a warm reception by the periodic archbishop of Beslan.
"We, Abkhaz, said gratefully" at a small ceremony, which meant supporting Moscow and, in particular, its decision to recognise Abkhaz independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, and added glass vodka to it.
The opposition, represented by former Vice-President Raul Khadzimbo and two merchants Zaus Ardzinbo and Beslan Boutbou, criticised contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a contract that enables Russia to control the network of Abkhazia for a period of 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current government or opposition.
A 50% plus one vote is necessary for winning the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive struggle shall take place within two weeks.
Climate: World events, events in Kodani
Tens of thousands of people went to the street on Saturday with a requirement for an important and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodani, showed themselves around the world in Kodani, where about 700 people were arrested by the police on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police sources, and one hundred thousand according to organizers, were held in the cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts up to 18 December 193 countries, on an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After Parliament's resignation, the solution was in a calm direction towards the Bella Center, where the talks were held.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate inside.
For speakers, a podium was held before the spiritual meeting at the candles for the participation of the former South African archbishop of the Cape Town of Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP journalist, incidents occurred shortly after the departure of the origin when a group of several set of demonstrators, dressed in black and armed bricks and furniture, began to break out the exhibits.
The police immediately surrounded them and struck them without waiting, and several demonstrators hit the ground.
A total of 600 to 700 people were reported by the police and made it clear that they were members of "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical independent groups that had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, Eastern France.
Later in the afternoon, one police officer was injured and four cars were burned near a squad located near the incident that resulted from police sources holding about 20 people.
We focus on extremist groups, warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while police helicopters flew back into the air.
Most of the protestors who arrived by bus or train from large German cities from London, Amsterdam and Milan were European origins.
But there were also many Asians, including several Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue plates were created in the morning hours in Kodani's first meeting on the challenge of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "righteous climate".
Today we go to the street to demand an environmental debt settlement in favour of the south, explained People Nacpil, a Philippine warrior from the Jubilee South Coalition in Kodani.
We can't say anymore: it's time for this to be announced by the benign singer Angelique Kidjo.

French European Ambassador José Bové, one of the characters of the struggle for another world, said he came to Kodana with the aim of "committing climate and social justice". "At present there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam has invited several well-known personalities, such as the Danish model Helen Christensen or former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, to speak to the davit.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific area, where there are many islands especially sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, there were about 50,000 people on the street according to organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly red-dressed students, were represented in front of the city council of the Philippines, with a series of events that highlighted the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, a number of hundreds of demonstrators also met with the requirement of an important action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people, particularly in Paris, Marseilles (them), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyons (outside), participated in protests organised by the "350" button.
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
The subjects of the Earth and the Scriptures will be strengthened within the framework of the reform of the general gymnasium, Chatel said.
The Minister of Education Luc Chatel stated on Sunday during a discussion on the JDD magazine that the articles of literature and geography will be "strengthened" in the framework of the reform of the general gymnasium, although their education will no longer be compulsory in the last year of the gymnasium with a focus on accurate science.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and for all, the same program from the general culture will be confirmed by Chatel.
According to the Minister, "it is necessary to end up with cover", because according to him, specialization S is no longer focused on accurate science" but "in essence they are the best students in it".
The specialisation of the EC and L cannot be for some sub-specializations, it continues and emphasizes: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would complain that in the last year of professional gymnasiums there is no geography and a history."
The study of the agency Ifop, published on Saturday by the Journal of Humanities, showed that seven French people from ten (69%) did not agree with the government's project to abolish compulsory writing and geography in the Mauritian Year with specialization S, and that was why many intellectuals and teachers criticised both the left and some Members of the right.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "there is no consideration" to abolish philosophy in the specialization programme S of the graduation year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended reform in teaching, while 16 organizations (students and committees) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against this project, which they considered to be a victim of pedagogical education for future professors of gymnasiums.
Under Master's 2 (M2) study, the Minister explained at the beginning of the annual acceptance test on their field and at the end of the year a further test on their ability to teach.
The participants will participate in the training courses during the second year of the Master's degree and the first year before the students will perform as professor-instachment.
If you count all the tracks that will be offered to you before the reception, you will have more experience with students, almost 300 hours, continued .
The Minister also announced that he would propose "personal right to education", which still does not exist in national education.
He confirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At the elite university of École normal superiors have 15 minutes to convince them about the climate.
Fifteen minutes for presenting the goals of the Codánsk Summit: this is the challenge announced in the Chamber in the morning by Jean Jouzel, a multi-president of the International Group of Climate Development Experts (GIEC) to promote the Ecole normal superiors on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist reported, the Nobel Prize for Peace Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conference, which is a one-day seminar composed of the fifteen-minute contributions of experts to be made and opened to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people, and based on what they should want to know more, he explained on the occasion of the 22-year-old Edward Hanneso conference, one of the organizers of this seminar, which was named according to the local lake fish named by the students.
Approximately 20 contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines are selected and clarified that selection is based on their charisma.
About warming the climate "we can talk about hours, but we can also reduce the basic targets in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before fifty listeners without pre-prepared notes, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that listeners will know that "codanese conference is based on very seriously prepared scientific bases".
The videos on these lectures will be posted on the school's web site from December 15.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February and the others will follow the schedule every two months.
Delay in payments: angry prison guards, planned measures
The Committees of Prison Observers announced "general mobilization" on Friday, as they demand that they be paid for the prize and the time that the salary has been deferred for financial reasons.
Prisoners' FO (2nd Committees of Supervisors) asked employees who would not have the service to participate in the demonstrations that took place in the morning before the prison facilities and to "block them" and thus to warn them of "the theft of their wages".
The CGT for Prison Supervisors (3nd Committees of this sector) called for "calling for meetings in individual prisons and for the initiation of fundamental mobilization" by "sudden and unacceptable" so that "time and pay for work at night, on Sundays and on holidays" prepared in October were not paid off in December.
First Committees of Supervisors, the Federal Union of Prison Observers (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for total mobilization (...) in order to show dissatisfaction and exacerbation".
The Executive Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes has increased considerably in 2009 and that not all were included in the financial budget, but ensures that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The office stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mariová sent a message to the prison supervisors to ensure that the payment would be made next month.
I know of the efforts made by prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the ministry writes in its communication.
I have ordered the managing director of the prison to take immediate measures to make sure that the situation, which arose with a poor estimate of the number of times, has never been re-evaluated in the future, added to the Ministry of Alliot-Mari.
Prosinc's salary will therefore be low, with the exception of the management staff who receive the famous award for the performance of the function and the achievement of the objectives, and for you "will always be in place in the budget".
It's just a scandal, the interregional FO Union in Marseille has been exacerbated and announced its decision to boycott the call for "all meetings and talks".
Employees will not come to work on Sundays or on holidays, unless payments for these days in October will be paid in December, as well as in the meantime, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also in danger.
At a time when we are given more work and more tasks without having other staff available to us, it is sad to allow them to pay for the lowest position of staff, says the CGT prison supervisors in Bordeaux.
According to the Committees, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are better than others.
However, in every case of financial resources because little, the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget, has found.
Both say he's giving "better gifts" for Christmas than he's getting
American President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, has entrusted Oprah Winfrey's "bohyni" screens with a simple rule regarding gifts: "I give better gifts than those I get."
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke in a special edition of the series, which will be broadcast on Sunday night at the ABC station about how they are going to celebrate their Christmas celebrations and the end of the year in their new and prestigious homes.
Even Bo, a small four-year-old family partner will get his granddaughter.
Jesus also likes Boa, said Michelle Obama, by saying that the dog will also receive a gift "of course" as it comes from the levels of the previous broadcast order.
And Michelle Obama also defended herself against her husband's insistence on the quality of gifts that she gets: "Of course not, I gave you the prime gifts last year," the president was offended.
Well, of course it's true, he was forced to agree with the president, but right after he showed his finger to the first lady's pearl necklace, "And who gave you this?"
In this one-hourly very relaxed series with the famous moderator who strongly supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, Obama's husband also spoke to Obama about their favorite gifts that they had received as children.
Barack Obama set up a ten-degree transfer, but also a basketball ball, which he devoted to his Kenyan father's Christmas, with only very rare encounters.
I remember seeing my father coming to see us on Christmas and giving me that basketball ball, the president told me.
Until a long time later, I realized that the ball actually gave it to me.
The first lady remembered the doll house again.
I didn't know how to organize everything in the house, so I fixed all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the blood, but the little house I loved for the ladies remembered Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday is again operated, RTL says he's in artificial sleep.
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles for the reason of the "injury" caused by the larger operation he performed in France, but the situation is according to his closest "under control", while the RTL station pointed out that the singer is in artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
66th-year-old rocker was again operated on the night from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found that "the injury arising from the operation" of the missing plates, which he spent in Paris on November 26th, informed his printing department in Paris that these lay required "correct operation".
However, the singer's press department tried to calm the public and stated that the situation was "under control" and at the same time announced that a new medical communication would be issued no later than 48 hours.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the last tour singer, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to prevent "disease and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens our eyes, we'll have a little bit more security, he adds RTL.
The press department did not confirm this information at the AFP's request.
RTL also states that, according to "some sources", no wood was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated at the international clinic Parc Monceau because of a hot plate.
The surgery, which was planned several days ago, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well-known in artistic circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday for RTL information.
After this operation, the singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for the infection that occurred after surgery.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallydaye, said on Thursday on the radio RTL that his friend was just going through a "bad period" but added that he was a rocker of "never-to-care", because it's a big "warner".
He called me right before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was stupid because spending 12 hours on the plane after that operation is no fun, Eddie Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, Jean-Claude Camus, who said that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well on antibiotics" and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said that he met Laeticia, a wife singer, and that he did not notice any special concerns.
The health problems of the singer have only been compounded since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to the surprise of all, it was discovered that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "small tumor of thin intestine" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his wedding.
But since then, each of his health problems has been very monitored and commented. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on the scene.
In mid-November, his team again had to detach the news of new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
France Frédérick Bousquet, a three-dimensional medalist for the world championship in 2009 in a large pool won a title for the 2009 European Championship in a small pool in Istanbul, which he particularly likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship, on which the last combinations are allowed, only three world records fell, although they were expected much more.
One of them beat the Hungarian race Evelyn Verrasztová to 200 m post race and two remaining Russian men's staff to 4x50 m post race.
A big scarf for Bousquet, who had taken a look at the world record in a 50 m free way, which is already the holder in the big pool (20,94).
In one of the two royal sailing disciplines, 50m free way, the 28-year-old French won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the finals, on which ten sailors were first launched instead of the usual eights.
Bousquet defeated Croatia Duje Draganja (20,70) and Russia Sergei Fesikova (20,84), but failed to overcome the world record (20,30), as he predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if there's a world record in my reach, I'll try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers had combinations made of polyurethane that would be prohibited from 1 January.
The combinations have helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ends in Istanbul, which is the first host in 1999 for the same competition.
The use of the combination this time did not help the Germans Paul Biedermann, a dual world champion in the great pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record for the reach of his hand.
The young swimmer failed to overcome the record, which holds 400 meters free (3:32.77), but won the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), in front of Russian racer Nikit Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in the race.
I knew that this time I didn't cross the world record, but I managed to cover up my title, and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: Romanian sarcophagus board belonging to Zolova was issued for $1.5 million
The board of the Roman sarcophagus, which was no different from the French writer Emil Zolov, was issued on Thursday for $1.5 million, which is significantly more than estimated, said a businessman with Sotheby's art.
The price of these two meters long and 63 cm high headboards, from the third century C.E., was estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
Marble "representing four dionysus scenes in a designed architectural decoration, surrounded by satires and bakchants is a rare work, similar pieces are very little in the world, perhaps four or five," AFP told Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's.
The work was sold among hundreds of others.
The sale is still going on, but it's the object that was probably the most attached, told the agency of the AFP spokesperson Sotheby's, Dan Abernthy.
The fact that Emile Zola had arranged this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The board was almost 300 years old in Rome in the famous Borgia family collection and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorelov, who recovered the bath in her private hotel in Paris and with Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic of France and the President of the Council shortly before the entry into power of the Petina.
It's been there for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz found in the search of the museum database in Louvre that this board was part of the "Residues of Emil Zoly" opened since 1903, a year after the death of author "Therese Raquin" and fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
A interrupted attempt to get President Zelay from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico concluded on Thursday that the conditions for the transport of the proposed President of Honduras, Manuel Zelayi, were not met, which the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure.
After the telephone conversation that I had with President Zelay at night, all the while he's hinting that there is no way to achieve this transport, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinos, has introduced.
The Mexican government aircraft, which flew to Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelay, flew back to the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The cleaning government wanted to bring President Zelay to "demisi" and to ask for political asylum abroad, only to allow him to leave safely.
But the proposed president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exile head of the state.
The government of the cleaners "have experienced further failures when she wanted me to give up my functions (...), they wanted me to give up the demos," said Zelaya Radio Globe on Thursday, where she often expresses herself to the political crisis that has lasted in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I've got my guitar here, I've been giving the proposed president, hidden at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpe for two and a half months, and he's been playing a couple of chords.
Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, Minister of the Interior of the Pure Government said on Wednesday, Oscar Raul Matute to HRN Honduran Radio.
I will not ask for asylum from any country, said Manuel Zelaya in a conversation for the Telesur station, which has a seat in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as President of the Honduras people, he stressed.
The news of Zelayi's departure was mobilized in the middle of the march of the President-in-Office, who came to gather around Brazil's embassy, where the army strengthened protection.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the state of the Puritan government.
They're showing their marginal attitude to international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who approached the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, was sentenced on 28 June, on the day he organised a public consultation in preparation for his re-election and against the recommendation of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica, he unexpectedly returned to the 21st century and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out of here, he'll be arrested and held responsible for the crime of the "vezzardy" from which he's accused, the Pustic government claims.
On 29 November, cleaner President Roberto Micheletti managed to organise presidential elections to replace President Zelayi.
In controversial elections recognised by the United States, but convicted by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil won Porfirio Lobo.
Three days later Congress voted against President Zelayi's return to power until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street's rising, US trade balance bids for optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with an increase and the results of the US trade balance testify to the rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to data from the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average has improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7,13 points to 2190.06 points.
Index Standard & Poor 500 has improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news from various parts of the economy, Lindsey Piegzová from FTN Financial commented.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focusing on half a full glass.
For Peter Cardillo from Avalon Partners, investors focus on US trade balance numbers, "which show that activity improves in the fourth quarter".
The trade deficit in the United States fell by 7.6% in October, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts were expecting a shift in the direction of growth.
There was an increase in both imports and exports.
A great news is the growing volume of trade, in particular the export of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell from the research company Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment was rising against all expectations and the number of jobseekers reached 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new entrants on employment "at the lowest in this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The market with valuable papers has also fallen.
The cost of the 10-year-old stock increase to 3,482% against 3,423% on Tuesday night and the profit to 30 flights increased to 4,492% against 4,408% the day before.
Cuba : hundreds of supporters of the regime said "Ladies in white"
A number of hundreds of supporters of the Cuban regime wrote on Thursday to the wife of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of the World Day of Human Rights and prevented further demonstrations on which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dam in White", a husband or close political prisoners were posted directly on the street by Raula Castra's supporters on their march towards the center of the capital, demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Away with Yankees!, "Golden!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" were reproached by the high footholds of the regime on dissidents.
The dissidents were finally escorted by civilians who came "safety".
The day before, there was a similar demonstration against "Dams in White" in Havana, but there was no injury or arrest.
But in the Havada district, about ten dissident police officers were detained in the civilian state, who were also going to protest on Thursday on the occasion of the World Day of Human Rights, the AFP journalist reported.
According to this reporter, the police imposed dissidents that had been drafted by government officials into civilian vehicles for the use of force.
The arrest of dissidents under similar conditions shall take only a few hours of the rule.
The holders of the 2005 European Parliament's Sacharov Prize, "Laura Pollanová", whose husband Héctor Maceda was sentenced to 20 years in prison, organised an unauthorized march for "dissenting all, according to the dissentence of about 200 political prisoners".
Mr. Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of which 53 are still on the net.
The Cuban authorities consider the resistance to "the hostages" or "the agents" paid by their criminal enemy, the United States.
A complete miracle, Cuban television reported a quarterly demonstration of the government regime's supporters against the "refuses of the revolution".
Cuba, with the Communist Party in its head and government policy, is regularly accused by European or American non-governmental organisations of disregarding human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
He killed an 18-year-old man with a knife and wounded five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A prostitute armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the time of the peak on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary findings of the investigation, the attacker at the age of 28 allegedly attacked two knives and for unknown reasons of the eighteen-year-old in or before the hospital, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
The heavily wounded old gentleman, born in 1929, died according to the Alliance police union in the hospital for the consequences of the injury.
In this medicine or before it, the attacker attacked the pregnant woman and her partner.
A husband in his 30 ’ s began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 18-year-old man died.
The life of a second injured person is in danger, according to police sources, likely to have been affected by vital organs.
The pregnant woman then rushed and was transferred to the hospital "in shock," the police source said.
The armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as the police source pointed out, then ran into the street, still on the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two more, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old, the second seriously.
As it all happened, it's not quite clear, because it all happened in the evening hours.
He was armed with two knives, carrying a cross behind his back, said at the location of the Alliance's leading union in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several traveling people, including young people, have tried to stop and defend themselves, according to the testimony of the AFP gathered.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green band.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on Alberto's situation, a clerk from a nearby bar.
He threw himself into the dust, including one of the city policemen who broke his belt.
Still at the Boulevard Jean-Jaures level 61, two police cities, including their leaders, tried to detain a armed man and were injured by the fists, the police source indicated.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
My colleagues came to tell me there's an injured person out there.
I went out and saw a seven-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe spot, and I noticed a big wound on my stomach, told the agent AFP Frederic Allione, a 30-five-year-old doctor.
Five minutes later, a second about three years later, a person who also had stabbing wounds with a knife.
A man who didn't have any IDs arrested after the state police.
The State Representative in Nanterre handed over the case to the National Police Department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was transferred to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody waiting for an inquiry.
The police source didn't exclude his location in psychiatric treatment.
Another police source stated that there was a need for six police officers to take him to a police station in Clicha, where he was transferred.
He was "all beyond himself" as "all the mad ones of this kind, whose power in action is increasing tenfold."
USA: Poland's lawyer again requests the termination of criminal proceedings
The lawyer of the Polish-French director Romana Polanski again requested on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, the West of the United States) to stop the criminal harassment against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence due to an anthrax that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the legal representative of the film director "Pianist" criticised three judges of the second-period appeal court in California, a serious mistake that occurred during the trial in 1977.
I demand that the appeal be suspended now and now, said lawyer Hummel, and added that from the conduct of the judge who then decided in the case, Laurence Rittenband "had a cold in his back."
According to him, a judge (who had already died) was supposed to act with a state representative who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – which is a serious violation of the rule of law.
Information on this interview was found in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and wanted" (Roman Polanski, sought and requested), from the mouth of the state representative, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally announced at the end of September that he lied to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Judge Hummel will require the execution of a court order in which he will be able to provide evidence of his claim.
The complainant reiterated what was already said in the first state, because there will be no serious examination of the request for suspension of criminal proceedings until Roman Polanski is brought before the court.
The 76th-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before the court ruled on "unlawful sexual intercourse" with an unfavourable girl at the age of 13.
Since then, he has never entered the United States again.
The prosecutor's deputy in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski "should be there to participate in the judicial recalculation".
We want to show in this case not only to the Polish Roman, but also to the other accused that it is possible to escape?
It is the view that the director "asks for favor and at the same time insults his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make a decision, also stressed that there are "other alternatives to escape".
Lawyer Hummel wasn't the only one who asked to stop Roman Polanski's criminal prosecution.
The victim's legal representative, Samantha Geimer, also again requested the termination of the criminal prosecution.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear the everlasting burden every time the Polanski case came out and added, "No one in this room can say that the trial was just".
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 February in Switzerland for order USA
After more than two months behind the grid, he was released to the house in his chaplain in Gstaad, where he waited for a possible demonstration.
Wall Street ends uninhabited, it's suspended by the rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without direction, the market shifts between indicators that were better than expected in the US at the rising dollar price: Dow Jones won +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the data from the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced from 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190,31 points.
Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very quiet, Mace Blackxilver from Marblehead Asset Management introduced.
It's still in a tight range, the volume of the trade has dropped very much, and I think it'll stay that way until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators, which were better than expected, and which "helped to improve the mood on the market in terms of stability of economic recovery," said analyst Charles Schwab.
In the United States, the retail market grew by 1.3% in November, and this is already the second month after itself and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index, the trust of American consumers also returned and grew to 73.4 versus 67.4 in December last month.
However, the indices have been hampered by a new increase in the dollar price against the euro, which is highest in the last two months, which "presses down the sector sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.
That's how technological action loses the ground under its feet.
The market with the precious papers is down.
The government's estimate for 10 years increased by 3,540% versus 3,482% on Wednesday night and by 30 years increased by 4,497% versus 4,492% on the previous day.
Miss World election again in the South African Republic.
After a month's journey across the South African Republic, 112 candidates under Miss World's title on Saturday are going to cross the target time to reach their dream: to be the most beautiful woman in the world before billions of TV viewers.
This great celebration of beauty has been held for the second year around Johannesburg, while five candidates have received a course in the semifinals.
Miss Japanese Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Maová from Canada were chosen during their African stay Miss sport or Miss top model.
It was a real faith of events.
It was wonderful to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things, and I have so many experiences!
The competition, which takes place in the South African Republic after the ninth, will be broadcast directly from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17 hours (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't figure out the more beautiful country I'd put my crown in.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm glad I could have enjoyed it twice, Miss Xenia Sukhin, in the hot southern summer.
For young Russians, her second stay in the South African Republic was carried out in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new appearance of the country and its "land that emits breath".
After months of performances, tests, meeting with the press and safari, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
Indka Poja Chopraová hopes that it will take place in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopraov, elected in 2000, who will also take part in Aishwarye Rai, the 1994 winners, who became two Bollywood stars.
To be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about sight.
We're in the mood of our countries, and I want to go home with the crown, says Miss Indie with a wide smile.
According to organizers, the 59th anniversary will be carried in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates are represented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The presentation will be presented by the Chinese TV moderator Angela Chow, former Queen of the beauty of the South African Republic Michelle McLean and the chairman of the board of Miss of the world Steve Douglas.
The South African Republic has shown that it is able to welcome the world with the heat that it is difficult to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of Miss World Competition.
The candidates, like last year, attended the safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on the bike, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was the meeting with South African President Jacob Zumou, who shook their hands.
For the unusual president, she met Miss Sierra Leone.
Without a doubt, the most beautiful memory will remain in Cape Town (in the south-west of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010 and which helped the country to support the event more.
I could have met people that I didn't even care about.
I'm sure I'm going back to the World Cup 2010, says with the enthusiasm of Miss Italia Alice Taticchiová.
According to David's son, Hallyday's status is "very positive".
News of Johnny Hallyday's condition is "very positive", as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at the airport in Los Angeles, where he flew to visit his father, who had been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday at the departure from the plane he flew from Paris at 13 a.m. local time (21 a.m. world time)
The son of the singer, who acted quietly, declared that he would be "as soon as possible" to the Los Angeles hospital Cedars-Sinaï, to whom John Hallyday was to be admitted on Monday due to the post-operative infection caused by the operation of the endangered inter-bratial platinum, which occurred on November 26th in Paris.
According to the press statement, the night was sung in Los Angeles for the reason of the convenience of "indicated to artificial sleep", which should prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor at Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles already referred to the art of sleep. Hospitalization was due to the infection after a severe inter-brat plates performed on 26 November in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this attack , the singer had to be re-operated at night from Wednesday to Thursday .
According to the photographer AFP, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance at the French school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, visiting their daughter Jade.
The leading department of orthopaedic surgery and traumatology hospital la Pitie-Salpétrière, Yves Catoné, announced that the singer to Los Angeles was flying off on Monday.
The producer strongly accused Dr. Stéphana Delajouxe, a neurosurgeon, who operated at the Clinique International du Parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
They told us it was a massacre.
The L.A. surgeons declared they were rebel, Mr. Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday went too fast to Los Angeles and allowed his Paris surgeon.
Personally, I spoke to my doctor on the phone and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me greatly, since I had suffered twice as much as an inter-bratial plate myself.
A few minutes earlier at the radio station RTL stated that the singer had apparently fled after the Paris operation without a drain, without anything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajaux is very well known in artistic circles.
He operated the actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he had been working on at that time.
In 2007, Charlotte Gainsbourg also operated on the hematoma that resulted from brain bleeding.
However, it is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times convicted in cases of neglect of medical care, tax evasion and fraud.
The medical chamber lawyer Olivier Metzner identified him as "a man without a scratch", which is "regularly" before the medical chamber, and which cannot be "recommended far away".
After several silences, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He announced that the move had "a very good course" and the post-operative investigation was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic, so it was not necessary to introduce the drain," he added.
The health problems of the singer since this year are growing and, in any case, it seems to remain with the questionnaire.
It is clear that the deadline for the renewal of the planned tour on January 8th (In Amiensa, p.
The UDF Association increases the tone and calls on the New Centre to keep it short.
The UDF association, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayroua, responded to the attempt of the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morina on the short-recognition of the former Giscard party by not using a short-term medium under the threat of criminal harassment.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to assign a short UDF with the fact that François Bayrou did not deserve to carry her heritage after he handed his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council for the Movement of the New Centre (NC).
This step was supported by Mrs Hervé de Charett (formerly za-UMP now NC) who subscribed to the ownership of the UDF brand, as she was the first to register at the National Institute of Industrial Property (I'Institut national de la propriété industrialelle) in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF-led friend Françoise Bayroua's committee, who did not intend to let himself get out of the way, made a formal request to the Minister and the MPs to stop using short and return the ownership of the security marks, under threat of criminal harassment.
In the last few days, you have raised concerns about proposing your political move + take over the short UDF, says the Association in your letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis from the Alliance of Centristers.
At the same time you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your moving name+Nouveau center+, with the slogan +UDF today+, you also find signatories of the letter.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this summary, explains the UDF committee, which requests the NC movement to remove any mention of the name of the UDF from all promotional materials including (its) websites."
At the same time, Hervé de Charette asks "to hand over the ownership of the trademarks to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we shall refer to the courts for compliance with the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, the signatories shall be informed.
In their letter it is stated that the UDF "is a full political movement in 1978" and recalls that Mr. Morin and his friends "elected" to leave in 2007, "to create a competitive movement, as well as others in 2002 to set up the UMP.
The new centre is therefore not entitled, according to them, to use a short UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, it is recalled that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to establish a committee of "moral and material interests" of a association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charettea, the committee continues "when he registered a trademark", not "for three years as a member of the UDF", but the UMP.
In a scandalous and subjugated way, he used non-existent acronyms registration to do so on his own account.
This inaction is becoming a criminal act, they declare, and then they say with irony to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that, both in politics and in the ordinary life, it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to emerge from anonymity by subjugated names on which we do not have the right."
The Liliane Bettencourt case : François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of the state of weakness.
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and to make a judgment on whether he used the state of weakness of eighteen billionaires to prepare her for part of her name, which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames her.
The photographer (62 years), known by his photographs of fame, will be sued on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of the state of weakness, which is a criminal offence for which the penalty is held for a maximum duration of 3 years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This Decision confirms that there is a real process in causation, which can be identified as a family story of one of the richest families in France in which the mother and daughter are attacked and is fighting for the control of the cosmic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th criminal court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be conducted by three doctors' college.
L'Oréal’s grandfather and principal shareholder has always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the state representatives in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time give an opinion on whether Liliana Bettencourt could be in a state of weakness and during what period.
I think she's going to get her.
I'll talk to her about it. After hearing Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kieiman.
As for lawyer Françoise Bettencourt-Mayers, Oliver Metzner, this decision was welcomed by the court.
It's an excellent report(...). The expert shows that with this old lady who needs protection, he manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
These are two years that Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter started a criminal trial against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and ally who is guilty of using her mother's disability for years to obtain a billion euro in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master's pictures.
Therefore, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer whom she considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the validity of the appeal brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Mayers, the court's Friday speech of lawyers changed at a time of family truth.
The lawyer Liliana Bettencourts submitted three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she expressed her distrust of his husband, François Bettencourt-Mayers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to the lawyer, adds: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years once to two times a day.
Ever since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise."
The State representation in Nanterre again found that the complainant's proceedings were not lawful, more than that the precautionary judge in those days rejected her application to initiate proceedings for the issue of legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully able to participate in court, is not under protection or custody.
No one else will act for her," confirmed the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that Mrs Bettencourt-Mayers' rights should be expressed at the time of the initiation of the proceedings.
The Manger Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence was unnecessary...
For more than ten years, the management of large companies has been reminded of the company's access to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is for employees to get in touch with the "values" set out in the mountain, as it was before, when consumers had to use products derived from the ideas of the head of manufacturing techniques.
By becoming the customer's centre of business, the marketing revolution compared the market acquisition strategy with the right direction...and when authoritarian efforts to use products other than customer preferences are regularly returning!
Passive access to employees can lead to fatal demobilization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only visible parts of a much wider global phenomenon, which involves mainly managerial frameworks.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and what is more important, economic intelligence.
And indeed, the EI "needs active access and predictability from all parties involved (...) and requires the employees of a commitment that is completely in conflict with the revenue of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution, which should be aimed at bringing workers into the company's centre of interest as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal public opinion research.
The internal public opinion polls - as an questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - contribute to the revolution in managerial procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Especially because I've already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure after different deviations will, in preference, return to what I've always done!
Furthermore, authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases considerably with the seriousness of its own failures.
And finally, because most management workers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of high schools for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of the convenience of thought, they are winning an old behaviorory theory, currently relived by the "neuroves" from the United States and widely expanded without greater knowledge of scientific institutions and the media.
With the possibility of moving "paks" (sic) the involvement of managers, he showed a recent survey by the agency Ipsos on the Figaro.fr pages, which only establishes management workers in their position of mechanical management that is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the management revolution is necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses, assuming the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It is included in the inclusion of the basic supervision in all the objectives and practices of the procedure : commitments to the enterprise for employees will only be possible if they appear as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the present time, this concept of employee motivation is only conducted in a study motivated by functional analysis.
These studies have shown that the evaluation of their businesses on the basis of pre-defined doxes, which enables them, through the image that they speak about, to assess what they offer to achieve their life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, management workers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and introduce their management of human resources "on the right path".
This creates a living ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
I'm saying from Oslo: "Just war" Obama earned his praise on the right.
U.S. rights on Friday welcomed the speech that Barack Obama presented the day before in Oslo, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize holder in 2009 defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who first laughed at Obama's award of the prize on 9 October, this time pressed for the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, former candidates to the Vice-President in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the museum of the right-wing Republican wing, for the U.S. Journal of Today, and added that it itself expressed itself on this subject "sometimes necessary" wars in its memories that are just coming out.
The war is, of course, the last thing the Americans would want to do, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to stay there, they think.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessorGeorge W. Bush, justified the deployment of forces in Oslo on Thursday and used his statement to explain his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days before that.
Another Obama's opponent, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very good, thank you for the former President of the Snow White House, who particularly appreciated the President's reference to "the existence of evil in the world".
In my own way, I considered this speech to be quite historical, Gingrich said during the interview in the series "The Takeaway".
The former MP, whom some consider to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential elections, was delighted to see the "leek president" remind members of the Nobel Prize Committee," that they themselves would not be free and would not be able to transfer the price for peace if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, former speech author George W. Bush, now editor of Washington Post, Obama presented "very American talk".
Not only did he represent himself as a "world citizen" as always, but he spoke as an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves, and that they didn't do too much to keep it," Gerson assessed.
A few of the right-wing dissatisfactions include the bushov era, an former ambassador at the United Nations John Bolton, who marked the talk as "unique, bold and uninhibited", as he pointed out on the National Review Online website.
Left of the President, for example, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is afraid of Barack Obama, as he justifies the use of force.
"When we throw the war into the package of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the medium-sized press stands in favour of the President.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider granting Obama's peace prize as an early one, he considered his performance as a "survivor" and also for a speaker known as his talent.
The talk from Oslo should serve as a guide to international decision-making in conflict resolution, in combating poverty and oppression," the California Journal states.
Obama's "showed what it was like," assessed the New York Times, and marked "for simplicity and instruction".
Road transporters: three marathons to an agreement that saves the supply of supplies on Christmas.
After the three marathons, road transport committees and TLF, the only organisation of employers that remained until the end of Friday evening came to an agreement that put an end to the challenge to the stand and the threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, at the Friday signing of the agreement, expressed "rejoice" after several negotiations that began in the middle of the morning.
After the second night of the discussion, the negotiators split up early in the morning, hoping that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
Even though three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTR) have resigned from the process.
But there was a need for more than six hours of meeting, which began in 11 hours, to all agree and in 18 hours of signing the agreement.
This conflict "would hurt businesses a lot" and "dangerous that the holidays would be disrupted at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text includes an increase of 4% in wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% in the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest wages is increased from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but it's a lot of effort, Patrick Clos explained.
Tonight, we will give our members a command not to allow lockdowns, no lockdowns of the supply centres.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "correct agreement", even though it was difficult to admit an increase in high wages due to international competition."
According to it, an increase of 170 euros per month in the lowest forest and between 100 and 120 euros per month in the highest.
It is a healthy agreement and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Doine (CFTC) welcomed the "historical agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for a revalidation of travel expenses of 3% and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also focus on the issue of payment 13 and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "a reduction of EUR 100 million in corporate wages tax" which was the subject of a draft government amendment to the 2009 Budget Act, which was voted on at night from Thursday to Friday at the National Assembly.
The government is asking the Senate for a "good" vote.
The signature enables this agreement to be applied firstly to companies which are members of this organisation, later on to the whole sector, in the case of enlargement of the Ministry of Labour.
Achieving "as short as possible", Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only exacerbate the disagreement between employers' organisations.
The FNTR is talking about "bad trade" because 100 million euros "have already been offered to the sector in the context of compensation for part of the carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport has forced us to do the necessary work, not as a result of mutual analysis, but because of the fact that he did not discern the roots of the coming Christmas celebrations, Unostra complained.
For the organization Other, the agreement "will bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector in the next 12 months".
Home trains RER A: suspension of the weekend transport, committees unhappy with the proposals of the RATP transport company.
The interruption of the transport on the line of the RER A urban trains, which is the largest line of urban public transport in France, will continue during the weekend, as Friday's discussions between the committees and the administration of RATP on the second day of the station did not lead to any specific results in the question of the premium.
On Saturdays and Sundays, then on days of important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will drive only between 10 and 20 hours, on the main section (between La Défense and Nation) will drive every other train, except this section only one train from four.
The connection with SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will thus be forced to switch to another train.
The business houses of Galeries Lafayette, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP sought to secure a connection with large business houses".
Link RER A leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
Rusek managed RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, there was in operation one train from two and practically no compound was out of place at the time, as was the plan.
As on Thursday, the people of Ile de France were different and there was no confusion in the performances.
So early in the morning, there were a lot less people at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) than usual, but also because of the lack of students and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he was up about a "hour and a half ago to make sure he's in time."
The Saint-Lazare Station was not overcrowded, SNCF State Railways announced, and a larger number of founders and guards were predicted.
The local RER A SNCF trains in the direction of or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut came or departed from the Saint-Lazare Station with a subway connection.
Further important meetings will be held on Saturday and Sundays, on which the results of the Friday afternoon meeting will be evaluated by the committees as "weak".
The management of RER proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A inland waterways on all sides, changes in working hours, careers etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand a prize, according to Thierry Garon (Jih Board).
The RATP has even put down proposals for the premium, which worsened the CGT by "not being able to solve the problem while the road hauliers and SNCF were doing it".
At a new meeting, which is scheduled on Monday, "the conditions for the performance of the call are closer to being reviewed", RATP clarified.
Which was why the experts think the company is "making out of weekend traveling fun".
In the morning hours, about 150 drivers were stationed by a business committee in his Paris headquarters.
The management, which has so far refused any discussion during the event, therefore decided to meet in the interest of "cooling".
The danger is that the conflict will expand on the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independent will announce the emergency.
The Committees apply for a premium of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jh), Independents (Independence)) and are concerned with worsening working conditions on this line, which transports millions of passengers daily.
The RER city train drivers make up an advanced career of 2200 to 2700 euros gross wages and 600 to 650 euros for irregular working hours and for Sunday work and for holidays.
The Turkish court has dissolved for the Kurdish side and this decision is bearing heavy consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to abolish the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately triggered protests in the Kurdish community in the south-eastern country and Istanbul.
This decision can significantly complicate the government's task, which is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and thus try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society's (DTP) side was dissolved because it became "a consequence of activities threatening the independence of the State and its indivisible units," the President of the Supreme Court Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was unanimously adopted by 11 judges, when the majority-seven votes were needed for the party's dissolution, Kilic stated that 37 party camps, including its President Ahmet Turk and MEP Aysely Tugluková, were prohibited from participating in political life for a period of five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Turk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the property of the party to the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP site has 21 chairs in Parliament (of 500).
The party's leadership had already pointed out before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political competence in it.
The decision is to continue the trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses DTP of being "obligatory" to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organisation.
Many observers are convinced that DTP is the legal political vitro of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures that there is no "basic connection" with the PKK, but refuses to mark it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to limit Kurd's support to the PKK and end such a conflict.
The DTP has confirmed that the party's dissolution could lead to the restoration of tensions in the south-east of Anatolia, where in recent weeks there has been a lot of demonstrations against the conditions under which the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is held in custody with the police.
Since the notification of the justice decision, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large town in the south-east, which is predominantly Kurdish.
The police used tear grenades and waterworks, demonstrators threw back Molot's cocktails or shot rocks from the dust.
In Istanbul too, about a hundred people showed up.
After the verdict was delivered, Mr. Türk stated that the decision of justice would only be "deep sorrow".
Turkey cannot resolve this question (Kurdów, known as the Order) by banning the party, he said in the press.
The government, created by the party from the Islamic movement, also condemned this decision.
We're from the principles against breaking the side.
It's okay, Taner Yildiz's energy minister.
This decision was a simple reflection of the democratic proposals launched by the government by Politologist Ahmet Insel.
Of course we can wait for the PKK's response, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK reported on one of the most deadly attacks on the north of Turkey, which killed in three days earlier seven soldiers.
Snow can come
Nice cold winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to blackmail the citizens, says the head of the FES’s Winter Department of Technical Services.
But that's why his employees can try and learn to control all the driving techniques.
It could be the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
It is prepared over 300 employees and 120 vehicles to take care of snow and ice.
However, the FES is acting in accordance with the exact plan.
Once snows in Frankfurt, and temperatures fall below zero, they will go to 20 so-called sections, and in a large way, explains Brauburger.
These sections include the main and transit trails such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, urban public transport lines, walking zones and sections with falling like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning.
In case of need, it is necessary for a maximum of three hours to absorb a moisture salt which is better kept, some 100 miles [1040 km].
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "to make the roads free when transport to work begins."
It's not easy when it starts snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter department of technical services, "because no one is willing to make a place for the security guards."
Only when it's not so snowy are there a number of incoming and connecting communications, which also include Rat-Beil-Strasse.
The final priority is sideways and sideways.
Brauburger knows they're going to complain.
In the morning, the FES pedestrians will be on their way, mainly to clean up dangerous places and crossings.
Most FES cannot take care of all cyclists.
In Frankfurt there is a special service that monitors from 22 to 4.30 bridges in particular, says Brauburger.
As the ice is rapidly formed on them, it will run out as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, they will also be called by the police.
Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other massive dinosaurs: the animal was two meters long and 1.50 meters high after two strong rear limbs, had a protruding skull with sharp, bent teeth, short front limbs with slender legs and long tails.
If this species lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the fourth edition of Science magazine writes that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body signs.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which was then located in a dry area of the Pangea supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window for the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the relationship, the enlargement and the significant early dinosaurs.
In 2006 Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day we found dozens of dinosaur bones, which is unknown to the trias, a member of the Randall Irmis team from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones identified scientists quickly as a new species.
During the excavation, the remains were collected with a total of five units.
The findings confirm the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Indians, Hopi.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an unusual finding: "The fossils of dinosaurs from the triasis are very rare, most of them will find only single fragments."
Other dinosaurs don't share this enthusiasm without a guarantee.
Especially sensational is not this finding, but it confirms some theory of early dinosaur history, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the allocation of pradinosaur is mostly controversial.
The experts discuss, for example, when the hunters were divided into three major development lines: the mass-fueled thermopods, which later belonged to the Tyranosaurus rég, Velociraptor and also birds, the "long-term" four-storey auropods and their relatives, and the beekeepers of the Ornithischia (ptacopan) to which they belonged, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is the original therapist after the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
At the base of Tawa Hallae, researchers found, for example, evidence of airquakes that also have the offspring of the terapods of birds.
Air vacuums make the breathing of birds more effective than the frogs.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the rats were obviously filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive thermopod with air vacuums, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of huge auropods also later had air vacuums and light bones, this useful innovation has probably created a common precedent for both groups.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs in South America have known so far, scientists have been able to say that the cavemen first appeared there.
According to this, three development lines were divided early and extended from South America to all continents, which then formed a single terrestrial mass as the Pangea supercontinent.
She would also talk about the fact that the team found the remains of two others with Tawa, especially close relatives.
These three can't come from a common, immigrant ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe that there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of a scientific study.
Of course, there are also disagreements.
One even older species, Silesaurus, a group of the hardest dinosaurs, lived in Poland today, says Bonnon paleontologist Martin Sander.
His view could give a picture together, because in South America there remained very many primitive fossils of dinosaurs, and on other continents there are rare times.
As dinosaurs have proved, from a relatively rare sideline of the plazas, they have developed into the country’s dominant turning point in the Middle Ages, it remains a struggle.
During the triasse, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other beaches, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lobsters and countless other lobsters.
At the end of the tribulation, dinosaurs spread throughout the world and developed many new species, while relatives died and the expansion of the tribulation and jury.
A History of Success Has Not Lasted Forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
It could have come to mass measurement, which dinosaurs had survived by chance, but not the beach.
Or the dinosaurs got better, so they could push out competition.
The history of success did not last forever.
About 150 million years later, another group of animals that had developed into a triasso and lived in the shadow since then.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors at University Toronto, University of Cambridge, Vienna University or Berkeley in California.
The students from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin, or Brém joined.
The police clearance of the frenchfurt casino of Goethe University was a worldwide riot.
278 teachers and teachers at Goeth University, but also high schools throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarity with Protestant students at the Westend campus.
In a statement written by German and English "not approved" by the president of the police force.
Because the walls and the works of art were painted, the university president Werner Müller-Estler allowed the building to be cleaned, which was occupied last week by the attending students and lecturers.
At the time, five students were injured.
Damages to matters, judges signatories, do not justify "the violent release of self-organized student training and teaching police officers".
Clearance is an "inadmissible intervention" in freedom of research and science.
The exceptional focus on vandalism is on "injustice and criminalisation of protests" and draws attention to the contents.
The Bureau avoided the necessary discussion.
The rapporteurs call for the suspension of criminal proceedings.
It is claimed that most interns did not support material injury.
Authorised protest
Young members of the Verdi and the German Association of Committees also work together with students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about its own future, says the Secret Earth Youths of Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hessen Ministry of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has so far challenged the procedure of the university president and police.
We're grateful to the university president.
The elimination and storage are totally unacceptable, said on Thursday in the Current Hour (Current Hour) in the Wiesbaden Land Snow.
We have an understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, the MP said on the ground floor for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise they saw the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Links.
The CDU is taking a slow wall behind the lock to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Links).
Instead of addressing the arguments and requirements of the students, there was a clearance.
Linke made a proposal that calls for the Minister to report on the police situation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was a secret town, not available to visitors from the west.
Greenegrad, one of the ten periods of Moscow’s capital, in the Soviet Union, was a closely guarded site where a secret military research was carried out.
Today, this period is considered to be 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow Centre, for "Russian Silicon Valley".
The main micro- and nano-electronic research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, Green City representatives have contacted the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been several mutual visits and on Wednesday they signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation led the Moscow mayor Jury Rosljak and Prefect of the Zelenograd Anatoli Smirnov, signed for Frankfurt the lead planning rapporteur Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, FIZ representatives and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will go to a seminar in Greengrad.
Scientific exchange
It's a continuous scientific exchange.
It's also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to catch themselves on a growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies are looking for orders in Germany.
Greenegrad is the home of major Russian research institutions and companies.
These include the Moscow Electronics Institute, the large Sitronics and the Russian Electronics Group.
The band was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Greenegrad (a literal translation of "Green City") received its name according to the forested hilly landscape into which research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension can't be prepared enough.
For the project's beneficiaries, it is quite simply about the "new heart of Europe".
S21 is more than the launch of the station, more than a monster building, which will throw the capital of Bádenska-Württemberg for one decade into the desperate building chaos.
Stuttgart was born in the spirit of the '80s.
The main stations with trains that ended in the center of the city were then considered transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as brakes of modern rail transport, as it took an enormous amount of time to cross the locomotives behind the front.
Take a moment to stop, go on - so it should work.
And that's why he's leaving the main station: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transitional station, which lies almost half the route of trans-European railway magistrates between Paris and Budapest/Bratislav - that is why the slogan about "the heart of Europe".
It actually starts with S21, although the 80-year-old vision is no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves knew that the start of the building was almost unfunded in Hessen and Bavarian capital.
Since there are modern cyclone trains with motor and driving vehicles on both ends, the main station has no problem with driving and driving.
However: Stuttgart begins 21 including new ICE routes to Ulma.
They've driven the land and the municipal policy.
The routes work together because the risk of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic is borne by the taxpayer and not by the state group.
Urbanists can excuse the project in some other way.
It will create a new city space that, if we believe in computer images of designers, will contain a lot of green.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
Transitional station and track construction are intended for personal transport, which - typically in the 1980s - attributed enormous growth.
There was no competition for cheap flights at the time.
Modern transport policies have to go, however, first of all, to strengthen freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than road freight.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to a steep climb.
More serious is that S21 directly affects many other railway projects.
In Switzerland, six billion euros were to be buried.
That's an official number.
Experts consider the real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade, there will be a lack of funding for other cutting points and tight spots on the network.
There are sixty larger projects on the list of transport ministries.
One of the most important is the construction of approximately 180 km long roads along the Rhine.
Since 1987 it has been on this route at a slow pace.
There's a lot of pressure in here.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The trail of Rina will become the backdrop of international freight transport: directly in the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the judgment on the airport
The Land Government has kept open in the Wiesbaden Land Snow if it goes against the judgment of the Hessen Administrative Court (VGH) on the prohibition of night flights and allows it to be reviewed.
The CDU/FDP Coalitions have entrusted experts with legal review of more than 400-page VGH judgements, said the Minister of Economics Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassel today in writing argued that in the case of a construction planned for the north-west injury of the Frankfurt airport, the state would have to adjust the night ban again.
The 17-year permit between 23 and 5 hours, as proposed by the Dutch Government, does not comply with the law on the protection of the population from night noise.
The brakes shall be decided by 4 January if they require a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticised this postponement and appealed to the representative of the government to reject the revision of the Spolkov Administrative Court in Lipsk.
The head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel group called for the CDU and FDP to return to the promises regarding the ban on night flights that she made before the election. Otherwise, it is possible to evaluate it as a "derogation of the word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, said the Chief of Green Tarek Al-Wazir in violation of the FDP "We hold the word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbela's promotion, the Dutch government is trying to get to its night flights through "transgression of rights and tricks".
Right legal control needs time.
Coalitions don't want to work on the basis of "fast first impression".
We need a realistic decision, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
His rulings against night flights have never been the way he opposes them.
American Banks Paying Aid
American, crisis-stricken big banks are getting rid of state flights.
The Bank of America paid a loan on average from the Tarp Bank Savings Fund for a total of 45 billion dollars (about EUR 30 billion).
According to the report, CNBC is planning to pay State aid to Citigroup as well.
The constitutions thus want to avoid the restriction that money has been accepted - the limitation of the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America has made $19 billion of money available to investors through variable bonds.
The remainder of the amount was taken from its deposit, which was filled out, inter alia, through the sales of the committee.
The bank manager Kenneth Lewis thanked the U.S. taxpayer on Wednesday night: Money injections helped us to overcome a difficult time.
The monetary institution has damaged the top financial crisis by taking over the Merrill Lynch Investment Bank.
Citigroup wants to get rid of its obligations to the State by also making money on the capital market.
The CNBC reported that this US bank had already been able to announce a capital increase of about $20 billion on Thursday.
The spokesperson Citigroup didn't want to express himself.
In June they paid assistance already Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
It just went faster than expected.
The station only represented the successor two weeks after the ZDF's Board of Directors was expelled from the office of Chief Editor Nikolaus Brender.
Last night, the cream wanted to agree on that person.
Peter Frey, a leading ZDF student in the capital of Berlin, was named for the favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially, so it wouldn't prevent the process.
However, the role could also be played by the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF's agent Markus Schächter if this proposal did not go through with the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the jury.
The result of the vote was unknown before the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago he crashed into the Schächter Board with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
For Brender, only seven members voted against him. Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although it was expected.
The majority of the Union in the Governing Council had already signaled several weeks before the elections that it did not want to confirm Brender in the office.
Hesen Prime Minister Roland Koch organized resistance to the chief editor.
He rejected further disturbances in the office of the highly respected chief editor on the argument that Brender's monitoring of the ZDF's transmission was reduced.
So until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence of the ZDF was strongly criticised.
Finally, the debate included even 35 state lawmakers who consider the Koch process to be counter-constitutional.
It wasn't about anything.
About Person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy, and romance.
Then he worked for the Southwest Funk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey went to ZDF, first to the today-journal.
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur; 1991/92 writer in Washington; leading and moderator "Morgenmagazines"; leading foreign policy ZDF until 2001; since then leading the main study of ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected on Wednesday by the media magazine magazine, met, Greenie was informed that they had filed a constitutional complaint.
Love's opposition to the Governing Council, Rynko-Falk Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the sex countries should change the state agreement with the ZDF so that the personal proposals of the intent cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude the foreign policies from the ZDF Supervisory Board.
Brender's alleged successor, Peter Frey, advised the board of directors with smart chess keyboards - immediately after Brender's meeting, he criticised for this severe crime.
As a result of this evidence of journalistic independence, he could nominate him as the chief editor without losing face like Schächter, so he could be elected by the board without becoming suspicious that the party would be pushed to the office.
In the lateral arithmetic, Frey is so many of the left-wing liberals.
Study Freed From Harampads
Part of the success for students: After the year of the event, the ministers of culture finally took part in the conference on Thursdays to the countries of scholastic culture: at the Conference of Ministers of Culture and University Rectors, both parties agreed that it would be desirable to improve the study conditions for bakers and magistrates.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of testing: Basically, each study module should end with a single test.
In addition, the workload of students should be over-checked, and "real and protective measures" should be ensured.
Politicians and high schools want to simplify the recognition of tests between high schools in Germany and abroad.
The country of origin undertakes to create more flexible common structural tasks for the bacterial and master study sectors.
Earthquakes should cease to exist.
Less Tests
Since the beginning of student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have had round words about a better study.
Now they're first filled with specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Council has found that the number of tests is reduced by drasticly: "Every module will just finish only one test", a 30-page report which is intended to regulate, in part, the approval of the study sectors.
"Early lower test load," said Reinhold Grimm, president of the Accreditation Council, "is to be stopped a misdevelopment that significantly limited the scope of the study."
To this end, the "research" will be in the future "deciding criteria" in implementation.
Modules and contents must be "hard to control", in order not to "absolutely limit students in choice
Seminars."
Students should "be able to access space that enables and supports their own initiative".
The rules are to be applied when approving new study boards, after examination, but also for existing study boards.
You need to "recredit" every five years – however, it means it will take until 2015 before all the study sectors are over-controlled.
This is the responsibility of Germany as a whole for the ten accreditation agencies that are subject to accreditation councils established by the co-sponsored countries.
In October, the Ministry of Culture called on the "significant" social countries to act on the agencies so that the full learning system would not be too large and the test regime would not be strict.
In each country, universities and universities have already agreed with the national ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country has so far pledged additional resources for further development of the Bologna Process.
In particular, high schools should build consultation programmes and study advice, and strengthen pilot and foreign authorities.
This is what countries and high schools want to spend ten million euros on it.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to bring a new law to parliament.
According to it, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
The training of the study should be even more flexible, and it should be ensured that tests from other high schools are recognised and that the access of the master is facilitated.
By the end of the following year, all field studies in the country should be monitored.
The government and opposition again discussed the country's study conditions on Thursday.
There was also a criticism of the resolution.
The community's representation of the high school groups has called for the creation of education policy not to be played in the future by the "closed doors" of ministers and the school principals.
At the latest after the event, "at least a word should be spoken" also students as interested persons.
The future academics also received support from the President of the Conference of High School Rectors (HRK), Margrety Wintermantel: "We need students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with which the HRK discussed a joint reform report.
According to the Committees on Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution did not go far enough: They require a legal order that would allow each graduate with a baccalary title to have access to the building master's study.
Secondly, the social countries have to ensure that for today's generation of students in the bacterial field there will be enough places available in the Master's study camps tomorrow, with the best study conditions, said a member of GEW Andreas Keller.
The countries of the Community must employ far more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their free access to Master's programmes.
More than a note under the spell to Hert Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." the opening line of one poet, Werner Söllner, who is the subject of the experience of a dissident who has gained freedom, at the same time, has come about his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Romanian Banát, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer of one of the children’s bookstores, then moved to Frankfurt nad Mohan in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary prizes, 1993 presented poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hesense Literature Forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A significant microliterary explosion took place last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, where it was about "German literature in Romania in mirror and broken mirror of its security acts".
Obviously, the corrupt and infected Söllner has left a statement in which Romanian German writers Richard Wagner, William Totoke, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer admit to co-operation as a secret informant of the Romanian Secret Service Security.
Together with some of the present, Söllner received the German language price in 1989.
The recruitment attempts began unexpectedly, first in 1971.
I'm, I'm going to Söllner, "then someone who didn't resist enough attempts to scare the security."
Werner Söllner is secret agent Walter.
At the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller's and its unprecedented literary arrangement with the dictatorial government's mechanisms, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is struck by a case that denotes the depth and deplorability of the political system, which is based on control and speculation.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the state of knowledge today, only the perpetrator, but also the victim.
In the acts of Security, secret agent Walter played a role, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel and pointed to the positive effect of secret agent Walter.
"He cut me off" then in all the essential points for him, says Markel.
I have a moral obligation to make this note.
Söllner's statement was in this form and before this audience was unexpected, but it is simply a surprising confession of the former disident and his cooperation with Romanian secret service.
Herta Müller wrote already in July when she read her own papers, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the security mirrors.
Touching, it can be assumed, speculated, and in some cases even know what name is hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voic and also Walter.
Unlike in the country, in the meantime, a very certain look at the contents of the Stasi, manipulation with the rest of the security control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic enlightenment has been measured and limited.
One of Birthler’s offices, which is responsible for the National Security Council (CNSAS), was established only in 1999, the issue of an act has taken place more recently since that time.
Only since 2005 is there a law governing the management of files.
The fact that former Security members still have a great influence in Romania, after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller's talk, in which one of the former Chiefs of Security from Temešvár expressed his rejection of the rating holder.
He's a psychopath. He's been interrogated only once.
The subjugation of power was expressed here completely in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, in the case of Söllner, as in the case of a silent offence, there are inevitable questions.
Why so far? Who's hurt? The special reaction of listeners to Söllner's confession is to expect that the continuation of this chapter will determine more thirst for knowledge than after the binding of wine and the cold.
To the genius of Herty Müller, who accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, it's more than a note under the spell.
Filled deposit Champions League
It seemed as if a purely dressed trade representative came from a delicious Christmas party, on which the manufacturer of the sport goods of sweetness was released when he arrived a quarter of an hour after midnight in the invited mercedess class C new coach VfBr Christian Gross in the course of the orange coloured bag of sponsors.
A man with a marcant danced because of it let him drive away another town.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk luck was a 55-year-old, too.
It was a nice evening, but tomorrow he'll be going to work.
Or it's just starting.
The words only three days committed by Switzerland: "We have reached the eighth level," because in the Champions League thanks to the victory3:1 over Uniera Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be overcome by success: it will be a brutally hard fight against interference."
"A far more important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat in Mohuči the performance of the royal class and on the usual lig days.
And prevent the repeated obvious weaknesses after three rapid peaks of Marice (5), Träsche (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Disposal
Osmiffinále Champions League (cut 16/17. + 23/24 February/ lawyer cut 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's pressing performance will thus remain maintained.
Not only did the alleged doctor who added to the non-Suttgart professionals during a short time of self-consciousness, the desire to settle and the joy of the game.
I went to the players and told them that they should focus on their strong pages and I urged them to be more courageous, explained the doctor of the soul Gross so simply knowing a successful recipe that but for the treatment of Babbel he did not prove but no more effectiveness.
He blew up some magic, admitted Babbel's proponent Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in the football, things happen sometimes that you don't consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after several weeks of being injured, became the best player in the game because of his dynamics, tried to describe the discovered "phenomen" with the word "dark wind" and the workings of the new superintendent: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Babbel obviously missed it.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, sports president Horst Heldt warns
VfB Stuttgart needs more stamina.
As Gross, the players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against a weakened replacement and a completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would also win in Glasgow before a severe awakening after defeat 0:4 in Leverkus, Khedira considers.
And sports president Horst Heltt recalled that although one goal has been achieved in the season, the other one is still far away.
We're not out of water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after the first domestic victory after three months, was caused by the weekend events that were freshly revived in the form of a television conversation with the marketer Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
It's a decision that makes other people, not Jens, that brought Heldt up on Lehmann's hard criticism.
He was ahead of the image of poor leadership and decided to change the trainers after the pressure of the Pubertal Fans.
And the fact that he was abolished his day off after the battles marked Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and addiction.
Lehman's statements "formulates pure selfishness", Heltt reported on the consequences for the marketer.
Both of them will have no more joy in life.
In any case, they are at the same time with others that, without the work of a trained team, it would not be possible to play so powerful and warlike performances.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great deal of success," says Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and a man with an igelite bag agrees.
Fighting the world’s championships in a difficult way
Your duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the world's champion Vitalie Click.
After twelve hard wheels, however, the Ukrainian had won its title in a heavy weight of the WBC boxing organization.
The verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitaly Click remains the world's champion in the box in a difficult vase.
38-year-old WBC champion won the night on Saturday in Bern American Kevin Johnson unanimously on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Click it is the third successful title defense after his return in October 2008.
Previously, Ukraine was the world's champion of WBO and WBC twice.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen that everyone expected.
The click improved its balance of 39 wins in 41 professional contests, twice as a result of injury.
The challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese arena drove 2,02 meters high Click the match above all to their left.
About 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced before duel the end of Klík's era, but reached before the impact of the world's master, so Kliko couldn't fix the decisive impact on his dangerous line.
All he did was make a passive Johnson on the challenger a little bit, and he was just trying to get to the next round.
The call, however, provoked words and gestures, but his blows, but the world's champion of threfiles, only a few times.
But it's just the second boxer after Tim Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Klikke for 12 rounds.
The challenger took care of himself before the battle in the Swiss capital for a riot.
He attacked the Click as a "responsive zombie" that "can't do anything right".
During Friday's weighing, the champion let himself be provoked, pulled Johnson out of the nose of the sunglasses, "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth Victory after Click return
The click remained intact after the fourth match after its return on 11 October 2008.
After nearly four years, he defeated in Berlin, Nigeria, Samuel Peter, and took back his WBC belt, which had to be delivered without a fight before.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Areola from the United States in September.
In this battle, I got only one wound and physically in good shape, explained the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world's champion of WBO and IBF.
But the WBA's dog is wearing the Brit David Haye, after he sat on a 2,13-foot throne in November of the high Nikolai Vuljev.
Haye refused the battle against the Click, which was scheduled for September.
It is supposed to be planned by his promotional company to fight Klickov at the London Wembley Stadium.
Case Kundúz
The main attack from the opposition: Chief of the Greens Jürgen Trittin's Group marked for bad information about the Kundúz affair as the minister of defence of Guttenberg for the lie.
SPD and Links (Levice) invite an office to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge of Kundúz's flight, the opposition is believed to have allowed the defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) to be deliberately misled.
The minister for the deadly bombing of two tanks in September said "consciously false," said the leader of the Green Jürgen Trittin group in the Saturday news series ARD "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual expression: Lhal.
The death order was issued in the event of non-compliance with the rules of the International Security Support Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the message that NATO had read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday it appeared that the attack was not just about the destruction of stolen cargo cars, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the United States flight, which the German commander Kunduzu, Colonel Klein, requested, the NATO investigation found that up to 142 people were killed or injured.
Greenie, SPD and Linke called on her social office Angel Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express themselves immediately in front of the Spolkov Snow and also explained what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkelová has to explain whether the strategy for the killing of members of the Afghan Policy of the Spolkov Snow - and whether the Office of the Chancellor, Bundeswehr and the intelligence service approved this new strategy, called for Jürgen Trittin and colleagues from Green Renate Kunastová.
Ulrich Wilhelm's speech has certainly rejected criticism.
The Office of the Office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, too, there was a raise of doubts about the position of the ministry on the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs were informed correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tanks.
It was officially announced that they should deny the existence of NATO reports and shut down the Minister's sensitive details.
However, both top officials reported that they even warned the Ministry of Defence of a number of reports, between them on the two-page document of Colonel Klein and on one report of the military police.
Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sontagszeitung reports that Wichert should, in the meantime, request in a letter explaining the situation.
It is noted that he has not received an answer so far.
The Ministry did not make a statement on Saturday and pointed out that this would be resolved in the Spolkova Snow Investigation Committee, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some may see in their wake the image and hear voices that others do not see and do not hear.
Not only psychologically ill or in the drug chain are the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it's in bed, everything's fine.
If we lie closed in our dark room, we may be surrounded by the most wild imaginations and fantasy superstitions.
However, those who experience the anxiety of dreaming, seeing, and hearing things that others do not see and hear, pay most in the Western world for their folly or drug addiction, or at least as a surprise.
However, such images and voices are not unique to those who are mentally ill or in drug abuse.
Wine has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint images or write novels, are here and there to make sure they cross the border between dream, imagination and reality.
Dreams changed the state of consciousness can occur in different ways, in the best case we tell them a vision, in worse errors.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, however, the vision of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experience of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castanedy, the shaman state of blouse, psychosis and hallucination can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucination or vision will occur if the balance of neuronal brain transmitters - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and misconceptions occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravitation doesn't have much to do with it.
The connection between the sex and sleep has been between philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in a awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, found in 1861 "a great similarity to the delusions of dreams", for Sigmund Freuda was even a dream of "psychoza, with all nonsense, overcrowding, slandering of meanings".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. changes in comics.
His body is double-dimensional and crickety.
Gravitation over him has no power, he's standing at the roof of the room.
Feels like a shock.
He's surrounded by red blood cells, priced teeth.
He chases him, digs him with heavy fire boots, throws him on the wall, feels pain all over the body.
Voice, bad voices threaten the wall and the radio.
He can't bear the voices that they give him and insult him anymore.
Henning T. will pull two cables out of the steroid, take them into the loop and tie them to the hook on the ceiling.
He's going to stand on one of the speakers, and he's going to put his shirt around his neck.
He's jumping.
Smicka's on the phone.
Learn, the voices of the congregation are shaking his drums, "Go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, experienced six acute psychos, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
They were released from LSD.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic paranoid psychosis, besides it is maniodepressive, taking medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
I've experienced the worst fear and the deepest suspicions in my psychology, he says.
Examples Are Terrible Reality
Approximately one percent of people are sick at least once for the life of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the scars cannot be distinguished by most internal and external worlds, they are in a confused state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relational illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Especially extended is the hearing of voices - voices that order, comment or lead dialogues.
No optical hallucinations are unusual.
The disabled are unable to distinguish the important from the minor, the brain cannot filter the destructive signals, the consciousness is flooded.
Just as a dream opens the psychosis, it has seen a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest kinds of consciousness.
The perception of the reality of psychology is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, a top doctor at the clinic of general psychiatric clinics in Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of action, everything matters to him.
At the same time it becomes a passive role, it becomes, like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot actively form them.
Schizophrenics are therefore often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not possible in most of them, suspicions are terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Once for Life experienced hallucinations
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchss, "there remains a meaningful and spatial structure of the reality that man perceives in psychosis, essentially preserved."
Bloody thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, to cut the experience in the real frame.
The scientist is still at the forefront of the argument, why our brain is making such transformations.
Exceptional attitudes can lead to the short-term loss of a relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone will turn to psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determinant factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that the affected persons have minimal brain damage.
We believe that early development will result in damage to the neuronal brain, such as the mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But there's still a doubt as to how there's a breakdown of the neuronal system that hasn't appeared in years.
Roles also play an impact on the environment - stress or traumatic experiences can be a psychosis initiator if available.
The hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brains get sick
It's crazy that psychotronics suffer with their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, swallow expensive medications, others give money for drugs to get them, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If we view overcrowding as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often just a question.
Kasten has been collecting news of hallucinations and superstitions for ten years, in last year he interpreted his results in the book "Dee Irreale Welt in our Kopf" (The Unreal World in Our Head).
Hallucination, however, belongs to the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also to the surprising number of other diseases.
In addition to psychiatric disorders such as borderline personality or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma are also common.
Surprisingly, he hallucinates under certain conditions and the brain of a healthy person himself.
Hallucination, according to Kasten, consists of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They notice when parts of the brain, in which sense perception is processed, are too active or slightly depressed; if our brain is involved, or if it is not stimulated.
Drugs can trigger this condition as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But there are also incentives, stress, care with love or other exceptional states.
In recent studies, up to a third of those surveyed have experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Prédnène Pomeranska and going to the darkest gymnasium.
Actually, it's a perfectly normal girl.
If it weren't for those pictures and voices.
It may be about the breaks that she'll be told to hang out with her long, dark hair.
When he answers, her colleagues look at her with surprise - no one else sees her and does not hear this boy.
This ridiculous girl thinks she's a drunk dream, but Sarah K. is not, she knows.
He's up, he hears, and he sees the boy, just like he hears, and he sees a girl sitting next to him in the barn.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, the boy likes it.
I'm crazy?
But he knows that this boy and other superstitions aren't real and he's disappearing again.
At night, the appearances are more noticeable
Often, overloads are a burden.
When he sits in the classroom, he cannot follow the teaching for how many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just a new companion, but he explains to all the others hearing and visible on the chart of the mathematical equation.
At night, the sights are more noticeable.
When waiting in his dark room for a sleep that comes rarely and too late, he cannot often distinguish whether it's awake or if it's already asleep, whether the images he sees, the crimmas, or the girl with bleeding cut wounds on her hands and legs come out in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, he yells at those figures.
He doesn't tell his parents and friends about it, they'd think she was crazy.
Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
Vloni has graduated and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations got up.
Ever since she contacted a psychologist at the Internet, Kasten knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Overcrowds are also art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or stimulated, he will be very likely to be hallucinating, says Kasten.
I think the brain doesn't have enough jobs then and takes care of its own fun.
Sarah K., a single girl, had a little girl's fear of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she's been called to since she thought she was not her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that are also processing real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected by Sarah K. to distinguish from their own confusion and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is playing in the brain, and reality is also displayed there.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain come up, so it works so real."
Also the night dreams evaluate Casten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucination of healthy people does not differ primarily from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mental health people are able to identify their errors as unrealistic.
Casten therefore advises its patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border position between sleep and hallucination
In our world too focused on consciousness, the imaginary experience is unfortunately pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor of Heidelberg and head of Psychiatric and Psychotherapy Clinics of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a difficult, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creativeness - overpowering is also art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard examined a so-called oneroid form of experience, a special form of altered consciousness to sleep.
Oneuroid strains are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the person concerned considers to be real and cannot even distinguish them again from the awake state.
The state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as polyradicular inflammation, which is experienced by the full consciousness of motor protection.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps lasting, complete inability to move, he replaces life threatening the real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of borderline between sleep and hallucination.
Because reality is not possible to deal with a situation, the world changes, but the real situation is in the picture.
Intensive form of mind support and the transfer of meanings in some inalienable situation that enables us to pass on our own ability to form, at the moment, to loss of consciousness.
It's all real, and later in memory.
The historian of art Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after surgery, a heart boy with a subsequent transplant heart gave his mind on a several - way journey, and his body was immediately on an intensive care unit.
Claussen went into the world that he created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an old man based on bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot guards his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages in the middle of a barn that produces fake blood-derived substances.
On the engine, the river takes it to its own power, on the hospital bed surfing the fir tree in the Alps and meets the Korean mafia.
He's completely in the imagination, everything's real, and later in the memories.
These internal journeys for Claussen are essentially different from any dream.
Son is a different condition, describing his experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of these mental journeys are still clear after years and in minor details.
Even clearer and more intense than real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other real experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, they show oneroid states, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug addiction, how fragile our inner image of external reality is even in the wake of the situation.
Every change of state of mind, says psychologist Casten, "may lead to deformation of what we call reality."
A reality that can also be enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
In 27 they have to take charge of the children
The new truck driver Kallen is a transitional solution: In the long run, Hubert Burd wants to hand his business over to his two children, said SPIEGEL.
Holding is supposed to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Hubert Burd's employer sees his company for a long time in the hands of his children.
Both children will be born in 27 years of age and have a strong desire to enter the company, says 69-year-old man SPIEGEL.
We've dealt with the details carefully.
The question is, if they're also active in the company, it's up until then.
And the question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put 7500 employees in front of their children if they are not able enough.
It would kill both children and business.
The Burda announced on Thursday that he had been a member of the Presidency since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
He's 52 years old, Kallen has been a member of a representation at Burundi since 1999.
He was the first to become concerned about technology.
She later added responsibility for the company's property and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's resignation also direct marketing, Cizina, Press and Finance.
At first, none of the family members are in charge.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to "refuse 10, 15 years," Burda told us.
Holding should have 100 percent of the family in the future, says Burda.
With regard to Schickedanz and Schaeffler's case, Burda said that no family businesses had any certainty before the crash: "It has always happened to companies that have allowed themselves to be punished by the greed of capital that they speculated about and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had a dream of world power, says Burda.
I don't feel like the political receiver of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time", these shops are too big.

Endesa to Barcelona, with electric car
The Energy Company Endesa, together with the Barcelona Council, founded the 'Live Office'.
This is a project for the development and promotion of electricity in the capital city of Catalonia.
The LIVE' office (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) will establish and manage the roadmap for the introduction of electric cars in the city and ensure agreements in the field of mobility, will set up, coordinate and pre-proposal grants, etc.
The project will also develop MOVELE, promote electric cars, collect opinions and performance in the sectors involved.
Overall, it is intended to support this means of transport for the future.
3 'Electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city involved in the project to introduce electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will join the project as well.
It is three cities that have chosen the government under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
Energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative with Endesy's participation in the promotion of electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a quiet period in the automotive industry.
The president of the government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is waiting for "a quiet period".
In the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero took steps to support the automotive sector during the year.
"Without the Competition Plan for the automotive sector, we would now be in a state of abandonment, closing up some of our main manufacturing companies," the president of the government said.
"Thanks to this plan and the desire to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of peace in this industry, which is our main export sector, has been added to the future," he said.
In this regard, he argued that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integrated Road Sector Plan (PIA), had set 800 million for projects by 19 producers and 137 aid firms, which had mobilised investments exceeding EUR 3 billion.
The president explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for modernising production and current processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government measures on the aid requirement and mentioned plan 2000E, which is applicable in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6%, and ensured a "significant increase" of the records, specifically in November of "40%".
20.000 square metres of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first International Classic Vehicle salon will be opened, which is a space for meeting professionals and amateurs from the world of motor vehicles.
This initiative will take place on 5-7 February 2010 at the Madrid Casa de Campo Glass pavilion.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, to which more than 200 foreign and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but also in ClassicAuto Madrid all kinds of products related to the world of motors.
The exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classical motors, real drawers for collectors and scientists.
The following will be included among the companies involved:Clasicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renewal; or Cochera Classics, specialized Mercedes Benz.
Exterior capacity tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: concerting, sports performances, testing, presentations and competitions.
Tests will also be carried out on the ability of classic cars and motorcycles in an appropriate area outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Sports style conservation
It may be intended to show that the proximity to the environment has no negative impact on the sport style.
And that's why Mazda3 has a built-in system of stopping and starting the engine - also baptized as-Stop-, which is a device that is currently available only with a gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by the good characteristics it has achieved as a whole.
Surface adjustment, vehicle performance, population, behaviour, mechanics, i-stop system...
All these aspects are excellent at Mazda3.
The front seats in the driver's seats have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The phone is also extremely nice.
With tools and consoles, we conclude that Mazda continues to develop a Japanese trend in the development of futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a marked red and blue color.
This style reminds us partly of the style that also presents Honda Civic.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrasting with the sharpness of German products and specifically more sVolkswagen Golf, which all want to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, mention should be made of a large storage space and regular forms.
The automatic stop and start-up system is currently only available with a petrol engine of two litres and 150 horsepowers with an asphalt manual transmission.
This engine is a real lamp. It is very soft, marked with reduced noise, performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not find so many kilometers per year should not exclude this i-stop with a petrol engine, because it is more comfortable when driving and reducing consumption.
As for equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
The serial equipment needs to mention, above all, the system of monitoring of the traffic lanes (RVM), which protects the formation of the dead corner, control of knowledge and stability, control of speed, internal flashlight sensitive to light, a high-screen circuit computer, parking devices, individual air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and a wheel from 17palc slinth.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped Pack Premium, plus 1,500 euros: adaptable dual-axon and sound system BOSE with CD holder, except for other components.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It shall specify, in particular, the quality of the materials used, its operation and the high level of equipment.
And in addition, people who don't find more miles a year can choose this i-stop version, which is only with a petrol engine2.0 and 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its highest price, which makes €21.770 in the implementation of Luxury and €23.270 in the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premier'

Slib FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, serves only for mail viewing, without being able to browse certain type of attachments or surfing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of U.S. glory when his Time magazine considered it one of the products of the year.
Seeing her outside is harder, but that idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
In contrast to smartphones, Beijing is marked by very low prices and monthly payments, less than half of the amount that is applicable, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new facilities: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of the long-term free data services provided, but for which it is necessary to pay for the six-fold amount of Peak.
FonPeek, who was introduced to the Le Web yesterday, is a European version of the invention and at the same time its third change.
It's just as limited as its American counterpart, but it brings surprises.
The monthly maintenance price is about 12 euros a month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
Traveling people with a smartphone already know what it means to come up with data services after crossing the borders or to search for a coffee shop with WiFi (if you connect Fon) so they can look for mail.
The romantic attack at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced long ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience, a person would need a doctorate from physics to understand them, and also a very good glasses to read a miniature letter.
The European Commission is constantly calling for a reduction in roaming tariffs so that they can be made available for Europe as a whole, which still has no cost-effective effect.
There is a basic concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (is interesting that he still has the name Fon if he does not have WiFi) reach this type of tariff means that operators start to think differently and consider various offers that would compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another fine example, offers download books and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is applicable during purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect will happen once in the case of FonPeek, it's about the possibility of buying with a permanent approach like that that Peek has already been introduced into the United States.
Not because I'd like to buy it.
I'm looking at the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it's from the consumer's point of view the best type.
It would be interesting if the tennis system could also be used in the computer.
The color Michelle worships.
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first woman in the United States.
For Barack Obama's appearance as president of the United States, she chose dress and coat in this color, and she also chose the same color when she accompanied her at the second most important moment of her life: giving the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that it is a similar color - yellow with triple effects-, in both cases it was a classic set - dress, bag and coat of the same substance - decorated with a large height or waistcoat.
At first glance it seemed that the first woman in the United States decided to go in the footsteps of the Austrian princess and wear similar clothing.
The fabric from which the clothing is made makes both models significantly different.
On the occasion of Michelle's performance, she used a large corner, in Oslo with a printing press.
Measurements and supplements: green boots with medium high heels, similar model, but in gold color.
It also wears various parts: this timerdole, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to maternity.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in women of younger age who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Nursing and working career of Spanish women' carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
The study was attended by 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities on the labour market due to maternity.
The study highlights that at the beginning of the partnership, there are many differences in views on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work for part-time or do not have stable jobs, start living with a partner before the first child is born and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partnering and maternity leave, and have fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49 years with stable employment have the first child on average 3.7 years from the start of the marriage with the partner. This figure makes 4.1 in the case of women who have made most of their stable employment and therefore had to postpone the partnership and the income of the children.
The type of call also has a strong influence on maternity, although it has a minor influence on the time of the start of the marriage with the partner," explains Margarita Delgado, who is dedicated to research in CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of the marriage of the anorexia of the offspring is the degree of education.
The research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age when women marry and have their first child.
The differences are also between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group 35 to 49, women with basic and higher education gave birth to their first child at 25.1 years of age, e.g. 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their degree of education.
Women with basic education marry and give birth to the first child before finding a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education do otherwise prefer to obtain a stable job before the marriage and birth of the first child,” Delgado says.
Diane Kruger's worth it, too.
L'Oréal Paris just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
Since next year, the German actress will face various products of this brand under the universal password 'Cause I'm behind it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most outstanding actors at international level, is thus added to another famous characterL'Oréal Paris as for example Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Even before her, she joined this selected actress, Evangeline Lilly ('Dead') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire of the Chatter').
The Panic part of this cosmetic brand is also represented by significant personalities:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelical's partner in the Lost).
Prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to talk about in fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, former and current - met at the annual price transfer that took place in London at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen the best model of the year.
Poker Manuela Vicenta
Manuel Vicente presents thirty X-rays of writers in 'Esový poker' (Alfaguara, illustration by Fernando Vicente), with whom he met in his literary life (and in some cases even in ordinary life).
He does not do so in frightened and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but he is looking for something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The road brings excitement and Vincent doesn't care about the benefits or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading experience, even in repeated reading.
Here's some sights.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be termed: the benefit of prejudice, morals without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote by his own nature and not by his intellect, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, without meaning as if it were a knife that almost killed her."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been devoted to this woman for the entire thirteen years, the luxury, the pleasure and the pleasure, which is the spiritual decree for the achievement of heaven by the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "Tohoto Odysseus released in Paris in 1922 Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-dimensional peaks in universal literature, which needs to be overcome by the northern side, from which the best horoscopes often disappear."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
He said of himself that he was the heir to the shipyard, or that he was the son of a black man with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a big dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught this man's mad scream at the bridge from the Mnich to bring his answer to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running ahead of himself and calling into the future and speaking fast to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One of them kneeled down and prayed, 'God, my beloved, make me stop writing as a woman.'
About Joseph Conrad: "At his grave, the Spenser's verse was pronounced: 'After effort, the storm will come a quiet port,/after the war of rest,/after the full life of death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "He also took his depression into his engagements.
His husband fully agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her between the azals or that the birds were singing Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic, whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pio Baroja: "What else happened to Martin Santos than to target Joyce to Baroje?
What happened to Bennett other than letting Baroness fix Faulkner's weapon?
And what is the matter with the Celebrates, that he should be glorified for the glory of that man?
Free of Aggression
Last week, my seven-year-old mother passed through our fourth, during Fuenlabrad, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by and our dog, a cross saved from a rope of up to six kilograms, without a single word touched her twice and seriously hurt her.
Our enthusiasm is that we do not see anything fun in such aggression against a small and defenseless animal that was also on the run.
And to that end, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she was shooting at these individuals, began to worry about her own safety, because such a demon- possessed man who attacks an animal is able to do the same to the woman, the child, the old man or anyone who is worse than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in a usually quiet quarter.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have complained to the nearest Commissioner, but we doubt that it was something, and in order not to raise the question of fraud, we find that these rescue murders were Spanish nationality.
The excitement led us to announce this reality.
We don't understand what's going on with today's youth when they're having trouble with a defenseless animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We don't understand where the right education is divided, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmet
The manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Transport Safety Supply (Fesvial), launched a campaign to support the use of helmets, especially in younger motorists, as both of these entities have reported today.
The aim of this initiative is to highlight the importance of using helmets, because it is the only means to prevent head injury and death in the event of an accident when driving on a motorcycle.
Michelin points out that this campaign is part of their transport safety commitments, which means "more than designing and producing even safer products", and confirmed that it is trying to meet this objective in other words, in the form of instruction and information campaigns.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets when driving on a motorcycle, under the word 'To be or not to be', is the first phase, when up to 500 motorcycles repaired will be developed to get to the widest public awareness.
In conclusion, Michelin pointed out that transport safety "is a constant problem" of this company, which is a manufacturer of dual-vehicle tyres and whose main objective is to continuously increase product safety.
Increased sales of light-duty vehicles
Almost two years later, the market for light-duty vehicles begins to rememulate.
All 9,425 vehicles found in November in Spain accounted for an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more than that, the first increase after 22 months of permanent collapse, according to the number of patronage organisations of Anfac and Ganvam producers.
However, the positive data is better put into quarantine, because November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and meant 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rise in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles belonging to the category of light commercial vehicles: personal car derivatives, pick-ups, deliveries, smaller trucks and light trucks/trailers.
And even the clouds that most damage the demand, even though they were purchased by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized enterprises and in 100% of cases it is funding through third parties.
The restriction resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans should also be added to other factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of the bad economic situation.
In this situation, unlike the passenger cars, the purchase support 2000E did not help too much.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention the isosby operating on the nutrition sheet of small and medium-sized enterprises that intend to buy a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, from Ganvam, they recalled the need to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles and also industrial vehicles (stones and buses).
The association of sellers assumes that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to the sales estimates in the passenger cars and 4x4 will decrease by 19%.
The auxiliary hand brake system is already mandatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock system, this will also be done with the management of the stability of the ESP, auxiliary hand brake systems, all of which will become mandatory for the equipment of European vehicles.
In fact, it is already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly proven passenger cars and light-duty vehicles, while others have set a deadline for the removal of the deficiency, which is February 2011.
Measures introduced in the EU aim to increase the protection of pedestrians, which works so that it can help prevent many hits.
The auxiliary hand brake system increases the pressure on the brakes in the event of a emergency, which will find out when the driver falls.
But he can't always keep this pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of the Bosch car parts, a third of the drivers who have an accident did not send the brake before the impact and half of them did not fully use the brake force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum braking system, reduces the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to the study carried out in the EU alone, if all vehicles were fitted with this type of device, up to 1 100 fatal accidents could be prevented annually from walking.
The reduction of this number will be even more significant, according to the calculations, one of four incidents with an impact on persons-after the introduction of so-called intelligent manual braking systems.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system which (by radar or camera) will capture the obstacles and report them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the impactor cannot be prevented, the device shall adapt as much as possible to the brake and reduce the risk of damage to the minimum.
General Motors sets up a plan for Opel to the ice
Nick Reilly, new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably 8 April - as Javier Ortega informed, the American producer notes that it will take more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to ensure that each point of the plan is first agreed on by the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plant is located, will be issued by the beginning of 2010.
On the contrary, the GM ensures that the SAAB sales decision should be adopted in these days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the US producer to make certain decisions as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to get Volvo, but considers the possibility of a Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars acting under the protection of the Russian Converg group.
In case it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s Chinese company Baic’s assets.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year shall continue to apply if its sale is not successful.
Jizda with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this excellent model, the engineers from Porsche used Boxster S as the basis and managed to reduce their weight by 80 kg, thus showing only 1,275 kg.
On the basis of the first series, automatic charging was carried out with manual control, with a weight reduction of 21 kg; the threshold was used, for example, GT3, which means another 15 kg less; the removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of fuel supply from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to the reduction of the weight of another 7 kg; after the installation of other sports seats of 12 kg, thanks to the length of 19palco wheels, five kilograms.
Finally, the removal of the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and the replacement of the doors by textile capture means another kilogram.
It is also offered with a two-way PDK transmission, one vehicle with a hand-held six-stage speed box was tested, mainly on the second class roads in California, on the mountain sections with many intertwined trains.
His conduct can only be qualified as irrevocable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle is not printed for asphalt.
Rather, we have long not tested such a small and lightweight model, which would at the same time pass on such safety when moving in motion, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete able to heat muscles in a short drive after the necessary time until we order him a sprint, braking, and re-use of the engine...
Whatever we want, thanks to the management that's so communicative as accurate, whatever we mark with our hands on the wheel, that's what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical accuracy.
Engine sound according to will
The V6 boxer sound, with 320 horses (about 10 more than Boxster S) is very powerful and it is possible to strengthen it's ability to 'sport' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that has already been used in Panama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether it's already raining or recuperating.
The locks are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we're traveling with Boxster Spyder was pretty ruined, but the car managed well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; however, in some tracks we found light on the freezing and snow even in the advanced afternoon.
This ultra-light car is definitely one of the most fun on the market, as it's about something more than just changing Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at EUR 70.831.

Basconia gave herself a victory in Israel
The job was a brilliant victory in 82-91 at its complex Maccabi Electra hostel, despite the numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice company, and thus reached the head of its group after Mirja Teletovice's large performance, which with eight three points was the best statement in the company (29 evaluations).
Vitorie has been able to replace the significant inability of Herrmann, Olesona, Huertase or Micova with a large dose of placement and collective work, although it had to endure to the end to win.
In addition, there was a great deal of precision from the circle with 16 triple points involved in the final triumph.
The trap began in front of the blue ones who had been put on the mark from the beginning.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, already indicating that they attacked the Israelite society very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alav Association decided for the internal game of Baraca and Elijah’s work, which was accepted by sand and lightning upon returning to its original position to increase the benefit before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to appear as the best in his 13-point company, although 'without six' at the Splitter' evaluation already indicated that it would not be the best night for Brazil.
But although the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the least and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vittoria that not everyone wins on their play, and 'Eliyas' managed to win.
Eidson and Pnini have certainly contributed to the return of the 'growth' to the broadcast (50-49).
More inappropriate
Ivanovic's members, wounded but not dead at all, needed a few exact games to breathe, and then came the Mirza Teletovic tower, which with three thirds almost by itself and with the help of English and Ribase returned scores to a soothing number (54-67), reaching locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Alašti sieves skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not be allowed to be prepared by someone for the due results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their manhood, did not give up and tried to keep the company alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this and with the Splitter excluded for the Faul seIvanovic they hated and defended well, and although the Israelites were approaching the final minute (80-85), the match had already won and Tel Aviv lost first in the season.
The injury makes it impossible for Unica to fight
The Union has lost significantly in Greece with Olympiacos and left it the leadership of Group B in Eurolise in a battle marked by three attacks by the Union, but above all by the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which has made Greek victory easier.
Malagasy did not dwell on the environment of Pavilion's peace and friendship or rivals, perhaps one of the sick in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to sleep. Aggressive defenses and three thirds of them, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubia, blew up the game with 12-18 minutes.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicija , although the arsenal of locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcice and Schortsanitis, surrounded the score 22-20, a minute 13 which was the moment when the battle between resistances with USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek Society began to function and demonstrated its influence in both areas, where the absence of an English beer due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal faults Carlos Jiménez made it difficult for the Unika Association
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian wing of Linas Kleizas with three points increased the advantage to 44-32, minutes 19.
Absence
The third part was very aggressive by Olympiacos, who, despite his loss of 19 years old, showed an advantage and even managed to balance the difference from the fight in Malaga, 66-48, a minute 27 that was wasted by the leadership of the group.
Unikaja tried to overcome the absence and the last inability of the Scottish brewer Robert Archibald, who was injured during the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unika thanks to the leadership and the three points of Cook and the benefit of Levise, she left a sure hope of victory 66-57, minutes 31.
But it was practically impossible because Olympiacos, thanks to the reinforcement and transfer in centimeters in his area, proved that it was unstoppable.
Croatia's brewer Nikola Vujcic, managed to equalize basket average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja took the lead in Olympiacos.
How much should you tape for your profile on Facebook?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the payment that they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit application, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads in the field of reality, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
Tool How much should you take? calculates user payments on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form that is available on Facebook, where you need to put professions, years of experience, age and city where the interested person wants to work.
During the week what the application works, the researcher found that the Spanish worker generally felt "badly rewarded", explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for Trovit.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spain is the worst payment.
The British programmer takes 45.226 euros a year and French 31.059, while Spain receives 24,000.
The driver also has 34.247 euros per year in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, in Spain, the highest paid employee's work is 11.592 euros per year; it follows a seller with 14.725 euros and a worker with 15.667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are drivers, part-time employment and social workers.
Brazil sets Zelay's departure date
The Brazilian government set the deadline for Manuel Zelayi's execution at his embassy in Tegucigalpe.
The President-in-Office must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate is officially terminated.
Francisco Catunda, charge d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in Honduras City, confirmed for TV Globe that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy to this date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"It is known that on January 27th, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and look for other shelters."
The station also quoted the former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline stated: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the protection of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the elections on 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya made sure that it would be held in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, a teenager tried to get shelter in Brazil for a week.
The operation finally collapsed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum, which he was trying to put in place by the "de facto" government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After days of wine and roses from the past spring, when inflation represented a dominant mood on the markets, there was uncertainty again on the markets, which should not surprise us, because it is already a natural state in the environment where managers make decisions about a future that does not exist on their own.
The drug used by central banks to stabilise the market was debt-laundering of direct purchases of assets and indirect release of liquidity in the course of near zero so that financial institutions could buy assets to the offsetting.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically completed, and without doubt their uneven liquidity policy, they are starting to throw a little sand into the conflict, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
The investors are therefore in doubt about the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we will participate in the return of the reduction of risk.
The movement of storms and differences in debt companies have again gained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal level they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialise their private risks, which again affected public debt.
Again, the pressure on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany have become a shelter for the selected investors, which has expanded the differentiation of the euro area countries towards Germany.
Spain was almost unaffected by this instability, but at the time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the Spanish Kingdom's qualifications.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not ineffective for the silence of moral risk actors who have tried to re-suspension the conscience of those responsible for the world's economic policy in order to speed up the disastrous consequences of limiting credit to employment, when in fact a new day of gratitude should be expressed.
However, the situation in Dubai represents the tribal struggles between emirate power recovery emirates, and with regard to Greece, we have seen this before.
A government that covers the deficit, elections and the new government is taking place.
He did this in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro Member State to fail to fulfil its obligations.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin has made the Greek government transparent and committed its own citizens to shared responsibility in the need for exceptional measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the transitional risk premium normalisation period, some surpluses in supported positions would be expected.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European differences are being reduced and our situation continues to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The importance of Standard & Poor's is only anecdotes. When our leading indicators force most of the studies to carry out their scenarios of renewal and review their scenario of accession to 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it will not be a great hope for the Spanish economy to meet this warning.
Again, it seems to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being "carefully, my friend drivers".

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán, as the first yesterday, took part in the subcommission of MPs, where the energy strategy of Spain is being discussed in the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by the speech of President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villasecy, Galán gave a few comments on the proposal submitted by the subcommission behind the closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs to invest EUR 50,000 million by 2020 and another EUR 60,000 million from this date by 2030, if nuclear power plants are being maintained, which are currently in operation.
If this is not the case, the investment will not be 60,000 million but up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrola is of the opinion that in the next decade, investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
Since 2020, the issue is changing and the performance will have to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, it is believed that there is a need for new 18,000 MW, including other "supported energy".
Galán, who is considered to be a woman of the law on the sustainable economy that the government has just approved, is in line with the line that the company demanded, did not want to leave her alive as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which opposes climate change policies.
According to him, "a clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite "precise" action, as President Iberdrol called it.
Whatever the case, Galán is of the opinion that the investment decision, although long-term, must start to take place now, because their maturity is ongoing and a stable tax framework is necessary for their launch.
Ferrovial wins 'action' Aer Lingus on ten airports
The subsidiary Ferrovial for Land Services, Switzerland Swissport, will play the role of a preferred Irish airline airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement that has not yet come into force on economic terms shall be valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol on cooperation on the creation of the Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructure
The association is expected to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which is Ferrovial.
One of the objectives of the Centre will be to explore energy efficiency at airports and airports.
Action strives for its first road in Australia against Hochtift and Bouygues
The action fights for its first concession on the highway in Australia, which is the market where it is already working as an energy and water business.
The building is estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (as well as 1,047 million euros).
Its competitors are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtift.
The tunnel 5 km long in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option for Actiona to settle in this country as a construction and concession highway company.
The workshop wants to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP according to initial in English) for further development of the project in the trade plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the mill.
The tenders are expected to be submitted in May and the expected investment will reach 1,700 million Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and at the final stage of the competition three groups with significant presence in European buildings.
The group called Transcity runs Actiona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest construction companies in Australia and the second is one of the largest European underground specialists in Italy.
Against the Actiona group is the Northern Direct group with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French building group Bouygues.
The third and last group, which has passed through the network, has the name LBRJV and is divided into the Australian capital Lightton (the subsidiary of the construction company of Hochtift, here represented by ACS), as well as the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the famous company specialising in the civil buildings of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large buildings and privatization, but it carries a clear difficulty to enter otherwise than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
In addition to the Asian references, the strategy under which Hochtivit or Bilfinger was run is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS gained market position through its 30% share in Hochtifift, owner of Lightton quoted company.
Million assets
The action is based on a geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector in which it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier activities and in the disposal trade.
In addition to other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of companies that set up and adjust the settlement facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the construction and infrastructure areas.
The underground road, which is the proponent of the Brisbane Infrastructure Office, with the name Northern Link (Northern link), is intended to connect the western road from Toowong to the surrounding road in Kelvin Grove (see map) within 5 km of the tunnel. It is the biggest action to reduce the traffic burden of Brisbane.
The calendar established by the local administration is planning tasks for 2010 and starting work for December next year.
Although this pay pass would be open in the last few months of 2014, the full completion of the work is planned until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will contain two flows in each direction, an electronic oral and complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its financing.
Brisbane already offered this order Hochtivot
Australia still brings significant profits to Hochtiv because it announced yesterday a government contract estimated at 154 million.
Share ACS by means of its Leighton local branch of the national broadband network with an optical fibre cable.
This situation will allow fast access to the Internet for 400,000 people and will provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the King George tower building on 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work should only start and Hochtift closed the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC has been allocated a 64 million tunnel in Slovenia
Through its branches, the FCC received the allocation of a tunnel building of 2,1 kilometres long for a distance in Slovenia worth EUR 64,5 million.
The company received a contract a few days after working to expand the tunnel in Bosruck (Russia) by 130 million.
This way, the Alpine reinforces its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of work is planned at the beginning of 2010 and the period for implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore got a commercial at Renfe
Renfe has provided advertising and marketing services for the last two years, Mrs Rushmore has informed the railway company about the amount of three million euros a year.
The contract contains the possibility of a 12-month extension each year. Ms. Rushmore was selected among the 16 agencies that were represented in the competition published by Renfe, from which four were posted to the finale, among them TBWA, who was responsible for creating advertising for the last three years.
From this moment on, Mrs. Rushmore will take care of the design and production of the campaign.
Sketch 63 million for France Télécom for distortion of competition
The regulatory authority for competition in France has imposed a fine of 63 million euro lFrance Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas that belong to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes with consumers on the edge of the regulation.
Touto sanctions have been purchased by the former French monopoly and the state company has still purchased more than 560 million euros since 1994 to impose obstacles on its competitors.
Last night's fine was de facto raised because the competition authority is believed to have allowed France Télécom to commit a similar offence as in the past, and therefore it has come back.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened a business with internet applications to increase revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, trade with Orange applications will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry into other countries such as Spain.
Play in the league Champions brought from the beginning 476.4 million to Madrid and Barche
The Masters League has been a source of revenue for these clubs since its creation in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have made 476,4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth most profitable club in competition.
The list says Manchester United.
The list says Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Masters League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue for large clubs.
To the extent that the competition divided the EUR 5,362.5 million between 105 companies (of which 12 Spanish) that participated in this action since the 1992/1993 season tournament, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have come out of this division very well.
The white club was the third on the continent with the most money that he got involved, and the only one with AC Milan, who won three times the main price.
The Catalan current champion and the last winner of the missing European Cup in 1992 is in the fifth classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two associations that also counted the most money for participation in the previous League of Masters.
And even though she's lost both of them with Barç.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country that received the most money through the Champions, although it received the most titles from all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This obvious paradox is explained by a complex process in the distribution of the money used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the body chaired by Michel Platini will make a plan of 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of these funds, UEFA allocated 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous classification cycle (including Athletics Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, the participants received 3.8 million only for their presence, plus another 550,000 euros for each match they participate in.
There are also prizes for winning (800,000 euros) and for remistration (400,000 for each company). Osmiffinals get three million each; eight quarter-finalists 3.3 million.
Each of the last four will get 4 million.
The champion will make 9 million while the second finalist is 5.2 million.
So the club will make a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for victory in the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments for which there are 337,8 million.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones and has four designated seats.
Last year's champion will receive 40% of the allocated money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
The New Rumas Group last night published details of the offer of buying shares, which would help to gain a top position between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.
This percentage does not involve making a public offer for the acquisition (optional) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 for the shares that she would pay in ten years and for which she would pay interest for this deposit 1% per year.
Yesterday Sos had finished trading at EUR 1.85; therefore, New Rumas' offer of a company rating of 18% below market value.
According to New Rumas, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Council.
The Jerez Group shall provide a period of 15 days to notify the shareholders of its interest in the sale.
CNMV declared that it was not informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateose confirmed that it was linked to the regulatory authority.
If the purchase was made, the price would be 611.7 million, while Sos capitalization is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, the sauce continues to change the structure of its management.
As an attempt to disrupt the possible bids on the border to buy and settle the judicial expenses of his former leaders, the brothers of Jesus and Jaime Salazars, the election of Marie Luisy Jordan was announced as the head of the internal audit.
This Decision is made by the first woman who has had a high role in the food business.
It is a newly created place that will be subject directly to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from the controversy since the company is still undermining in the legal battle of the alleged movement of more than 230 million from Sos brothers Salazars.
In fact, it cannot be denied that in the coming months, Sos will discover new transfers of funds.
With regard to Salazars' credit, the former members of the National Court of Justice of Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) said yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing where they were located.
CNMV allows the option to exclude Paterna who participated in Inversora Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved an exemption, with the participation of Inversora Mer, to Federico Patrin on 9 October.
The supervisory authority has explained that it authorises this operation, since it understands that its conditions meet the applicable standards, and considers that the "sufficient" content of the brochures submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
CNMV clarified that the offer is targeted at acquisition550.008 of Federica Paternini shares at 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the company's capital, which is made up of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on stock exchanges in Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were neglected, which could not be transferred in any way until the offer was closed, which it specified that the price was fixed by the Federal Paterni in accordance with the applicable standards.
New tools for car assessment
In these days storms and accidents make not only autoservices.
Each day of thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance event are withdrawn to a service where the knower must estimate the damage and the cost of repair.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the cost for the part and time of the labour force may be long and difficult work.
Calculate the cost of repairing from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and working force can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of a minute.
That's why almost 100% know-how uses this kind of system.
Suppliers of services and solutions for the assessment of insurance events and maintenance shall use the information provided to them by manufacturers to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audetex is a leading company from the American Group of Solera; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of instruments for assessing and processing information about the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the producers is not at all simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Managing Director Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers and each of them provides information in another format.
In addition, the number of data for processing continues to grow, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been mentioned in the last five years than in the previous fifty years.
Once the new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
It is a very hot job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and set its price.
In addition, in each model, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out, where it is possible to "exploit" individual parts of tourist vehicles.
As for the model with massive sales, work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
In the case of a minority car, it may take three or four months. At present, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the driving park around them, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation and database work, Audatex has eight centres divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national residence is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanical experts) work with three computer screens.
Auditex invests 90 million euro annually in the development of these databases.
Every month 2.5 million data are classified, and customers are updated every two days.
The processing of this incalculable flow of information enables businesses to make different use and supply of different products.
The most common use is focussed on repair and maintenance, but according to individual countries, there are also tools for handling spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of the car.
Eurotax is the only company that has a driver who informs about the value of vehicles used in Spain.
Audetex doesn't offer them in our country, but in the United States it does.
It is easy to get the support that professionals can use in the sector, with a focus on the products they offer.
This company offers ten different instruments, with AudaPlus as the star product, the standard solution for assessing the insurance events intended for the know-how.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the part, it shall also include time to repair the estimated manufacturer or lacquer.
This instrument shall be applied for each assessment.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it less than ten times a month.
Then every insurance undertaking carrying out thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN enable the complete identification of the vehicle and the equipment with which it emerged from the assembly line only on the basis of the first transport number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service for the professional sector on the Internet, which allows to dispose of vehicles with a total insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analysis or finding deviations according to brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models have passed the service due to the accident or how many have suffered serious insurance events for a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing this type of tool.
It sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for the know-how and also provides digital images, access to works or prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company founded in 1971 as a supplier of services and solutions to the injury, accident or maintenance of cars
Gt Guia rating is her reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3,100 acquaintances and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover rose by 20% annually over the last three years and in 2008 they accounted for EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, the internationalization of the plant office in Paris began.
Auditex was established in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the sources of the company, 62% of her brother is born in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The World Invoicing Group Solarer (Audtex, Sidex, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company makes €19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group became a stock exchange of $1,000 and now its shares are estimated to be $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed at the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet sale of unmanned vehicles
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation provided for the saving of EUR 59.5 million from 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended by the remaining 15% next year.
The objective of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with access to the vast international market.
This assessment and purchase and sale service is exclusively handed to professionals in the sector such as insurance, knowledge, loans, services, sales of spare parts and professional sales, which must be registered before the start of the operation.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
The main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The web currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and adds about 100 new ads every day to the Spanish market.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose vehicle number was cut off cannot be returned to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that were not damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be allowed to operate, even if they have been cut off, after the preliminary procedure.
Budget of the service in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex ensures that the user receives the budget only in four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for spare part, creation of the budget generation budget.
The ease of use is a fundamental condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of professionals of a higher age who are more or less sustainable in the use of new techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including tourist 666, 109 pitches, 137 motorcycles, 78 deliveries and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer to connect to the Internet.
After identification of the model to be repaired, using the transport number, a real graphical display of the model will appear and the necessary spare part will then be selected.
The user may include variables as the price of the labour force, supplements or discounts, and then print and pass on to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an AudaPlus rating tool, but rather a reference catalogue.
