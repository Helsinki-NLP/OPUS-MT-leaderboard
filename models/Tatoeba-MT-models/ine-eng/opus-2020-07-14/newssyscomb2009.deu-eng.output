The triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, in total, is 29 percent
A tangible weakening of the two parties of the former Great Coalition and a significant strengthening of the parties to the rule of law led to the first preliminary parliamentary elections from Sunday to Sunday in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (ODP) suffered losses, where the position of former President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously at stake.
On the contrary, the head of the association for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, stands for a triumphal return to the federal policy.
According to the previous results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, compared to the last elections in 2006, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes.
It is even worse to cut off the GSP, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the history of the Austrian post-war, and especially in the People's Party that requested the elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the OVP had emerged from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear advantage over the SPÖ.
The voters, however, probably punished the party for failing the government.
In the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible withdrawal of the Chairman and former Deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case at an extraordinary meeting of the Management Board on Monday.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely exit from the electoral debacle, i.e. a renewal of the large coalition from SPÖ and OVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two legal parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) received 18 per cent, the BZÖ received 11 per cent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fears at the same time that 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party with the Popular Talks (at that time the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it had split itself from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which even led to sanctions on the part of the European Union.
It is obvious that Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with each party and from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal policy, is putting forward this development.
In addition, the Green Party, which suffered slight losses and was removed from third place by the Austrian political parties in the fifth place, was also brought to Parliament.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percentile and consequently did not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who were accused in India because of the illegal collection of cages, in the view of the Czech Foreign Minister, Karel Schwarzenberg, it might be possible to cool down the Czech-India relations.
This was highlighted by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian official, Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then sure, it will come to some cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, in judicial matters the executive could only take a difficult step.
Despite all this, he argued that in the case of Peter Szvácha, who was acquitted of the charge and received a fine, the central government wants the local government in Dardjiling, in which the matter falls.
"His problem could be explained," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, it would be Mukherdshi's view that it would be best if he went to jail at a higher court.
He could ask for a release on bail and wait in freedom for his judgment, as the Minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had spoken in the same way in negotiations.
"He recommends a summons at a higher court, then he will be questioned," said the chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to allow the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian minister suggested.
At the same time, he said that such help would already be offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also gave this to," led Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, he confirmed, so the Czech Press Agency ČTK, in front of his partner, the Czech Republic, played a major role in the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he explained.
One answer to the question whether he has received the commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter is different from the Minister.
"I've already been promised a lot," he just said.
A check on the ring around the sea floor
It comes to an electronic map that is shown on Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-headed team of the UN Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His boss, the Director of Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, is pursuing the interpretation and supplementing it.
Here is the rule of work and enthusiasm.
The seabed has so far provided only a few known worlds that are rich in natural sources.
Here is oil to be found, then Erz and other non-growth raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which have, for example, the key to developing a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The countries of origin today are very much reporting their claim to the new maritime areas.
After a UN convention, they make use of their rights, to which they united themselves in Montego Bay in Jamaica in 1982.
This is particularly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often goes up to a hundred kilometres from the shores of a country to the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive claim to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplely expressed as a continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It exceeds the limits of the sea, often also the limits of two hundred sea miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the relevant Commission country to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be based on extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have had success," Mikulka added.
An international echo was recently the success of Australia, which, as the first country, could significantly expand its marine areas.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times the size of the country.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
The future benefits of using the sea floor will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean supply, which is referred to by the Convention as the "common heritage of humanity", begins.
Then no state has a special position here.
The right to promote in this area is granted to an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea floor, however, is not a gold miner country," says a somewhat exaggerated Director Mikulka, adding that "its individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech in Pacific
Part of the seabed is also part of the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastblock within the framework of the "Interocean Metal" Joint Organisation.
In 1991, it was awarded the status of a so-called 'road-breaking investor' as well as the investors of a few other countries.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the quiet ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it's a kind of tatra on the sea floor.
"You can go there on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan", says another lawyer, Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian staff of the Rober Sandev Division brings together such a particularity as a pattern.
It reminds of a little potato or, with some imagination, of the telling scheme that the legend has raised after the Golem to life.
German special forces were on site when Geisel was released
The Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come into use.
More and more details are being made known in the circumstances of liberation 11 in Egypt by European tourists.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also directly involved in the rescue operation.
At the same time, both German defence specialists and GSG 9 officials were the Flying Staff of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Chamber, and logistics experts of the Technical Aid Agency at the place of release.
However, as ministers continued on Monday night, the German forces were not needed because the prisoners were running their prisoners and fled when they had recognized signs of a violent release.
The Egyptian Government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve them as local support forces.
"There has been no success in doing so," said one spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The group of attackers from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian, and eight Egyptian companions had been kidnapped in southern Egypt on September 19.
After the expulsion in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad were swept away.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until the last time, as was the details of the release or possible redemption payments.
The facilities have now been well preserved in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the free hostages were in the obbout of the German message.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, there was no information when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Image" section, the five holidayers and the special forces are to be evacuated by an airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has made the 700 billion-dollar heavy rescue package almost impossible for financial markets.
The Dow Jones burst into the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of the two parties, there was no majority for the program with which the chaos should be introduced to the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters were desperate to convince the critics of the heavy package of the 700 billion dollars.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on the MPs to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition to avoid something that has not yet occurred," he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones broke in by more than six percent or 600 points.
There were reasons for concern among the investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, in order to then, after being informed of the failure, to cancel again.
Experts now rely on other heavy turbulences on the international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary for the entry into force of the programme.
Organizers list increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales in comparison to the previous year have increased significantly according to a study - even for the winter season by more than 30 percent.
Despite poor economic prospects, the Germans’ travel experience remains unattainable.
In the winter season bookings, the travel agencies recorded a sales surplus of 31 per cent over the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study of the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking rates for the autumn months.
Thus, the sales plus of the travel offices for October amounted to about 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV shared.
The basis for these results is GfK figures that evaluate monthly booking data from 1200 German travel offices and high for the total market.
This includes the travel bookings made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the low dollar rate, in particular travel to the United States was requested, the DRV shared.
Here the booking growth is about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic fleet, were particularly requested destinations for the Germans.
Special holiday trips are high in the course, DrV President Klaus Laepple explained.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, here the costs are "better calculated for customers than for individually organised holidays".
Consumers could save money by, inter alia, early book discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that the previous year would again be a sales plus - although according to a further study the number of Germans who took a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first time October party
Ballermann-Apres-Ski hits in the endless loop, beer from liters and promises in designer-Dirndln.
A wisn debüt.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, television moder and wears a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, connects us: Almost three minutes on the display, the photographers are already crashing on us and cutting the memory cards full - very funny and that on my first tour.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the Whitewaterstäquator, the feeling of well-being remained in touch until then in borders.
But once you arrived on the terrace, it's all half so bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no eye directed or painfully touched - everything completely normal.
Strange views at the chocolate stand only pick up my shirts.
A monk would point out that I had wrongly bound the scarf: "Links hoast free, middle young woman, forgive right, behind whitewash."
Heavenly, I'm pulling the rails from the back to the left.
"Excuse me," he said and laughed.
Others make less effort to subtle flirting techniques and wear light filter gloves on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and extends an unscrupulous tip against the naked back.
The young man with the exhibitionist assassinations is called Bob, who comes from England and also visits the October party for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long drawn "oooo".
He tells me that after he's exhausted his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, from which everyone thinks he's a muzzler.
So Bob's one of those notorious wild boobs.
Others do not have the happiness of releasing alcohol in this way.
On the other hand, at eight o'clock in the evening Sanitaries in Scharen run over the hard spot that needs to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the wheelchair - every four to one fold a covered coat of tent to tent.
This works like with most of the Wiesn visitors: empty, completely back.
You can't see who's in the Promille Sarg under the plan.
"These are the ones that pack goarnimmers," one of the sanitizers called me on request and disappeared in the dust.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in a hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, a resident of the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at the Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romeford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of his suspicion of light driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey extends the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, the European authorities were interested in bringing deep into Turkey's backyard.
On the east side of the Bosporus, perhaps just once 20 steps within Asia, one of the finest relics of this broken, imperial effort.
The Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo Renaissance style.
That's at least what the tour guide tells you.
The building is facings at the end of the train path with a tower on each corner of the front and it looks like some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart.
But if you are once inside the waved ticket switch, there is no doubt about the presence of the event, whose most Western access was this.
The train station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolie-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany's imperialist plans came to light during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence by Arabs and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the unsurpassed limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces drove out of Egypt and forced the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917, a munitions pull flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was Saturday.
Since then, it has slowly collapsed, largely passed by history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and all east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Tukei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now a policy of approximation prevails.
Significantly, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian split groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and with the European Union and the United States of America of course.
In order to assess the echoes of this new foreign policy, I have decided to go to the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a slow ride on bricks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city, for the new world state project, the Ottoman past to return to its back.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity
This has triggered some mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi brought me to the AKP headquarters, a specially developed, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-finished shopping centers and knots in which middle managers, both men and women, met to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-law politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Dress up, Krawatte, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Today, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There wasn't either one or the other.
She had to do both.
"But of course Turkey could at some time," I asked, "were you forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "didn't want to make this decision."
He then raised a point that almost everyone I spoke to here said almost routinely: the relations of Turkey, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems as if the message could, in the transferred sense, drive Europe as a whole towards Asia and the Middle East on the same railways.
Back to Hydarpashas Railway Station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German lords Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had seen this construction 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, too far, lie in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting for the ferry to return to the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At the time, at least there seemed to be little doubt about which continent should have a claim on this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962 Vernon was "dead" Handley (neighbor on September 11th) responsible for Guildford Philharmonic and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, proteus the following year.
He was thought of young people up to 21 years of age, but when the choir last sang in 1979, some of us were already late 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape changer) was to attack the readiness and ability of the choir, any music that was presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young Chores was often amazing, always exciting and stood alone thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that has never been left behind over the years.
How often death kept us to "let the music speak for ourselves".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So it sings!"
His kind of leadership was absolutely clear and precise, but never did he get over it.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any leader had hit the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, where he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I have written criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He denounced the leaders who, according to his words, simply went home with one or two well-known sheep victims in the world.
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your reference to William Woodruff (September 25th), you write that "in 1946 he took over the teaching of economic history in Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship ... while studying at the same time for a BSc, a MA and a doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from an author's comment in Woodruff's book "Alsoside of Nab End", however, it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University and during this time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published as the "British rubber industry" in 1958.
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 on the course of a Hoblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to miss this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological Faculty.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me pay attention to them because of their weakness and because of the power they emit, how they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magic moments.'
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda begins marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large inner room, this large-space limousine offers an even greater size.
The technical fines that make driving and fuel even more comfortable will also be available.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
So is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically, the new Jazz has shown a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made to these large limbs are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be highlighted.
However, before you start to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda was able to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon regarding its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where the Jazz is the most sold car in 2002 and also in 2008.
After Jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold alone in Japan.
The second market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10 000 cars. This is 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 jazz models since 2002. These are 6,7% of the total sales to Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the managers of the branches in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 Jazz models per year.
More precisely, it allows the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model to obscure sales in Spain.
In fact, the brand leaders hope to complete the year with total sales of 22,000 models. These are 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this sales growth, Honda has increased its market share in Spain compared to the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda puts on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters long, the Japanese company expects to sell around 200 000 models a year around the world.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50 % of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, for the first time his public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is, on the one hand, due to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the forward model of Jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a system of the double load area, also reaches up to 339 litres, so 19 litres larger than the capacity of the first generation.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the Honda Jazz trunk with a 1.2 litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except for additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility to build Panorama windows, improved access to the seats is provided.
The opening angle of the rear door is 80 degrees, with the first Jazz only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1,2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance, and at the same time provides torque-resistant performance for the entire engine life.
The first variant with 1.2 litres achieves the performance of 90 PS at 6,000 spins with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min ?1 .
This petrol engine - the forward model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 PS in the previous generation, it is now able to reach 100 PS.
The jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litre of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-Bien', which avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot, whose flight back to the narrowness of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the technical development centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed these small robots in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, BR23C is an extension of the four-dimensional Nissan security sign.
This robot should ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own, oval-shaped flight, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the faces of the bees that can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows them to fly uninterruptedly in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to imitate the Rundu perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles that are in front of the BR23C in the distance up to two meters and are in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a border-based microprocessor, which is immediately translated into a signal to prevent collision
`At the moment, when the obstacle is noticed, the small robot will copy the bee flight and immediately change the direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angle to avoid collision.
The greatest difference to any other system is that this exchangeover takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it wasn't so, then the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can not go up or down, but can also not cross; it can move only on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in an infinite way how it makes bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions to avoid collisions by the small robot.
`This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and act on these data.
It does not require the storage of the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers made, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in developing technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan will introduce in the next ten years in the series cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and hold longer than the variety of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to drive to the target and avoid obstacles on the way.
She's at the seat before she's loaded with a mortgage.
It must be noted that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to support it, but it is not without its power.
Before the crisis and in order to prevent US citizens from developing mortgage stories of allegedly paying banks, a fun and informative game was developed for Internet surfers: `Bad Credit Hotel', it means.
Or maybe the 'Hotel of Bad Credits' or the 'Central Credits'.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to consider one, two and three times whether it is the moment to ask no credit.
And above all, where one can do it, which is probably also the goal of the game.
She certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is a page for the teens rather than a place for all viewers.
What will happen when the game is extended?
Well, if a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides her capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into his company, so that this would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a renewal that is due to a strong fall in its stock exchange rate.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made publicly, the two banks explained that MUFG 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock shares will be purchased at a single price of $25.25, which represents a total amount of $3 billion.
The accepted price is below 19% of the share's price from 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares that will guarantee a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business will be carried out on the basis of a single average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price.
However, Morgan Stanley's share fell to 17.00 GMT by 6.79% to $23.07.
`This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank," explained John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley has adopted this status last week, which should allow him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Its connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: last Monday Morgan had simply stated that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
`A week ago', Toshihiide Mizuno, managing director of the MFG, declared that the participation would be entirely based on tribal property.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and ensure ourselves.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below their price for their Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business is going to pay off about 20% per share with a reduction in profit.
The agreement provides that in one year the MFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into shares if the latter are exchanged within a given period of more than 50% above the sales value, i.e. about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his sales.
However, a press speaker in the group refused to make more precise information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that his balance sheet had been down since the end of August `clear'.
The last few weeks were hard for the group, who had to see their stock exchange rate falling by half, while the price for insurance against incapacity to pay was high.
This price went back on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only remaining 'survivor' of the large investment banks on the Wall Street after the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers competition and the purchase of Merril Lynch, announced that last week, $15 billion, in part at Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group, had been cancelled.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic of the 21st century is re-established around socialism.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, of the Bolivian Evo Morales and of the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Jener third was the one who, following this Sunday, followed the example of his peers and friends, put the plan of a new constitution to the vote.
The mission met, because according to the public results of the vote of 80% of the voters, 64% of the votes were in the referendum with `Yes'.
According to these results, 28% agreed with 'No', 7% of the electoral lists were invalid and 0.7% were left empty.
In order to adopt the draft Constitution, a vote must be reached more than half of all the votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted on the outcome of the Wahlokale and a census of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for 'Yes', and 63% to 70% prophesied.
On Sunday night on Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The `Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers south-west of Quito, assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election held in silence in accordance with the observation of the Organization of the American States (OAS) referred to a text of 444 points in order to secure the 'new socialism' for which the President is taking the lead.
The constitutional project transfers government to the economy by transferring it to a country with the sole right to 'development planning', which most of all lives from the promotion of oil by foreign companies and from foreign currencies, sending the displaced to the country.
The project, which will be preceded by the 2006 Correa, will also provide the Head of State with more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of every four years, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he will use this power and that a new mandate will be sought in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in that country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also foresees banning the presence of foreign troops, which will provide an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an equatorial support point as a starting point for American drug use.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts, who were kept trapped in the desert for 11 days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this afternoon healthy and unhindered.
In the morning they were released from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, at 3.30 p.m., the hostages reached the military base of al-Maza right next to the international airport of Cairo on board a special aircraft.
They were brought directly, without being able to speak with the press, on board a helicopter to Maadi's hospital, a foreign district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They were happy with all the 'best health' and the kidnapper 'was not paid a ransom', Egyptian Minister Zoheir Garanna explained on the roll.
After she was arrested on 19 September at a safari camp at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was again brought from 35 unknown exiles from a hiding place.
It is about eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency of Egypt, the organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from the board of two helicopters, had launched the attack at night, just before the morning break.
`On both sides fallen shots and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,' said this responsible, who wanted to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian specialities were sent to Sudan, where they received support through German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is located, on the role played by the secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men by secret service and by the special units," he explained without further details.
He also argues that a ransom was paid.
On the night before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a landing vehicle on a patrol, where the kidnappers were found, six of whom, including the leader from Chad, killed and two prisoners.
The army stated that they were in contact with a rebel group from Darfur, the Liberian Sudan-Unite movement (SLA-U), which is immediately opposed to this movement.
Letters - The quiet majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is a milestone and is a central theme of the current electoral struggle.
That's better.
But a field of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and raise the abysmal sums that are given to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
Which politicians will dare to remind the federal government that they neglect their monuments and their culturally important buildings?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides EUR 3.5 million alone for the restoration of the Chinon Castle in Loiretal?
Our American neighbours have written in their country's constitution that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all deputies and all government districts, in mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the union of the historical societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 dignitaries gathered in 211 historical societies strive to deal intensively with history, with a few groceries to save the numerous private archives, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, who protest with the strength of despair when supporters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten free holes.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux government government parts of the Fortis Bank
With a partial settlement, the Benelux States of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been hit by the US financial crisis in Turbulence, wish to seize the poor: the three states provide the Bank and Insurance Institute, which also has a total of EUR 11.2 billion in the rest of Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted the European Commission's competition authorities at the highest level at the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition authority.
In the Eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial crisis that has been ongoing for a year, so decisions that are now taken in connection with the Bank could have a precedent.
Within the meaning of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three countries purchase the respective shares of the bank at about 49 per cent.
The Bank will probably sell part of its shares, all of the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Last week, the Fortis shares have begun a steep speech ride, which in the second half of the week already marked serious crisis scenarios.
However, analysts agree that the bank is too large for a job with its 85,000 employees.
The Institute's securities fell to a 14-year-old depth on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has dropped by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock exchange rate, the market value of the group amounts to EUR 14 billion, which, according to management, is unrealistic.
According to management, the USD 700 billion expensive American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty on the markets was due to the speech of the Fortis shares.
However, on Monday the courses have increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director General of the Bank.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but there was no interest in a business offer.
The Belgian government was trying to calm down - no prosecutor was supposed to spend his money, it was called.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the bank's branches have not been shaken.
In Hungary, the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls its own leasing companies.
Fuchs in Hungry Stalt
Because of the drug consumption of a person, in America, life and health insurance often refuses to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that link the use of drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in an independent hand, otherwise we trust the Hühner to the Fuch" - the Washington Post Richard Dick, a developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance determines the fees and payments in the event of damage depending on the health condition of the customer, and should be considered too high, the insurance will not be completed.
Previously, the customer was sent to a medical investigation, and the contract was concluded only in the light of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago Dick found a much cheaper method: based on the customer's identification number, he refers to the data of the last one and a half years of the pharmacies, the languages that have been bought, and the program calculates on which disease the customer suffers and how his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol lowering drugs, it was followed by that his blood fat level is untreated, which would automatically be selected in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurance has to do more than the paper cream, however there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as migration and heat fluctuations, but also depression.
The latter is a high risk factor in the view of the insurers, while the above mentioned ones are not.
For the purpose of data collection and processing, own societies have formed which, before they relate to the data, ask patients for their consent.
In the meantime, they must do so by law, although there have not yet been delays.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory investigations and link them to the data on drug consumption, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data and control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a personal data protection law for health data, its effect extends only to health services and insurance.
The draft legislation has already been submitted to the Congress, which allows the authorities to control data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be transmitted with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly prevent access to his data, since the insurance does not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And so the hens are left just a little bit of the grace of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this was the main issue in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, too, the French-Industrial Summit is taking place, which focuses mainly on cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
However, the European Union recognises that India is an ambitious, democratic power that should be given more votes and rights of co-operation in international affairs, yet Member States have not yet been able to agree on whether or not to support the permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to increase to a fine of EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that trade between 2000 and 2007 rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this respect, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally incorporated into an agreement, so that air traffic will also be endorsed in the future.
By 2009 India wanted to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to create a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is the number one India partner, New Delhi is only among the nine EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global affairs.
Among these were the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, namely terrorism, which condemned both sides to the strongest, and the convening of a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides liable for the failure.
The EU stressed that it adheres to its energy and climate programme, which means that emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, as with the proposal, to conclude a kind of global compromise at the coming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 per cent by 2050.
The rise in prices for food should also be combated and both support the convening of an international conference on the subject of the financial crisis.
Today, the head of the Indian Government is visiting the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris we hope for orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency's reports, the Agreement is to be concluded at 15 years' time.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th fair, the most important international event for the right-wing.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair is expected for the current event of over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will be distributed over the 171.790 square meters of the fair and will present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the most honored of the event.
The Undersecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Property and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will be represented by the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 sqm large exhibition room Punto Italia.
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: figures, trends and perspectives around the publishing industry in Italy are discussed on this occasion.
According to the data, the importance of books of foreign writers is assumed in the whole, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
The small plane of the billionaire Steve Fosset recovered a year ago
The small plane of Steve Fossett, which was discovered on 3 September 2007 on a flight across the desert of Nevada, was discovered.
The parts were found on a 3000 m high plateau, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, completely confirmed the latest doubts during a press conference: "The aircraft has been located, on which a body has been sent. Now we have the confidence that it is the aircraft with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Bureau of Transport Safety (Ntsb) announced that a team had been deployed a few hours after the flight was sighted, which identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab that was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fosset in Yerington in Nevada was launched for a 3-hour flight.
Finally, yesterday, too, in California, not far from the border to Nevada, some of the personal objects of Fossett were found by a couple near her home at the Mammoth Lakes.
This is about two demonstrations with the name Fossets, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fosset was abandoned one month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history by a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he was the first person to cross the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, single flight.
Three years later he circled the world in a single flight without landing with a plane.
Among its several records is an altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andes, however, this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising that you don't expect
A suv, which comes from its original design and the special line management, the exhausting surface and its clear angle from the conventional schemata.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to boost the sector's new breath with this off-roader.
Especially because of its exceptional features will the presentation of the Suv Glk be unconventional, which will be seen in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from October 17th.
Thus, the advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also take place in new clothing, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a new feature in the car sector in the rest of Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out by Corso Como until 15 November in different stages, which will take place in Milan's central shopping mile.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new suv will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will seem to stand out from the poster on which it is depicted.
This will be illuminated by the Elumina8 technology of the new glk at different times in all its details to recompose itself as a whole.
Without a doubt it is the concern of Mercedes with this advertisement to introduce a new type of authoric ad in this rather stereotype field.
But will it be possible to travel the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it's clear who the Italian Hooligans are.
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls for whom all of Italy is ashamed now? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been travelling behind the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, has not caused any serious problems until recently.
It never came to conflict with rival fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The sponsors came from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia were included in Sofia.
They wear the tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: however, they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Your models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a conflict with a truly radical phenomenon of law, that of Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fans were given 144 cards for the game: all were displayed on names and therefore easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those traveling to Sofia, no one was with a running stadium ban.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already pre-loaded in this regard, were also refused the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the Bulgarian police reports to start further steps: in this case, the typhosi identified or identified at the outbreaks can be counted with a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums across Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But of course, there are fears of copycats who could follow these little more than 150.
"This fire must be released immediately, and this does not in any case give the opportunity to justify such behaviour," it says from the Viminal.
That's why, "look at the game of the national team at Lecce on Wednesday."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sport Guard) gathers together on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, that is, the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the right arm raised during Mameli's Hymne? In Bulgaria this is no punishment..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed clearly without joy), who has been the director of the Observatory on Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was former police president of Trieste, where a core of the 2002-based Ultras Italia is now established.
It is true, Mazzilli says that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the duce, but undoubtedly the conduct of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist – adding the number 1 of the observatory – crimes are committed in the country of their action.
So far, this group has been in the mood, but now it has to be considered what has happened and will happen.
But we're also talking about the peppers during the Mamelis Hymne: this is not a punishment, but let me, there's no education...".
