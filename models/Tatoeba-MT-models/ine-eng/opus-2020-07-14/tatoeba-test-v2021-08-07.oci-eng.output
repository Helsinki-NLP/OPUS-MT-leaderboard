Let's get this better.
Let's get out of here.
I'll warm you up and thank you.
It's gone to the wheel.
The sauna sounds that are very true.
And it's too long.
That you seem to love the rat.
I'll keep you safe.
It's time to stay on the roof.
Let me tell you the truth.
It's too late for the Tribal.
They hit the tub.
That you'll have to study me hard the year I come.
