The members of the Assembly (AM, for their English-language stamps) of Wales are concerned about "punching muppets"
Some members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to members of the Gales Parliament (MWP, for their English-language stamps).
This dissertation arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Gales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of all political spectrum are concerned that this can be ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly stated that his group was concerned about "remaining with Twp and Pwp".
For readers from outside Wales: In Wales, twp means dumb and pwp means lame.
A member of the Assembly of the Gales Party commented that the whole group was "discontented" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Gales Conservative Party stated that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the MWP-muppet speech jump was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter or in Yorkshire English.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change of name, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the members of the Assembly will be the subject of the members themselves."
The Gales Government Act 2017 gave the Gales Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals that revealed broad support for calling the Gales Parliament to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of the members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred members of the Wales Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option obtained most of the support in a public consultation.
The members of the Assembly seem to be suggesting alternative options, but the struggle for consensus could lead to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the draft law on changes in a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the inability of members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word in the question of how they should be called when deciding on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on the country's name change
The voters will vote on Sunday whether the name of their country will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was convened in an attempt to resolve a decade-long conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its North Neighbor is a claim from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's President, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the change of name, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, the referendum participants, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The campaigns of San Martín keep silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the older people I've spoken to say there was a bar and a church on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's nothing or the other."
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"Now socialist people in another way," he says.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which the neighbors go regularly."
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "before or after, they will return to the point of departure".
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments full of people who will not help the shrines that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and therefore they will speed up the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who change to these apartments will end up being members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and San Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation was formed in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation that served as a servant of Jehovah purchased the building.
A black congregation took the ruins of San Martín, under the direction of Lieutenant John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to street merchants 125, a main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building seriously damaged and while the happys of Father Johnson made plans for his reconstruction, they also carried the wagon.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martin, proudly called him "the campaigns of the poor."
In July, the expert who played the carriage called "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, at the University of Michigan, pointed out that it was the first carriage of the world used by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who went to play the carriage of Riverside Church, of greater size, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martín in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by the secular leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of parishioners, composed of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting its concern that the diocese "is trying to pass the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some happy people complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tiburón is a 13-year-old boy who was looking for langostas in California
A shark attacked and chased a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was looking for langotas in California on the day the langotas season was opened, according to the authorities.
The attack occurred shortly before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed the San Diego KSWB-TV channel that he had been running with friends for a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was only excited to have caught a languid, but then he realized that "he was shouting that he had been bitten by them
default:mm
He had the wrecked clavicle," observed Hammel when he arrived at the boy's side.
"I cried to everyone who came out of the water because there was a shark," Hammel added.
The child was transported by helicopter to the Children Council Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented on a press wheel that had seen a shark in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed trauma injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, Casablanca, to Swami Beach, Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans drive the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the corridors of their style and beauty facilities.
In order to significantly boost the UK's beauty market, valued at 2800 billion pounds and with an increasing growth compared to the downturn in fashion and home handling sales, the largest beauty corridors will be tested in 11 shops throughout the country and, if they succeed, will do the same in the most shops next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this chain of supermarkets seeks ways to use space in booths that were used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its beauty offer with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also resume its range of Boutique makeup with a majority of products that respect animals, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In the perfumery The Fragrance Shop will also prove its concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments, the first newly opened in Croydon, in southern London, last week. The second will be opened in Sely Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shops and the change to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local stores force supermarkets to strive to convince people that they are visiting them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that shops will increasingly appear to commercial centers while the supermarket chain tries to combat Aldi and Lidl discount facilities by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has integrated sale points of Argo's discounts into hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have stimulated sales of edible and profitable these acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to renew its departments of beauty and pharmacies was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in early 2000, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide the revenues of pharmaceutical sales points into its supermarkets.
The new strategy is set up after the sale of the 281 pharmaceutical establishments from Sainsbury to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sainsbury's commented: "We have transformed the appearance and the environment of our beauty corridors so that they can the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to offer advice.
Our brand offer is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location makes us an irresistable destination of beauty products, challenging the old way to buy."
Peter Jones is "suffering" after Holly Willoughby breaks an agreement of 11 million pounds.
Peter Jones, the Dragon's Den star, was "furished" after the TV show Holly Willoughby broke an agreement of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle business line to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to the fashion brand and True plugins.
This business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of this Morning announced he was abandoning the business in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the Dragon's Den star, by abandoning his lucrative life-style business in the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "furnished" when the TV gold girl admitted that her new agreements, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time to dedicate himself to True, her brand of fashion and complements, during a tight meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was profiled as a favourite to duplicate Willoughby's fortune, about 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced that he was leaving the business in Instagram, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: "Truly was, by contrast, Holly's main priority.
It was going to be its long-term future, which would keep it in the next two decades.
His decision to abandon all those who were fully involved in it left.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters, ready to be put to the sale."
Experts believe that the release of this Morning presenter, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions because of the important investment in products that go from kitchens and candles to clothes, and possibly delay even more their launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children, and ten years ago they have a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president in March.
The couples went on holiday together and Jones had a 40% share in the Baldwin television producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program on the ITV channel.
A source close to Jones claimed that last night, "it was not about business issues."
A difficult conversation "and then we fall in love"
He was joking about the criticisms he received from the media by making a comment that some would consider "unpresidative" and that he was so positive about the Norwegian leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump commented with his burlon's voice of "presenter of news".
"I haven't given up on anything."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in seeing him again after Trump was commended for the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which considered a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations for denuclearization, however, have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country did not see a "adequate response" from the United States at the first steps towards North Korea's disarmament.
On the contrary, he noted that the US continues to apply sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his half.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
They would have killed millions of people.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have generated positive results: the end of tests with missiles, help to free hostages and bring the remains of American soldiers back home.
He also defended his unusual approach when talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but so, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this full stage, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump commented, pointing out the people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and a earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population in Lombok had had to move, there was no national emergency, a prior requirement to catalyse international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, which complicates things a little," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children are preparing a team that will send to Palu, they are not sure whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of the national emergency agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
In view of the constant movement of the land in Indonesia, the country is still incredibly little prepared when nature withdraws its anger.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been built in Aceh, there are not so many in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami alerts in Palu, even though there was a previous warning, has contributed to the loss of life.
In the best case, traveling from one Indonesian island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the key to the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo has converted the improvement of Indonesia's waste infrastructure into the central axis of his electoral campaign, and has allocated a lot of money to railways and lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr. Joko's administration, which is facing a re-election next year.
In addition, it must face the pressure of persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while gangs of Christians and Muslims were fighting in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equals the marker before Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the First League in front of Chelsea with a goal in minute 89 on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri to some more than 27 metres from Chelsea's porter when the marker was 1-0.
He placed the balloon on his left foot with a touch before he threw it to the second pole.
The action sent him over the area and directed to the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the balloon passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop it with a jump and fell on the net.
"He was trying to put me in that position to do me with the ball and the players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give me all the time," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante was approaching and touched him. I didn't think too much, I just threw the shot."
Chelsea was going to win 1-0 in the first half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard marked a goal in minute 25.
The midpoint of the Blues made a tacón pass to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning around by a stream near the midfield and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the balloon and ran out in the middle of the field.
Then he made a nice pass to the space that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard sat in front of the defense and finished throwing the balloon at the network of the second post with a patata with the left foot that Alison Becker, from Liverpool, could not stop.
On Wednesday at 3 p.m., Liverpool plays against Naples in the group phase of the Champions League. The meeting will be held at the St. Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
For its part, Chelsea faces Videoton in UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of Tsunami victims in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunami victims in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country's emergency agency at the first hour of Sunday.
Many people were trapped among the ruins of the buildings that collapsed during the magnitude earthquake of 7,5 that occurred on Friday and that left a wave of up to six meters, as reported the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press wheel.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with remains of the ruined buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with fists at Grayson Mews, John Street, which subjected the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the initial stages, but it would encourage anyone who was close to Jonh Street in Birkenhead, and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend to any person, especially taxi drivers, who could have caught something in Dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is Birkenhead and found within a property.
This afternoon, some people who believe in knowing women came to the scene of the crime to know where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his apartment, but the police tell him that no one can come in or get out of the building.
He was confused when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now informed that they will be allowed to enter again in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
Don't stop saying, "It's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents were standing inside the cord controlling the floor block.
Any person who has information to send a mail to DM @MerPolCC is requested to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously in the number 0800 555 111, register 247 of September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statue becomes the last commemorative success for "rewrite history"
Its ban would be a poetic act of justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as a "lost" and a "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current discussion on the elimination of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster became a goal.
The iconoclasty of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
It may be sacrificed to Cromwell mistakenly by the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of the history of a figure that many consider worthy to celebrate.
As Mr Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than at present, a defender of Parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, the monarchy is clear.
If this is a completely precise description, it is a question of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th-century middle-century conflict has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebrating and commemorating."
A killer pig attacks a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his so-called "Yuan", was found dead with a sectioned and blood-covered artery close to a handful of the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, as South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig breeder is prepared to inject vaccines into the pigs of a pig in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pouch was open.
He said there was a big pig in the pouch with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig of almost 250 kilograms had attacked the livestock until death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and destroyed," said the cousin, to whom they addressed his name, "Wu," to The Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera images showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager informed The Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent anyone from attacking anyone else, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
It seems that the Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although it's rare, it's not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in his Massachusetts farm, leaving a man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 295 pounds had reached a farmer in his tractor until his wife was frightened by the animal.
After that in 2012, some pigs were eaten by a Oregón farmer, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "disposer".
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What you have to do is have proper respect for them," he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane will leave strong generalized rains in the southwestern United States.
As expected, the Rosa hurricane is weakening as it moves over the coolest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains throughout the north of Mexico and south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa caused wind cracks of more than 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane from Sunday to the five in the morning (East Time) and was located almost 620 kilometres south-west of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean they are beginning to generate low pressures, which are moving in the direction east towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the intense tropical rains in the north, toward the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain strikes with the low pressure that is approaching, there will be strong generalized precipitation in the south-west over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, streams of debris and possible spills in the desert.
The intense tropical rains will cause precipitations of almost 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rains, sudden floods may occur with conditions that quickly deteriorate.
For this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended at all to venture in the desert by foot.
Strong rains could turn cannons into embriled rivers and storms will cause locally torn winds and dust clouds.
Low pressures approaching will leave strong rains in concrete parts of the southern coast of California.
The torrential rains may leave up to nearly two centimeters of water, which could cause small streams of debris and cause the roads to be resbald.
This would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical chaplains will begin to approach Arizona at the last hour of Sunday and the first hour of Monday, before the rain generalizes at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rains will spread to the Four Equines on Tuesday and throughout the Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic and the heat of the tropics can be observed.
Sometimes this involves drastic temperature changes in short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout the U.S. center on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of the summer will try to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the centre and east of the U.S. is expected a warm beginning of October, with generalized temperatures that will range from 26 degrees from the South Lanura to parts of the northeastern.
On Tuesday, in New York, temperatures could reach up to 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probability of temperatures above average for the east of the United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's presence
More than 20 million people followed the dissident testimony that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, gave Thursday in six television chains.
Meanwhile, politics continued to be dead, and the media interrupted their usual programming to retransmit the latest Friday news: an agreement designed by Senator Jeff Blake, to get the FBI to carry out an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Commission that he had absolute certainty that Kavanaugh had touched her as an alcoholic and that he had tried to take her to a party.
During his passionate witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that was not what happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen had seen it on Friday.
The company accounted for the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that transmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems to calculate how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is a hearing similar to that of an American football party of the playoffs or the Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose Tertullians have strongly supported the designation of Kavanaugh, fueled the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during an appearance that lasted all day, Nielsen noted.
ABC occupied second place, with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen commented.
After the incident, there was still a great interest.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the Office of the moderate Republican issued a statement informing that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras caught up on Friday morning how some demonstrators yelled at him when he tried to go up to an elevator to attend a meeting with the Judicial Commission.
While receiving these complaints, transmitted directly by the CNN, it was shown to be abated.
"Looking at my face," said one woman.
"Do you think you're telling the truth to the country?"
And he went on, "You have power when there are many women who don't have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a notice and, before the elevator doors closed, that he would have more information in his presence before the Commission.
The cable and radio television channels broadcast everything to him directly hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate to vote on it.
However, Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated charges against the candidate during the next week, which had been requesting some Democrats.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
The Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics with his plan to leave the European Union to "make politics" with the future of Britain and undermine national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, comes to the Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published next to her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on her attack on the alleged Chequers Plan for the Brexit, stating that a proposal for Britain and the EU to cover each other's tariffs was "totally absurd".
Wayde's murder: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, has been arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made a video of the Sims-Simpson confrontation, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the hostages in the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to WAFB, CBS's subsidiary.
After questioning Simpson, the police say they admitted to shooting Wayde.
A loan of USD 350 000 has been established, according to the defence.
The Baton Rouge District Instruction Court issued a preliminary report on Friday that indicated that the cause of death had been a bullet wound in the neck that had reached the head.
The Department recognizes the merits of the Luisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the South University Police and its citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, the sports director of LSU, thanked the police forces in the area for their "diligence and search for justice".
Yess was 20 years old.
The player, who was more than two meters old, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball in LSU.
He had obtained an average of 5,6 points and 2,6 turns in a last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU's basketball coach, said his team is "damaged" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"These are the things people are always worried about," Wade said.
A ashesy volcano in Mexico City
Censorship from the Volcano Popocatepetl has reached the neighborhoods located south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas and ashes in 24 hours.
The center recorded a number of earthquakes and earthquakes.
On social networks, the images showed fine layers of ashes covering the vehicle parabrises in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have observed a greater activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after independent protesters faced the riots while thousands of people participated in opposition demonstrations coincided with the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized referendum on secession.
A group of separatists who had been cut off by the anti-disturbs threw eggs and dust painting, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
There were also post-hour clashes, and the police used bullets to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independent groups, with messages like "no forgotten nor forgiveness", faced unionist protesters with the cry of "Viva España".
Forty people were assisted by mild injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
The tensions remained high in this region one year after the vote of 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters chose, by the overwhelming majority, independence, although the participation was low, since those who opposed the secession had largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police attempted to prevent the vote at electoral tables throughout the region, where violent clashes occurred.
The independence groups camped on Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The event continued, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although close, in the regional elections last December, the pro-Catalanist parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders, whether in self-taxed or detained exile, are awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been initiated by politicians on both sides.
"If you're getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive prison since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the return to democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for embellishing a house with a car
Three men, from 33, 34 and 39 years of age, have been arrested after repeated stabbing a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident took place on Thursday at 19:30 in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that damage was caused to access and to the building itself.
At some point, you may have shot the car with a bullet.
A Menga attack gives the Livingston 1-0 victory against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
A promoted Livingstone impressed the Rangers when they won the second victory for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as a coach of the Ibrox Club.
The attack by Dolly Menga marked the difference. Gary Holt's men went to a position, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard's men have not yet won any victory out of the house, and next Sunday they face Hearts, the leaders of the table with eight points of advantage.
Earlier, the Rangers received Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the League of Europe.
Meanwhile, Livingstone has expanded its race of victories in the six-party division. Holt, the master coach, has not yet tasted the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lets you pass opportunities in front of a prospective visitor
Holt's team had to have gone a step ahead long before marking, causing all kinds of problems to the Rangers for their direct game.
Scott Robinson went through the defense, but failed his attempt at portership. Then Alan Lithgow pulled the shot away after entering to finish Craig Halkett's head center in front of the porter.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors with standing ball games.
That's how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston sought an entry, with a combined game from Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who struck the balloon and marked it from the center of the area.
At that time, the Rangers dominated possession, but they could not pass the defense of the host and the porter, Liam Kelly, was quite quiet.
That game continues until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Allan McGregor, the Rangers' porter, rejected a shot by Scott Pittman from a trap, and Lithgow stayed away from another liveston game.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly entered, but they were always cleared. Two requests for penalty were rejected, one after a Halket's entry on the alternate Glenn Middleton and the other by one hand.
Livingston's Phenomenal (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to surpass the expectations of an upward trajectory.
Your game style and your template have only experienced changes since your ascension, but this is largely due to Holt because it has strengthened the team since its arrival.
He was with a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was enormous and directed a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerrard, they were short.
They failed to materialize the games, as they only got into the opposite field once, which is a call of attention to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguity in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO's allies.
They discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open up a huge new mix.
The city welcomes the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many fellows were in the immediate position to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurdish, were also heard, condemning both the policies of Erdogan and the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
These manifestations reflect the division that this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist falls after collision with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the Cross of Beswokd Street and Evelyn Street, a competing road from Deptford, to the south-east of the city, at 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was cared for by the paramedics, but he failed there.
The accident occurs after another cyclist dies after being hit by a vehicle that ran away on Childers Street, almost two kilometers from the site of the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut off and buses have been diverted, and drivers who avoid the area have been advised.
Long Lartin Prison: six agents injured after some disturbances
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation produced in a high-security prison for men, according to the Prison Centre Directorate.
The disturbances began in Long Lartin's prison, in Worcestershire, at 9:30 a.m. and still continued.
An elite team specialists (called "Tordo") are in charge of controlling the altercations, including eight internal participants and affecting a pavilion.
The agents received assistance for slight facial injuries on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison department commented: "The prison staff has been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident of Long Lartin's prison.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated, and let us make it clear that the officers will be put in the hands of the police and could spend more time between bars."
Long Lartin prison welcomes more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, anti-disruption agents were asked to go to prison to deal with a serious altercation in which they attacked the prison staff with billiards.
The Rosa hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the arid areas could be benefited)
It is not common for tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of the week that comes when the last collections of the Rosa hurricane cross the south-west of the desert, at the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued alerts for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in west Arizona, south and east of Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to be directed directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rains at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service commented on a tweet that only "ten hurricanes have preserved their tropical storm or depression on a 321-kilometre Phoenix radio since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached almost 65 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the Hurricane National Centre provide between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rains, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollon Scarpe in Arizona.
It is likely that they fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the south-west of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Grand Cuenca.
In places that do not run the risk of sudden flooding, the rains of Rosa can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious matter, it is likely that part of these torrential rains will be beneficial due to the drought conditions that are currently experiencing in the south-west.
According to the United States Sequential Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported in weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rosa route will take over the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum rifles of 136 kilometres per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north to 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing power.
Thus, it is expected to rise in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm during the afternoon of Monday.
Strong torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which run a considerable risk of flooding.
"There are some torrential rains between 7 and 15 centimeters from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching the 25 centimeters", as reported in weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the first hours of the morning of Tuesday as a tropical depression. Later, she will move through Arizona to the south of Utah at the last hour of the night of Tuesday.
"The main danger of Rosa or her remains is the strong torrential rain in Baja California, the north-west of Sonora and the south-west of the U.S. desert," notes the U.S. National Centre of Hurricane.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden floods and streams of debris in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects of an attempted murder after another 16-year-old had been found with white gun injuries in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, at 4:00 p.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remained "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-and-one 20-year-olds were arrested that same night in Radstock, Avon, according to the Somerset Police.
Agents have called on anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the mosque and anger" of the Democratic Party
"Vowing in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the dissatisfaction and angry tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a myth celebrated in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the mosque and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified to the Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that that day, the "United States saw the wisdom, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"Vowing to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most successful lawyers of our day, a lawyer with an amazing history of public service," he told his followers from West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy when discussing the importance of Republican participation in the half-term elections.
"Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't present myself, but it's a race," he said.
"That's why I'm going from place to place fighting to get big candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be held not later than Friday, he reported a high position of the leadership of the Republican Party to the CNN.
Hundreds of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the figure is increasing
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the huge waves that devastated the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at night, dragging many to death and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When yesterday was warned that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they were victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) of Indonesia, said in a press wheel in Yakarta.
"The tsunami did not arrive alone, dragged cars, trunks, houses, shook everything on the ground," Nugroho commented. The tsunami had moved by the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He added that some people had gone up to the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, bridges broken down and broken down, and a mixed water.
The replicas continued to strike the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) reported in a statement that energy released by the great earthquake of Friday was 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels had been destroyed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the ruined buildings. In addition, 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho pointed out that the number of victims and damage could be greater over 300 km of coast to the north of Palu, a zone called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and there was no information" from Dongala, Nugroho commented.
"There are more than 300,000 people living," said the Red Cross in a communiqué, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy for itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism because it did not report that a tsunami had struck Palu, although the managers said the waves had already arrived at the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by a fan and shared on social networks, a man who was on the last floor of a building is heard warning people who were on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a water wall hits the coast, taking up buildings and cars.
Reuters could not validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great deal of shock that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began to send cargo planes with aid from Yakarta and other cities, the authorities declared, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic products.
The city airport has been reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims by Indonesia's tsunami is over 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although World Vision staff in Dongala have come safely and safely to the city of Palu, where employees are sheltered under a few lounges installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even while the disaster assistance tools were being put in place by the aid groups, some people complained that it was not possible to move to Palu from cooperatives with extensive experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, only foreign staff funding, supplies and equipment can be used if the site concerned is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"As the Government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but it has not yet happened."
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the people who were still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the disappointing stories that wrote the natural catastrophes.
The Saturday was taken out to a little kid from an alcantarilla.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the debris for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, instructor of Indonesia's national parachute team, had formed two of the missing parachuters for the Asian Games, which ended earlier that same month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi included, were his students.
"For my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden," he commented.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours that followed the disclosure of the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate messages from WhatsApp to the Palu competitors, who participated in the festival that was held in the beach.
However, their messages showed only a mark of gray, not two in blue.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves carry 26 750 USD during a reload of an automatic cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, some thieves attracted a Brink employee who recharged an automatic cashier in Newport on the Levee, carrying 26 750 USD, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an automatic casserole located in the centre of the leisure and was prepared to recharge it with more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came running behind the Brink employee" and stole a money bag for recharge.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw a number of suspects going from place to place, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about his identity should contact the Newport Police in number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapero changes his name to Ye
Coach Kanye West will start calling Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person previously known as Kanye West."
It's been a long time since the 41-year-old West was named Ye, a name he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before your appearance on Saturday Night Live, where you are expected to present your new album, Yandhi.
It replaced the singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons", as the program creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," said West early this year while talking about the title of the album with the big boy radio speaker.
"It's you, it's us, it's us.
It turned out to be Kanye, which means 'the only', to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
It is one of the many famous rappers that has changed the name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
An old West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in upper case or lower case, with or without script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obador, elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "I would never use the army to oppress the people of Mexico".
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired against a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when the left student movements were closing in all Latin America.
Lopez Worker has committed himself to providing support to young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should duplicate the financing of I.A.
Now that China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, I. A.'s investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments then emerge from the announcements concerning I.A. of several parts of the U.S. Government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official strategy of I.A..
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become number 1 in innovation in I A. by 2030.
"Duplicate the I.A. research budget would be a good start, as all the other countries are going very far behind the United States. We have a look at the next progress in the field of I.A.", says Lee.
Double funding means double the possibility that the next major achievement in I.A. is achieved in the United States, as Lee stated in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by editor Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most important companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of I. A. that won the best U.S. player in Othello. Later, he was executive at Microsoft Research and CEO of Google's branch in China.
Lee recognized the previous technological competitions of the U.S. Government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, which would enable the next generation of visionaries to be identified.
In the U.S., researchers often have to make a lot of effort to obtain government subsidies, Lee commented.
"It's not China that's leading academic leaders; it's corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent people from universities to work at I. A.
Lee commented that changes in migration policy could also help the US to intensify its initiatives in I.A.
"I think doctors in I. A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China funds people from academic institutions as well as the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations finance US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee commented.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, aimed at attracting partners in the industrial and academic fields, and the White House announced the formation of a Selected Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in research by I. A.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that sought to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action in months.
Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
Macedonia's people decided in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", a gesture that would resolve a decade-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its accession candidate to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbour's name is a claim from its territory and has vetted its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalists argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, most in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign questioned whether the participation would reach the minimum 50 % required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The paper of the referendum raised the question: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The name change players, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerge from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union, because this means a safer life for all," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote in order to be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported at one in the afternoon.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% of the last elections to Parliament held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters deposited their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, the prime minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their vote at the Macedonia referendum on a change of name for the country that would open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and removed chairs from the campaign shops that were to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with a very high head, not by the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of European integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would provide the investment that Macedonia needs so much, with unemployment rates above 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after depositing his vote.
He said that a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research, it was ensured that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, which would mean less participation to the required.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV from Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said I would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, the participation should be 50 per cent more than one vote.
If it failed, it would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Aguero, from Manchester City, scribbles all over Brighton's defense to mark a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling reiterated Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory that Manchester City won on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Aguero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the minute 65.
The Argentine midpoint received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before he entered the open field.
Once there, it was surrounded by four green shirts.
He failed to defend himself before going beyond several more on the edge of Brighton's area.
He took a walk to the left, where he was Sterling.
The English front used its first touch in the area to return the balloon to Aguero, who hit it with the right foot to avoid the Mathew Ryan gate with a shot that reached the right side of the network.
"Aguero has some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola, City coach, to reporters.
"We're talking about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have a goal at the time."
However, it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the First League's contest.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
In that game, Aguero received the balloon very much within the territory of Brighton.
He made a nice balloon pass to the left for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him some touch before heading to Sterling's second floor.
Sky blues' predecessor threw the balloon into the net just before it got out of the limits.
The city faces the Hoffenheim in a group party of the League of Champions on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena of Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to grab the party at the Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the content by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer expects to walk the mountain on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, won the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the National League, they still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wild card post thanks to the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still pursue their first title of division.
"Although we don't play anything, we can at least walk the tire with the assurance that Denver's audience will be animated and that the other team will probably play the highest level I've ever faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opening for Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to let Scherzer go in that situation.
Scherzer, who would open the door to the 34th, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington's history is 18 victories and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 entries.
Trump a half in West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, when discussing the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November everything we've done is at stake.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the most important. I don't present myself, but it's a race, so I'm going from one place to another fighting for big candidates," he said.
And he went on, "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all necessary means, see the mixture, evil.
They don't care who does any harm or who has to pass over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it."
The Democrats, he said, are engaged in a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"We've seen it these last four days," he said, saying that the Democrats "were angry, were bad, horrible and false."
He referred to the Senate Judicial Commission appointing Senator Diane Feinstein, who received public abuses.
"Do you remember your answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I expect a response. Her body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is already covering a wide range of views.
It's intolerant to people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was just surprised.
After all, I am the last of a row of Members of Parliament of the Labour Party who are told that it is not welcome, and just because we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
It was in disagreement with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in the field of national security, on Europe.
As indicated in the announcement of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of the eight years I have been a member of the Parliament of the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the night meetings of the General Committee have been on Fridays.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and kind" policy is already more than forgotten, if it really applied at some time.
It is increasingly clear that discriminatory views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party's leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously thought that he shared a similar political vision began to expect radically change of opinion and to adopt positions with which he would never have agreed, whether on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a pattern of insults on social networks demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be in the Labor Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues facing a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day, but they never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with each motion "of censorship" or each change in the rules of selection, the party becomes more narrow.
In the last two years, I have received many advice that recommended keeping my head down and not making me hear so much that it would be "good".
But I didn't put myself in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labor Party 32 years ago as a secondary student, motivated by the neglect of thatcher's government that left my entire school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, whether as councillor or as government minister.
I have never hidden my political ideas, nor in the last elections.
It is impossible for someone in Nottingham East to know my political positions and the areas in which I did not agree with the current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday's motion is that I do not understand these desires to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is headed by a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the electors, whether from the Labor Party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting as I think it is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: An Invited Ayr ascends to the top
Two trials at the end of the game may have decided to a certain extent the final result, but Ayr certainly deserved the victory in this entertaining party of the Tennent's Premiership day.
Now they're heading the table and it's the only invitable team of the ten participating.
Finally, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to take better advantage of the opportunities, which gave victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be happy.
"We have been tested in all parties and we are still indicted, so I have to rejoice," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, commented: "The Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of opportunities better than we do."
Grant Anderson's trial in minute 14, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr in front; but a yellow card to the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors' loan to the party, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent and Jason Baggot got an unconverted trial.
Climo expanded the advantage of Ayr with a penalty. Before, right in the middle of time, he marked and turned a trial into solitary, which left the marker in 17-5 in favor of Ayr in the rest.
However, Melrose well started the second part and Patrick Anderson's test, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, to whom they had to get on the trolley, and, as the party resumed, the Ayr progressed with a trial by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, Captain of the Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of having a more man with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the premises were recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for plating to Climo without the balloon, from the line of penalty, MacPherson did a test when he was in the back of the mud that was moving forward.
Climo converted it, as he had been doing since the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the balloon sent by David Armstrong of a patata and sent to the wing of Gregor Henry to the bottom to do the fifth trial of the locals.
Still Game's protagonist wants to guide his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, seems determined to move to the restaurant sector after being revealed that he has been appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC program, who writes and co-sponsorizes with his many-year-old comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Aföringmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "floorish restaurant market" in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": a landless Bolivia has the hope that the court will resume its journey to the Pacific
Marines watch a ship's general headquarters in La Paz.
In the public buildings there are sea blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazons, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
It's a duty to recover it."
Throughout Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the lost coast before Chile in a bloody conflict with the resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the longing to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a resolution of the International Court of Justice for one October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the failure of the International Court of Justice on large screens distributed throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will pronounce itself in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who frees a controversial battle for the reelection next year, also has much to say about the resolution of Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's resolution only reaches six months after the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, it may have been delayed in the last four years.
"The problem of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
In addition, he suggested that the belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any good remaining Chilean will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to keep conversations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would use the maritime theme as a political crusade.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave behind the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless I can trust the US.
Ri Yong Ho, Nordic Foreign Minister, says his nation will never be the first to complete nuclear disarmament if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments come at the time when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, appears to be about to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear paralysed matters more than three months after this summit with North Korea leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration ending with the Korean War to submit to the north is a "quimera".
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement without first making any significant disarmament movement.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to celebrate another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers to be the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the mandate holders.
Paris' fashion shows reveal the last line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself completely from the sun, don't look any more.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of large-scale eccentric hats for their summer spring 2019 collection in the gateway, emphasizing the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have led their spectacular creations to the gateway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide-banded wing with feathers that involved the heads of the models.
Other large-sized supplements were sandals with jewelry, a witch hat and even a pine, but are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of masquerades, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had hairy lips and remembered Hannibal Lecter more than the high knife.
One creation remembered a complete, snorkeling, and included forks, while another looked like a depleted ice cream cone.
If you like the big-sized fashion, you're lucky.
The style hunters preach that huge hats could begin to be seen on the shopping streets.
The big hats come up with strong hands from "La Bomba", with a paddle hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The mark of worship behind this so little practical hat that flooded the social networks presented another great creation in the passageway: a beach bag as large as the model in the bath carrying it.
The dark orange reef bag, decorated with rifle arrows and a white leather bag, was the main piece of the collection La Riviera de Jacquemus for the spring-summer 2019 season in the Paris Fashion Week.
As the famous stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "In the next summer, I hope to see hats and huge beach bags on the commercial streets. Since the designer has had a great impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale supplements."
John Edward: Linguistic skills are fundamental to the world's citizens
The independent educational centres in Scotland have a career of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in the examinations that are reinforced by individual and collective success in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30 000 students throughout Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Independent Colleges Council (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent colleges are intended to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted study plan, modern languages remain a popular and desired assignment in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message reaches his head.
If you speak your language, it will reach your heart."
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely only on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's examinations, we can note that the languages are at the top of the classification tables, being the highest approved rates in the independent colleges.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest score.
The data collected from 74 SCIS centres showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students also achieved an A.
This shows that Scotland's independent colleges support foreign languages because they are considered to be a fundamental competence that both children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, it is considered that, as an assignment, languages are at the same level as CTIM assignments (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent colleges and everywhere.
A 2014 survey carried out by the UK Employment and Competence Commission revealed that 17% of the reasons for the difficulties faced by entrepreneurs were attributed to the lack of language skills.
Linguistic skills are therefore increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
Possible job opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the race that someone chooses, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last all your life.
The fact of being able to communicate directly with persons from foreign countries will allow that person to advance automatically to competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language as well as to keep a conversation. It was also established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for children today.
If you know a number of languages, especially those from developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each college will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach the most important languages for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Anyone who is interested in a child, in independent colleges, will always be able to choose from a number of languages provided by teaching staff specialized in this matter.
Independent education centres in Scotland devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and that teams with the necessary skills to succeed, whatever the future holds them.
At the moment, it is unmistakable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "competence for international communication".
Independent colleges will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to the young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent College Council
LeBron starts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans waiting to see LeBron James begin their first match with Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play the opening party of the pre-season that will be held Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, you still have to figure out how many minutes you're going to play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton commented on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, posted on a tweet that was probably James playing a few minutes.
After a training session at the beginning of this week, James was asked by his plans for the six Lakers pre-season program.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare me," he said.
Trump's Half-Time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign myths tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings for the next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the candidate's confirmation vote to cover the vacancy of the Supreme Court pending, Trump intends to obtain support for the next half-year elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump's half in West Virginia tonight and how can you see online?
Trump's meth in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see it online via a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on the appearances this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who have been charged with improper sexual conduct and have been waiting for an early vote to confirm the Senate for a week as much as the FBI investigates them.
However, the main objective of this series of myths is to help Republicans who face November's elections to gain momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign pointed out that the five minutes next week were intended to "encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they retain in the Senate and in the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign," Reuters said a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to give his name.
Programd at the Wesbanco Arena Stadium in Wheeling this evening could attract supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as to have coverage in the Pittsburgh media," West Virginia Metro News reported.
The Saturday will be the second time in a month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won for more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is being dismissed in the polls.
"To Morrisey it is not a good sign that the president must come to give him a push in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows that it dares to fight to keep the hope alive to the individual parties on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating impulse pendulum is a fully invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, even more in competitions like these.
So, where would they say the impulse is now?
"They took us six points of advantage and now they're taking us four, so I guess that can be considered a little impulse," Jordan Spieth commented when he finished the day.
Europe has advantages, of course: four points forward with twelve more in play.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel that they have some wind in favor and reasons to be animated, among other reasons by the couple formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three points of four each.
Speeth has been fatal from tea to green and preach with the example.
The Gutural Celebration screams rose by volume as their round progressed, introducing a vital putt to empatriate the fourth party when he and Thomas went down two behind two holes.
The putt that the party gave them in the 15th was received with a similar cry, of those who transmit that he believes the US team has not yet left.
"What needs to be done to redouble efforts and concentrate on the party," Spieth commented.
That's what these players have done.
18 days to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Speeth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable partner of Europe takes four out of four and nothing can hurt them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a crazy Saturday afternoon, but also the crazys avoided Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine days of Friday morning.
That rain and the way it flows its energy with the bulky public make it clear that these are the players that must win on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun is placed in Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different days.
Even so, it remains premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson fired Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four ball in the morning, after becoming a partner with Alex Noren.
One crazy and two doubles in the first nine holes buried in Spanish and Swedish in a hole they could not get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no kind of help to get out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see them close because they appreciate the interactions between couples, advice that they give and that they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in a moment.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a great advantage to the last day, but this forums meeting has also shown that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe progresses by 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe has a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and the foursomes with a result of 10-6 on the United States.
The motivated two composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two victories over a Tiger Woods that was seen in the auras, advancing four points in the Le Golf National classification.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning's fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the fursoms, winning two matches, but did not achieve short distances.
U.S. Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual parties on Sunday to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel to win four consecutive points. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the podium of "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points in their first four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, his magnificent union served to beat a disheartening Woods and American novel Bryson Decahmbeau for a round 5-4.
Woods, which in the two parties on Saturday had not been too prominent, had occasional moments of brightness, but now has lost 19 of its 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning's fourballs, again became Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three from the world respectively, with a result of 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in southwestern Paris, Europe did not have all of it.
The three winning times, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference to the Americans, getting two points on Saturday.
They won a passionate victory 2-1 in front of the Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the two initials.
In the history of Ryder Cup, that a team recovers from a difference of four points in individual games has only happened on two occasions, although Furyk, as the owner of the trophies, only needs an empathy to preserve it.
Although it has been the best seconds for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says that "there is no possibility" that they are first disarmed unilaterally if they do not trust
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his confidence in the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would renounce nuclear weapons unilaterally under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho declared to the annual General Assembly of the international body that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and undertaking non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we did not receive any similar response from the United States," he said.
"If we do not trust the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and, under these circumstances, there is no possibility that we will unarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korea complaints about Washington's resistance to a "by-step" denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, its statement is important, since it has not rejected any further unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active U.S. president and a Nordic leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim committed to working for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up his nuclear weapon first.
Washington has also resisted appeals to mitigate international sanctions to North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased the pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, including instigating objections to a declaration of end of war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a cinema of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri made no mention of the plans of a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the United Nations leader in the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae, South Korea leader, in the last five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the stake in denuclearization rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been in a similar stagnation."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to lead North Korean missiles to the US soil after the "bad president" Trump, in a suicide mission, called Kim "a man of rocket".
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in the advance towards disarmament, but said that much remained to be done and that it was necessary to continue to apply sanctions until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, no matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, like the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey, he informed the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously and unimplemented until we realize the final and fully verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for the ballistic and nuclear missile programmes of Pyongyang.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He was from Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea reported that his "needs were those of a mafia".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantle a missile location and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "relevant measures".
He said Kim had informed him that the "relevant measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
Thanks to a new course this year at Harvard University, all university students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing machist culture to study all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that university students number one in the world often have no idea about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, is believed to be the first of his class in the U.S.
His motivation to launch the course arose after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl approached and asked me why she had just learned about this now, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever talked to him about the importance of the dream, which surprised me," The Telegraph commented.
The course, conducted for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the health services of the university, noted that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students only slept during the week.
The course of one hour includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of the lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression and cancer.
Then, an icon of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students at the moment.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know the effects on tobacco smoking health," added Professor Czeisler.
He said that the culture of pride for "passing the night on a sail" still exists and added that modern technology and increasing pressure to which students are subjected meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough time and a good quality dream should be "the secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gain weight, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, which is why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year in Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to extend it to the entire campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler's recommendation is that students think about putting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emits the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter the circadian rhythms, so they would end up having problems to stay asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal is to kill the men of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression outside the home, when the attack by Dolly Menga destroyed Steven Gerrard's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
The Ibrox wanted to win their first victory out of the house since the 4-1th February triumph in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team at eight points in the Hearts, leading the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack occurred seven minutes before the middle of time and the uninvited alignment of the Rangers was at no time.
Now, the Rangers go down to the sixth position, Livingstone goes up to the third, behind the Hibernian for the difference of goals.
The Rangers may encounter more problems, as the Calum Spence line judge had to receive medical assistance for a head injury after someone allegedly launches an object from the visiting background.
Gerrard changed eight of the holders who won the match against Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scotland League Cup.
Holt, for his part, took out the 11 Livingstone players who launched a point to the Hearts last week and would have been happy to see how their organized team hid the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingstone made better use of the balloon when he had it.
They should have marked the two minutes of the beginning, when Menga took a walk into the space for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving it alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the mid-campus sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs took a deep loss for Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in the defense, Alan Lithgow, could only send it out of the long pole.
The Rangers recovered control, but it seemed there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been punished in the 15th minute of the party, when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but Albert Steven Thomson made a deaf ear to the Colombian petition.
The Rangers got two shots to port in the first half, but the old porter of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, only saw himself in trouble to deal with the head of Lassana Coulibally and the boring launch of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal marked in minute 34 by Livingstone came against all predictions, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers didn't have to deal with a deep play at Jacobs' stop ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the balloon for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed it to Menga to mark the goal.
In the rest, Gerrard replaced Coulibally by Ryan Kent, which had a almost immediate impact, as the wheel was passing it to Morelos, but impressive Kelly came out of his line to block it.
Even so, Livingstone continued to take visitors exactly to the kind of game she likes, with Lithgow and Halket clearing a long walk after another.
Holt's men could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a head corner that didn't come in.
The Rangers' substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty to the end of the party after a meeting with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked elsewhere.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page of the Almanac section of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and CONTANDO... was born in Germany the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as Geiger counter.
Count Geiger, who has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Crown Campaigns", with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of vaquer scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the earpieces, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and kill them.
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and changes them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a common protein to many cancers and renegotiate them.
A vaccine test is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "promots the growth of different types of cancer", such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teach them" to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West boarded in a diathrow in favor of Trump with a MAGA hat after its appearance in SNL.
It didn't work out well.
Kanye West was grounded in the study of Saturday Night Live after a wrongful performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would be presented to the elections in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he used his head with the message Make America Great Again, began to despot against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to someone white and wonder how I can like Trump if he's racist.
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have gone from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started Matt Damon's program with sketches in which Hollywood star complained about Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate's Judicial Committee regarding the charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not retransmitted, comedian Chris Rock went up the recording of West's bronze to social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the public that it had gone wrong among the builders to wear that hat.
"They went with me.
I was told not to go out with the head put on.
They're stuck with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see what sleep I am?" and added that he "was going to put on his superman's coat, because that meant that no one could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments received public abuses on at least two occasions and SNL members seemed embarrassed, as Variety reported. One person told the magazine: "The study remained completely silent."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-wife, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West unconcerned many when he went out to the stage to sing I Love it dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: Thank you FOR RESISTING TO MUCHEDUMBRE".
Karen Hunter, presenter of an interview program, tweeted that West was simply "being himself and that is absolutely wonderful".
"But I decided not to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes, or by supporting his art) who I think is abstinating and spreading a dangerous ideology to my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had changed, saying it was now "the person previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the missing legend of music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Attempt to kill by stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear on Monday in the Court of First Instance of Belfast.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, Tronos Game star, attack on toxic maleity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Nieve in the violent series of medieval fantasy of the HBO, game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of male hero, saying that these screen roles often passed on to young boys who had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married her partner in the Tronos game, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that she felt that it was "very important" to address this issue.
"Personally, it seems to me quite important at this moment, where have we made mistakes with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?"
Kit believes that television may have part of the responsibility for increasing male toxicity due to its male characters.
And he went on, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, which makes young people feel they have to be this particular form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any Tronos game precuela or sequela when the series ends next summer, claiming that he is "a harp of battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will play True West, Sam Shepard's theatrical work that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Shortly ago, the actor revealed that he believes that getting to know his wife Rose is the best thing she's got out of the Tronos game.
"I met my wife in the series, so, in that sense, she gave me my future family and my life from now on," she said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the loving interest of the character of Kit, Jon Nieve, in the fantastic award-winning series Emmy.
The couple got married in June 2018 at a family farm in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country, there are more than 820,000 affected persons, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which is a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was rapidly spread by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced in its total practice, the Chinese health authorities declared at a convention held in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGTB community.
Homosexuality was detonated in China in 1997, but the LGTB collective suffers from much discrimination.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are because they do not use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of his staff will filter data from senators of the Republican Party and ensure that it is "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
The representative, Maxine Waters, criticized on Saturday the allegations that a member of his staff had published the personal data of three US senators of the Republican Party on Wikipedia's legislation.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claimed that these accusations were driven by commentators and "extreme right" websites.
"Truths, lies, and more vile lies," Waters commented on a Twitter publication.
The information published allegedly included the addresses and phone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol published information on the Internet during a Senate panel meeting on the allegations of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The filtration took place sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
"This unsubstantiated charge is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal and security data have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was for nothing responsible for the filtration of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including those of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"Design this information with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that it is not the temple necessary to be a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
He shouldn't rebel.
He must not question the accused's motives.
It must keep calm and serenity."
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare the response of Waters to the criticisms of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, whom the dictators accused of looking too angry during the presence of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to dump Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned "the relevant authorities and entities responsible for the enforcement of the law of these fraudulent accusations".
"We will ensure that the authors are discovered," he continued, "and that they are legally held responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all my staff members."
Critic of Johnny English: Again in action. Rowan Atkinson's parody falls short
Now it has become a tradition to look for guides to Brexit in any new film with a British approach. It seems this is what it is to do with this new delivery of the parishioner's action and comedy Johnny English, who started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this self-satisfied ironic about the clearly shot that we are the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes jumping and his inexpressive face, has renewed his license to put the foot for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than nothing, it is a comical creation designed for non-English speaking film territories.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, in spite of his strange claims to defeat glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a piece of that guy who played a single note on the topic of Fire Cars that was played at the 2012 opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games.
In addition, it was based on the mysterious travel and international man represented by Atkinson years ago in the already forgotten Barclaycard television ads, which seemed to be the chaos behind him.
In this last delivery, there is one or two good times.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor while the helicopters were jumping against the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps into sight, but humor remains rather short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that "series" films such as 007 and Mission impossible add comic ingredients without problems.
Humour seems more directed to children than adults and, for me, the absurd disadvantages of Johnny English are not as clever and accurate as the silent jokes of Atkinson in Mr. Bean's role.
Now, the repeated argument of the present is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has been infiltrated into the super-secret network of British spies, revealing the identities of all his agents active before the consternation of the agent in service, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that grabs the vase for the first minister, a pumping and curly character who is seeing how his political popularity sinks: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room to work.
Your intelligence advisors tell you that, as all active spies are at risk, you will have to resort to someone who is withdrawn.
This has to be the Johnny English torpedoes, which now teaches in a worse college, although it gives extra-official classes about how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy academy similar to that of Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his former companion Bough, again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a nice paper for which Vicki Pepperdine is not used enough.
Thus, Batman and Robin, who do terrible things wrong in His Majesty's Secret Service, return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous traps of a multimillionaire charismatic technology world that claims he can solve the computer problems of Britain: sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odise of absurd situations: they dissipate from cameras, they fire an elegant French restaurant, they disavow the chaos hiding in the luxury yacht of Volta; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy when trying to use a helmet of virtual reality to familiarize itself with the inside of Volta's house.
Definitely, they were used in depth in this last sequence, but, because of the very graceful and strictness of it, the whole continues to convey a little childish feeling.
A pretty regular product.
Like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder if the British cinematographic industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that does true justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for British workers to work four days a week, but covers five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will think of a radical plan that British would work with four days a week, but would charge five.
It is assumed that the party wants the owners of the companies to target the savings obtained through the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea of "cashing" in the plans and the economic agenda of the party to incline the country to the workers.
This change to a week of four days has been supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to withdraw from the changing economy.
Like a high-ranking Labour Party report to The Sunday Times: A revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
"There will not be one day for another, but the four-day work week is definitely a matter that the party hopes to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy for the worker, as well as in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this kind of idea, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day work week in its 2017 general election campaign.
However, for the time being, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
A spokesman for the workers said, "The four-day work week is not part of party policy and will not be discussed at this time."
The minister of Hacienda in the shadow, John McDonnell, used the conference of the Labour Party that was held last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was willing to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "used" by companies providing public services.
The Minister's plans in the shadow also include the idea that the current shareholders of the water companies do not recover all their participation, as a laborist government could apply deductions corresponding to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers in corporate management councils and to create inclusive ownership funds in which 10% of private sector enterprises' shares are to be allocated to employees, which would represent annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 minutes" about FBI research around Kavanaugh and if I could make them change their mind.
The investigation by the FBI on the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has put the final vote for his confirmation as a judge of the Supreme Court and also raises the question of whether the outcome could affect any Republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be given on Sunday, the journalist of "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham are talking about whether the FBI could bring out information that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I was in favour of the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, and I said, "Have you done it?"
He showed himself firm, resolute, secretive."
Graham's vote, however, seems unmistakable.
"I already have a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and I'd get the charge up," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett secretly denied it," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she appoints has been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive sign of stars is gathered for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to the Great Lawn Central Park to enjoy events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be aware of the real objective of the event: to end extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free entry for the event (unless you can pay a VIP entry), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", as volunteers, send emails to a world leader, make a phone call or anything else that serves to realize their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has Global Citizen achieved in 12 years of achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to take measures or is it more than a form of so-called "clitivism", which is called the position that we adopt when we believe we are doing something really useful when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its partners in favour of a large number of different goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have achieved that world leaders will announce commitments and policies for a value of more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2250 million people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments are "The Power of Nutrition", an association of investors and executives based in the United Kingdom united with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop with all their potential". To this end, Rwanda has been proposed to provide $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens' collaborators.
"Thanks to the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and collaborators of Global Citizens like you, we can mark a small hit in the history of the social injustice of malnutrition," Tracey Ullman, ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions have been taken to try to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions raised on your website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
a Global Citizen collaborator replied: "It will be a long and hard path and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But as we have already achieved the human rights movements and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the events that we will discuss at the New York event this year, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Army to carry out the blockade on Russian energy exports - Secretariat of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington could use his Army to prevent Russian energy from disrupting the markets, including the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, as published in Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates in legitimate government instances, is no more than a pretext for expansion in new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the most supplier in southern Europe," he said.
Moreover, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
"The United States, with its Armed Forces, has the capacity to ensure that maritime routes remain open and, by the way, they could even block them to ensure that energy does not end in the market," he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are actually the same.
"The economic alternative in Iran and Russia basically consists of the use and replacement of fuels," he warned at the same time that Russia only knows what to do, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made when the Trump administration has been trying to stimulate the export of its natural gas to Europe and to highlight its role to Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unappropriate" project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, will become Berlin in the region of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which reaches a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project responds only to economic reasons and is a further demonstration of unfair competition.
"I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, after holding a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Energy Secretary, last September in Moscow.
The US position, however, has been found with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organization leading the industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the United States not to intervene in EU energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting recently held between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully analyse the possibility of presenting himself as a candidate for the presidency in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would study the possibility of joining the presidential race after the half-term election.
During a meeting in the town of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being raised.
"It's time for women to come to Washington to change our broken government and to finally have women among the leaders," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider presenting myself as a candidate for the presidency."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting in the Town Hall and stated that "he was taking the country along the wrong path".
"I'm really worried about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke without covering about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren said that "it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote".
On Thursday, a survey was published in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe that they should be presented for the 2020 elections.
A 58% of Massachusetts' "possible" voters claimed that the senator should not be present, according to the survey by the Suffolk Political University Research Center/Boston Globe.
However, 32% of respondents supported their candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy for 2020 of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, as reported by Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about track Palin post-traumatic stress disorder in a middle of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being incarcerated in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"The situation that is going through my son, for all that has happened since he came back, knows him very well the other families that suffer the effects of the TEPT and other wounded with which our soldiers return," said the public who gathered in a half in favour of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo of which no one wants to speak, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "lived with different, hardened behavior, wondering if there really is such respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country".
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, who interfered with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under drug or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of achieving a new asylum policy
18 states and the Columbia District support a judicial appeal to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence or gangsters.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district presented a "friendly" letter on Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum-seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant has not been revealed in the case "Grace v. Sessions" presented in August by the EU Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) against federal policy.
He said his partner "and his children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but US officials refused their asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of applications for asylum in the United States, such as nations facing generalized problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 decision taken by the Migration Appeals Board (BIA), for its English-language stamps, by which undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
Advocate General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, made a statement on Friday in which he stated that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law".
"In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications must be failed by the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, on the other hand, this exception violates that principle," is indicated in the curiae friend.
The lawyers also indicated in writing that the policy that refuses entry to immigrants harms the US economy by claiming that they usually become entrepreneurs more frequently and "substitute a necessary working hand".
The Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims who fled from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"People who leave their countries of origin may apply for asylum for persecution or threats of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or a particular political opinion," Sessions said when they announced this Directive on 11 June last.
The asylum has never been created as a measure to address all the problems, not even all the serious problems, which are facing daily people all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of deaths increases in a race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was increasingly harmful.
"The situation is very tense," Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us, while trying to comfort her baby with fever in a center of evacuation from the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute they get ambulances with more bodies.
And the water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search among the few nested property that remains in an effort to recover as much as possible.
There are hundreds of injured persons and hospitals, also damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are flooded.
Some of the wounded; among them, Dwi Haris, who had the back and a broken shoulder, rested on the outside of the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside the building because of the continuous replicas, also very strong.
I couldn't help but cry when he told us the violent earthquake that he lived while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the remains of the ruined wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of doing "bullying" with "propagandistic ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a US newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, President of the United States, Donald Trump, referred to China Daily's payment supplement in the Ten Moines Register, Iowa's most-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the elections at the United States Congress of 6 November, something that China denies roundly.
The accusation that Trump launched on Beijing's attempt to influence US elections marked what US officials indicated to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign launched by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels in imports by both sides.
The Chinese compensatory tariffs that applied to the beginning of the trade war were thought to bring back to state exporters such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Trump Party, as Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who is one of China's main exporters of agricultural products, said Beijing had damaged US workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
According to Branstad in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, China "is still intensifying that pressure with ads in our free press."
"In order to try to spread its propaganda, the government of China is benefiting from the precious American tradition of freedom of expression and free press in trying to publish a payment ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the kiosk of the street where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few dissuasive voices and no real reflection of the different opinions people in China may have on the worrying trajectory that is taking over the economy of their country, as the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most relevant journals eluded the offer of publishing" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts point out that Republicans are distanced from women before the mid-legislative vote with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many renowned Republicans are closing ranks in favour of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various charges of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a backlog, especially by women, can occur in the next half-legislatorial votes.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and many Republicans have expressed their desire to proceed with the vote.
"In this kind of matter it is not possible to go back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of Political Sciences at the Maxwell School of the University of Siracusa, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher argued that the last attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to take a stand for FBI research was enough to calm the disillusioned voters on this issue.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesman of the Progressist Group MoveOn, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators gathered at the Senate's doors said "November is coming!" (November will come soon!) at the time when the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats comes from all prognosis," said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, to the news site.
"People say that impact is already very relevant and, indeed, that is so.
But it could even be older, especially among the indecisive women of the outside neighborhoods and the younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who do not usually vote even though they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he had all the details of his charges of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that a retrocession could occur if the Republicans continued to confirm.
"This matter has become a big line for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former president of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only a question of the committee's vote nor the final vote, nor even if they sit in the bank in Kavanaugh; it is also about how the Republicans have handled all this and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, U.S. Director of Priorities (a group that helps in the election of Democrats).
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who they should believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, although they are a few more who are placed on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov indicates that 41% of respondents make Ford's testimony definitively or probablely, while 35% claim to believe definitively or probablely in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% claimed that he thought that Kavanaugh had probably lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least those of another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judicial Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her by drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the technology legend. A company based on Berners-Lee's solid open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
"It has to be now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology so that users can create their own "on-line personal data storage" or a POD.
You can include lists, lists of pending tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and at the same time.
Something that is exclusive in storing personal data online is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through the data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's general director, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach the whole world.
At the moment, the company is formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that bought IBM, some of the developers included in the template that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technological developers from around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not you're going to introduce a radical change where all your business models are completely modified from day to day.
"We're not going to ask permission."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "his mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website created in Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when it founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Despite being launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Clerk Who Winned a Victory Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during World War I has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellengliese and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later, and I never knew that he had been granted the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone and a show in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made it worthy of the decoration of his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "crossing a snowy thick and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, with the "greater courage", made the line move before he came to a cannon with one hand and dropped to three of the exhibition.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann killed him on October 4, 1918, only a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions he carried out his grandfather were "so great that I could never reach his height, but they were very exciting".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the show, which included the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was all a privilege for him to be part of the show" and added that "the value of an authentic hero is patented when he is shown such a large support".
The MMA followers were awake all night for Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stay awake all night to see the whole Bellator 206 so they won't let you see the main event at the end.
San José's cartel had 13 fights, six included in the main card, and in the United Kingdom it was going to be broadcast live at night in Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mouusasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face, the UK televisers remained silent when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay awake until the first hour of the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change in animated drawings as "a heavy joke".
"There is a government regulation that regulates the content that is issued from 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change the programming of children," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Marketing and Communication Vice-President of Bellator, when we asked him about the transmission.
"Pappa la cerdita," yes.
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they're going to modify the program to include British spectators in the next editions.
"When I think of the broadcast option, I think it can work," Coker said.
"But it's at 6:00 in the morning on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming changed, a lot of messages were received and not all were friendly, exactly.
We're trying to fix it, because at first we think it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are what we normally have done. We will try to offer more than usual so that the fans are happy and we pass.
It is a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to her sexuality
Olympic Jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a triumphist.
At his 24 years of age, he told us that he didn't realize until he came to the high school that "they weren't all like me."
In the first Desert Island Radio Discs 4 programme presented by Lauren Laverne, he said his intention in talking about gay rights was to convey "hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him take on the importance of winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months because of illness.
In Laverne's first program, Daley, which was shown to be a marginal, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "it was not socially acceptable that you would like children and girls".
He said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and strength to triumph."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he did not disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals in the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and its image has been used in the Commonwealth Games this year held in Australia to claim that more countries display homosexuality.
He said he told him because he was happy to live in freedom, without reprisals, and he wanted to convey that "hope" to others.
The three times the world champion declared that for him it was also all a surprise to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the winner of an Oscar last year, who is 20 years old, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so young" (it was his first 14-year-old Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who's been through the same high and low as you.
The couple had a son in June who they called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have turned around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, of course, Robbie."
His son is called his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was whether they had the steps to London 2012 because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I wasn't able to tell him I wasn't going to be in the first row," he said.
"He held his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and was not even at that exact moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that that was what I had dreamed of all my life: to compete in the pool in front of me in some Olympic Games, there was nothing better," he said.
This fact was also the one that inspired him to choose his first song, Proud de Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparation of the Olympic Games. He was still wearing his chicken skin.
Desert Island Disks is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low shape, stayed in the bank at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad hit.
Mickelson, who played at the event held every two years to get a record for the 12th time, was kicked off by Captain Furyk for the furballs and fursoms on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as many times it has done for the United States, the five-time champion of major tournaments had to conform with encouragement at some time and, in others, to try to perfect their game in the field and thus be able to correct what he is suffering.
Never the most direct driver, not even at the highest moment of his career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best form for the Le Golf National field, where the long rough is constantly punishing with wrong hits.
And if the field is no longer sufficiently discouraging, Mikkelson, on Sunday's ninth match, faces the brilliant British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined debut Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games that have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 individual parties, started out in an impressive way, Mikkelson's party could have been decisive.
Fury showed confidence in his companion, nor could he say much more.
"He perfectly understood the role he had today, gave me a palm in the back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"You have a lot of confidence in yourself.
It's in the Fame Hall and it's brought a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't think of him playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that's how it got out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest."
On Sunday, Mikkelson will overcome Nick Faldo's brand of more Ryder Cup games.
It could be the last of all a trail of Ryder Cups that had never equaled the levels of his individual brand so clearly.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 lost and 7 equal, although Fury said his presence brought much more intangible values to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to joke about others; it's great to have it on the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players have loved to have it as support this week, too; it was fun.
It brings much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the Captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you come with a substantial advantage in the last days of Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a band captained by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to finish with the others by climbing them to a minimum margin, winning 141 1⁄2-131⁄2.
"Don't stop remembering that we made a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and we lost, we did it in Valderrama and we won, but very little," said Bjorn, retired, after seeing the generation of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead it with a 10-6 in Le Golf National.
The story will teach us to me and to everyone that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all morning.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are in the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that's all we have to think about.
I say this all the time, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no less, than the best players in the world."
proud of what their players have done in a very hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to go ahead.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow is individual actions and this is different.
It's great to share what's going on with a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you'll test all your abilities as a golfer.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of one morning.
Now it's time to leave your partner one side, go and get the best out of yourself."
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as partners, being the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who sum up three points of four.
The same Furyk has been on both extremes in the last days of those great tournaments and has been part of the team he won in Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe carried out the "Milagro de Medina".
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When we all move in a direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
We assigned Thomas the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the main party, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole journey," Bjorn said about his individual selections.
The new German warship, once again
The new draft of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old ships of the age of the Cold War, but it will not be done until at least the year that comes due to defective systems and the progressive increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the boat leading the new Fragatas of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper a statement by a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery delayed the conclusion of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the Navy requested in 2007, will replace the old Bremen fleets.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-bullet missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as very low radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Among other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have caused innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power in the ultramarine) to be already old when they start providing service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate occupied owners last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship in operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media quoted a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if it was sent to a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half of the staff in the former Bremen class fractures.
It was also found that the ship has an overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the 7000-tonnes Rhineland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as other similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is believed that it has reached €31 billion ($36 billion), instead of the €2200 million initial.
The problems of new traps are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings on the reduction of the ship power of Germany.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Army is "remaining without ships capable of deploying".
The officer said the problem had been getting worse over time, because the old boats were given low, but they have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg fractures could have joined the Navy.
The National Trust spys the secret life of the Murcielagos
This new research, which has been carried out in a state of the Scottish Highlands, tries to find out how muscièlagos use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that everything that comes out will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help guide the next conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and soprano murals, as well as the river murals of Daubenton and long-eared browns of the Inverewe gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to track the activities of the bats during the season.
The NHS template and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
Experts will analyse the sounds collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of the calls of the musculoskeletals and what species they do.
A report and a habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, expects the results to reveal what habitat areas are more important to musculoskeletals and how they are used by each species.
This information will determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how forests for bats and other associated species should be maintained.
The populations of musciélagos in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been significantly reduced in the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical cables may also pose a risk to them, as well as insecticides and other chemical treatments of building materials or domestic cat attacks.
Murcièlagos aren't really blind,
but because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique that locates hormones and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the issue of murals very seriously.
He has ten experts trained in the field, who are dedicated to conducting regular surveys, nest inspections and, at times, rescues.
The organization has even opened the first and only reserve dedicated to Scotland's munitions in the state of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of mutilation in Scotland.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Treve, we have a fantastic area for muscièlagos," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the suitable habitat.
However, there are still many unknown things about the moustaches, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop."
It stresses the importance of checking whether there are muscielagos before carrying out maintenance tasks within the property, as an involuntary colony can be destroyed and 400 women and cattle could be killed, which would mean that all a local population could be destroyed.
Murcièlagos are protected and it is illegal to kill them, kill them, or torture them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust officer, has encouraged the public to cooperate.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species we don't know how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape at the same time as his lawyers prosecuted the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has cataloged allegations of rape as "fake news", and says that people "want to get to know" at the expense of their name.
Your lawyers have received instructions to denounce the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
In front of Portugal and Youth, he was accused of rapeing a American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was accused of paying $375 000 to cover up the incident, as Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With a video from Instagram Live that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, touched the report as "face news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false," says the five-time winner of the Golden Ball looking at the camera.
"They only want advertising at the expense of my name.
It's always the same story.
They want to be famous just to mention me, but that's right, I can't help it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a claim to Der Spiegel for the allegations that appear in what they have called "an unacceptable report of suspicion in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will try to obtain compensation for "moral damage for a quantity corresponding to the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years".
It appears that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her annually, according to the documents registered in the Clark County Court Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo was beaten after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a "99 percent" a "good boy" and that he had been defrauded by that "one percent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that she was allowed to.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she took photographs of the wounded in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she had "terror in reprisals" and was concerned "to be humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old woman claims that she is trying to cancel the agreement, since she is still traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join the Royal Madrid from Manchester United and this summer has changed to Juve, a big Italian football for a 100 million € contract.
Brexit: the United Kingdom would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would regret all its life" if it lost its position as world leader in the manufacture of cars after Brexit," said the Secretary of Industry, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK would communicate to the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without an agreement, production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby, would be temporarily stopped.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer claimed that the impact of delays in customs duties in the case of a Brexit without agreement could lead to loss of work.
The plant of Burnston, which manufactures Auris and Avensis models from Toyota, produced around 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain breaks up with the EU at the end of March, there will be production pairs in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have shown their fears about leaving the EU without an agreement, especially with regard to cross-border trade; including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are the problems that could arise in the assembly chains in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is based on the adjusted production mode (just in time) or at the last moment, where the pieces come every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to manufacture cargo cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, an interruption could occur at the border which, according to the sector, could result in delays and dissipation of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to accommodate the amount of material equivalent to more than one inventory day on its Derbyshire plant, the company said and, in that case, production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that theresa May's Chequers Plan, where future relations with the EU are established, is "accompanied precisely to avoid such controls at border crossings".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we need to take advantage of the opportunity," said the BBC Radio Today 4 program.
"The evidence of Toyota, among other things many manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what has, so far, been a set of extremely successful supply chains."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term, the added costs would reduce plant competitiveness and ultimately cost.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Trade Union on the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "After my experience, once these jobs are lost, they will never recover."
A government spokesman said, "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan that limits our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy General Rod Rosenstein could "stop for another week", as he continued the dispute about the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian elections, links between Trump and Russia's aid, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation before Trump decides to fire the general vice-fiscal or not and thus compromise Mueller's independence has fed Washington's chickens for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the conversations he had with Trump with a microphone that he himself had to try to relegate to the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, among the news that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (which was then in the United Nations in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said "I would prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified.
On Friday Trump asked the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would mean delaying the Senate's plenary vote.
The Trump Press Secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday in Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "No date has been defined, could be this week or could be postponed another, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We're going to decide on the move and I'm going to inform the press, as usual."
Some journalists would protest this claim: Sanders has not performed any press rounds in the White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the lack of press wheels was not due to an objection to TV journalists who acted with great pride, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they fanfarronize".
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds more sessions of questions and answers than any other president before him," he said, while quoting without evidence: "We have contrasted these numbers."
The press wheels will continue to be realized, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option to ask the President of the United States directly, I think it's much better than doing it to me.
We tried to do it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press wheel when you could talk to the president of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public or press meetings with the dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only happen on rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president showed why it was so, where he made a naked appearance and, at times, bizarrely, before the journalists who were gathered there.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers from NHS Scotland about their fears in Brexit
The Secretary of State of Health has written to the EU template that works in Scotland's HHS to express the country's gratitude and its desire to follow them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter only six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of applications for citizenship for EU members working in public services that are not dependent on central power.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit in which it was chosen to take the decisions expected this fall have followed.
However, the UK government has also intensified preparations for a possible stage in which there would be no agreement.
I know that all of this must be very disturbing to you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from all over the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefit the patients and the communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue telling you."
Christion Abercrombie is operating urgently after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a tennis player State Tigers, was surgically involved in an emergency after having suffered a head injury last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed informed reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"I came to the band and went off there," Reed said.
Both the trainers and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing it on a trolley and taking it to the bottom of it.
A member of the Tennessee State template told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in her first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five pickles on Saturday before leaving the camp, with which he took a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will be subject to a higher tax when they purchase a property in the United Kingdom
Foreigners will be subject to a higher tax on transfers of fines when they purchase a property in the United Kingdom and the extra money that is collected by this measure will be used to cover the "uncovered", according to the new plans of conservators
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the tax on the transfer of funds will be imposed on those persons who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million per year for the "uncovered"
The additional money that comes back with the increase in the transfer of funds to foreign property buyers in the United Kingdom will be intended for aid to the "uncovered", Theresa May announced today.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract the younger and more vulnerable voters.
The increase in money transmission tax will be recorded for people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and this money will be aimed at encouraging government policy to combat the problem of fraud in the streets.
The charge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the "buy-to-let" system, could reach up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, leading to an increase in prices and difficulties for people who buy for the first time to access affordable housing.
Many of the country's most populated areas (in particular, in capital) have become "phantom cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers that spend most of the time away from the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson claimed a reduction in transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the great builders of keeping very high prices in the properties when buying early land without intention of using it and urged Ms. May to eliminate the quotas applied to affordable housing to solve the "governing housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive housing reforms, including rental controls and the end of unwarranted evictions.
It also proposes to grant the local authorities more powers to build new housing.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, may not be able to buy housing more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become too difficult to reach for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to direct Scotland"
Sunderland's coach says his "primordial objective" is to become a coach in Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish has been fooled by the possibility of revitalizing the Northeast Club, which currently holds the third position in the League One (the third league division of England), at three points of the first.
He went to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Prime Minister's last season.
"Maybe to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B hat," Ross told Sportssound at BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was a child and it's something he's always done that he wants to come back.
This opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage a successful club."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's leader are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he passed to names so established in such a large club, after rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town proposals.
"At this moment, success for me is measured according to whether I can return this club to the Premier League,
because the structure and facilities of this club correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I've achieved my goal here when I can go back to the club where I have to be."
Ross only takes three years as a coach, after being an assistant in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the heart's technical body.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St. Mirren stop on the edge of the descent to win the championship in the next season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real cross," he recalled in reference to when the Alloa was charged.
"I always thought the direction was what was best for me, much more than playing.
It could sound weird, because it was good, I could win my life very well with it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face many things every week.
I still suffer the stress and pressure of this work; however, in the direction I feel well.
I always wanted to train, and now I have managed to do it, is the time of my adult life in which I felt better, no doubt."

According to a survey, the perfect time for a painting is 5.30 a.m. on Saturday
The heat wave of the summer has stimulated profits in British pubs struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on the restaurant chains.
The pubs and bars groups saw how their sales increased by 2.7 per cent in July, while the profits of the restaurants dropped by 4.8 per cent, as the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from the CGA Business Consultant, who was responsible for collecting the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the world have made it possible to maintain the pattern of the month before June, in which the pubs increased by 2.8% of their profits, although the restaurants have fallen even more.
The fall of 1.8% in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly had their most powerful month, in front of most restaurants, in which they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly food also suffered with heat, but not as drastic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In the managed bars and pubs, the sales of drinks rose to 6,6 per cent during the month, while the food dropped by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, of RSM's hosting and leisure analysts, said: "These results follow the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors in terms of sales in the business market outside the home.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year will prove particularly painful in view of the continued cost pressures.
The long and warm summer could not have come at the worst time for gastronomic operators and time will tell if the most moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand implants.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the United Kingdom's restaurants, bars and pubs, the performance data of 47 operating groups are collected and analysed, with a combined invoice of over £9000 million and is the market reference value.
One out of every five children have secret accounts on social networks behind their parents
One of every five children (some even 11 years of age) have secret accounts on social networks behind their parents and teachers, as a survey reveals.
The survey, conducted by 20,000 secondary students, revealed a growth in the fake Instagram pages
News has exacerbated the fears of sexual content
20 % of students claimed to have a "main account" showing their parents
One out of every five children (some even 11 years of age) create accounts on social networks that hide adults.
A survey conducted by 20,000 secondary students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a reference site to share photos.
The news has exacerbated the fears of sexual content.
About 20% of students said they had a healthy "principal" account showing their parents, while they had other private ones.
A mother who was found by chance with her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw how a teenager encouraged others to "violate me".
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of independent colleges found that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many adolescents are tempted to create Internet spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Federation of Athletics Directive
Elid Doyle has been elected to be part of the Scottish Federation of Athletics Directive as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most talented athlete on track and field in Scotland and his president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who claim to enjoy their great international experience in the past decade.
"Eilid is recognized and respected throughout the community of athleticism in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world, and we are sure that athleticism in Scotland will benefit greatly from it in its directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I like being the athlete's spokesman and I hope I can bring things and help develop the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta among the four gold he won and now is a usual expert at BBC, suffered a transitional ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine whether I would recover or to what extent I would.
It's been exhausting, but I got completely recovered, I had to learn to walk again, and I'm currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The ad of sacaleches where compared to mothers with cows divided into opinions on the Internet
A company of sacaleches has divided public opinion over the Internet with an advertisement that compares to mothers who breast-feed the cows they order.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the "first silent sacaleches of the world", the technology company for the consumer Elvie published an ad inspired in a video with some ironic music where it is shown to a few mothers who have the freedom that gives them the new milk extractor.
Four real women dance in a granary full of hay in dance mode, along with some cows, with letters like, "Yes, I order myself alone, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed it, they're not holes, they're my chests."
The choir continues to say, "I'm feeding your babies, order them, order them, order them, order my women."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a great controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it is possible to focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to place cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant before giving birth to be able to produce milk, except that they are taken away from their babies days after stopping them," one person wrote.
The milk extractor Elvie adapts discreetly in a breast-feeding container (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Trammatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to announce a milk extractor to mothers that they do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "Go on a more unraveled ad."
Other people, however, defended the ad, as a woman who admitted that the song turned out to be "desternative".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I still give up, I'm sure I'll have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a little rented, but I don't give it back.
It's a product genius," a woman told us.
Another person commented to us: "It's a funny announcement addressed to mothers who use a lactating pump (at times in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The ad is neither praised nor judged by the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the supporters.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who milk with the bomb say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes, and connects discreetly within the lactating holder, which makes its users able to move, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, mother's partner and ECD, says: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it was worth a daring and provocative launch.
By showing parallelism between expressive women and dairy cows, what we wanted was to draw attention to the use of lactating bombs and their challenges, while we demonstrated in an entertaining way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new bomb offers.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb appears in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children shot through the gateway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of minor immigrants discreetly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of juveniles detained has experienced a significant increase, although the monthly flow at the border has been almost maintained at the usual levels, partly because the rhetorical toughness and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicated in the possibility of abstinence to these children.
Traditionally, most of the patrons, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, were afraid that the fact of proposing to welcome a child would put their own stay in the country at risk.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential employers and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that data would be shared with government immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albenze, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Office, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to accompany unaccompanied minors.
The agency confirmed that after 70 per cent of the detainees had no criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of the sponsors or their families are illegally located in the country, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these people," Albenz said.
In their efforts to prosecute minors, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum period of one month from the detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the workers of reception centres.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, instead of in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who are not considered fit for shelter shall be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers of the reception centres and the reports of the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain under custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent arrests or attempts to flee.
According to defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo's, where it is more likely that, because of their size, the signs of abuse in these children are overlooked.
Moreover, moving to the camp without having given them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to get rid of their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria requests the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, also requested Syrian refugees to return to their homes, although the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and that the topic "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism has practically ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "fighting in this holy battle until we purge all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land soldiers in this country devastated by war.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem stated that the appropriate conditions were laid down for them to return and to blame "some Western countries" for "smear irrational fears" that the refugees would decide to stay outside the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last important Idlib rebel base has created an opportunity to strengthen political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by the Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had some "clear places" and has expressed the hope that military action will focus on the Yihadists, including the combatants of the Nusra Front (binding on Al-Qaeda), who will "be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a special envoy from the United Nations, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second warrant
According to that logic, Trump would win the reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators will probably expect, a resignation or scandal will soon end its presidency.
This would be without a doubt "The most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!"
There are currently no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the peak attendance rates have doubled to CNN 1.05 million and have almost tripled to MSNBC 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum audience hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC has exceeded cable channels indexes with 3.5 million viewers for the main night news programs.
"It is a strange attraction that we have not yet been able to understand," says Neal Baer, author of "Designed Survivor", a drama series by ABC on a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip he made in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver said he'd vote for Trump.
Why? He asked her.
"Because it makes me laugh," was the answer Scovell received.
Chaos is always up in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike anything else seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe Case against Wade, the possibility that immigrant families can meet or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can be allowed.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you realize that you have six hours of watching a panel of experts discussing the use of the sources of "deep cross-ground" used by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather hunter ($5,000) ("a piece of uncontrolled pride" in The Washington Post) and the implications of the scrupulous descriptions of Stormy Daniels of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario the same way.
"By offering something new every night, it's partly what makes everything look like a reality show," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", when he talks to us about the alternate show of Trump and his daily drama rounds (either getting into a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to lose an episode if you don't want to stay behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny day of 27 degrees on the north coast of Kauai, but he was safe inside the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not turn off the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Commission and with the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a thread.
"I remember when in those days we did all those crazy programs and people told us that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss says.
"I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right."

Foreign money flows in the most adjusted half-term election of the House of Representatives
It is not a surprise that the flow of money is reaching the 17th Pennsylvania district, thanks to the restructuring of a Congress district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same stage.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, whose structure is recently redesigned, has the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that is largely covered by the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The career for the new 17 has triggered a funding contest for the campaigns between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (NCCC) and the National Campaign Committee (NCCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Pennsylvania Congress District.
That step had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support to China, although after it failed back
Diplomatics observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a pleasant meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners left for the Trump Management Team.
Officials of the Department of State decided to return to the heads of the US diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the " recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to punish El Salvador, which had already received some 140 million US dollars in 2017 for, among other things, control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As the internal meetings progressed, US and Central American officials held a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that their intention was to continue the conference, which would put an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence intends to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, if diplomatic, is a sign of the importance that the administration has given to the meeting.
The three US envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic in peace without further threats or punishment from Washington.
One spokesperson for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to address the internal deliberations under the terms of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst near the administration, who also spoke under anonymity.
The Study of History
The next planned step could be the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump's justice, which already has considerable evidence in the public register.
It is thought that Mueller is also taking this to investigate the possibility that Trump's campaign would work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be accountable to that chamber, just when he is prepared to appear again before the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his parents.
This is a lot of conditional, and I therefore do not suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of its equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the content.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to give a coup against Hitler. There was only a need for the West to resist and support the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or delays.
The Americans are now facing several of these inflection points.
What would we do if Trump fired General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's research?
Rosenstein has been seen in a good one since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested to record the president in secret and speculated about his incapacity for office.
Rosenstein says the explanation for The Times is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or just, or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all of this, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will report to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will meet with a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I don't think we're going to fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador's house.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to burn the candles of the Sabbath on the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that legacy, how am I not going to be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans de los Rangers, optimistic in front of the Rapid Vienna meeting
The Rangers will play on Thursday at home against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive empathy in Spain against the Villareal in early months, will place them in a strong position to be classified in the G Group of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented Mid-Campist Graham Dorrans from reaching its first appearance from the season until the empate of 2 to 2 against the Villareal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a trampoline for larger things.
"We got a good score, because Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We started the party believing that we could get something and go out with a point.
We might have achieved victory at the end, but in general, the empathy may have been a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the rest we went out for everyone and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope that we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult party because they already got a good result in the previous party, but with all the public backing us, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now a general environment is noticed that everything will be fine.
The team is fine, the boys are enjoying a lot and we're having a good training.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the past season and achieve success."
Fear of retirement savings is making some women lose sleep
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it to their relatives.
Around half of the people who participated in the Nationalwide study said that they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family, but they are not taking steps to have this conversation," says Holly Snyder, vice-president of the National Life Insurance Company.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes with sufficient anticipation.
Work with your consultant and your family to talk about where and how to get attention, as these options can be a determinant of the cost.
Includes in the conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Its long-term funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help you cover your expenses or to secure yourself with your own savings, provided that you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: advance to legal battles.
It is responsible for obtaining a medical care power to appoint a trusted person to supervise his medical care and to ensure that professionals comply with their own wishes if they cannot communicate.
You can also prepare a notarial power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on his behalf and make sure that his invoices are paid if they are incapacitated.
Do not forget the details: imagine that your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer the questions about medicines and allergies?
Write all these details in a written plan for you to always be ready.
"It's not just the finances that are at stake: what doctors should treat?" asked Martin.
"What medications are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
You have to have everything planned."
Several times they shoot a man with a carabine in Ilfracombe
They shot a man with a carbine several times as he walked home after going out at night.
The victim, a man about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he received gunshots in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (British time), as a "sad act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
Her injuries are not fatal and the police have called for possible witnesses.
Terretos y tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, the authorities said. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
With blocked communications, assistance officers have not been able to obtain any information from the Dongala Regent, an area in the north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a regent extending over more than 300 km (180 miles) of coast on the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The review, which is an administrative region which was probably less than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowoli, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Dongala in 1996, with nine fatal victims.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Centre, a region of great seismic activity, and often suffers from earthquakes.
The following are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia, in the north of Sumatra, caused on 26 December a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the West coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
There were hundreds of deaths on the island of Nias, facing the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6,8 earthquake hit south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with almost 700 fatal victims.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of people and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low earthquake hit Pidi Jaya's regent in Aceh, causing destruction and panic in recalling the devastating deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time it did not provoke any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large-scale earthquakes that resulted in the death of more than 500 people, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested by charges of aggression.
Palin, aged 29 and a citizen of Wasilla (Alaska), was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report published by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to that police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he removed the phone.
Palin has been sentenced to pre-trial detention in Mat-Su Pretral Facility and is held with an unsecured loan of $500, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, the court was brought before the court, where it was declared "finally innocent" when its statement was requested, the chain was informed.
Palin faces three minor offences of Class A, which means he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor offence of Class B, with one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin are presented.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of interference with the complaint of domestic violence and of the possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had said he gave her a punch on his face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her child's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after a earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The earthquake of an magnitude of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, located in the north-east of Yakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that circulate on social networks and show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle car last October on the West Side highway of Bajo Manhattan, hitting the pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify a death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intendedly” and caused “intendedly” serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of the intention to apply for a death penalty, presented in the South District of New York.
The two charges entail a possible death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury presented Saipov with a charge of 22 charges including eight counts of murder with organised crime, which are often used by federal prosecutors in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", according to the prosecutors, who described the way in which Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and devious".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", specified in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York has been processing a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a New York federal case was in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were sentenced by conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed his lack of remorse during the days and months after the attack, according to legal documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be set aside in his hospital room, the police said.
The 22 charges have been declared innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represent Saipov, said they are "evidently disappointed" with the tax decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a declaration of guilt with eternal sentence of chains without the possibility of liberation will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had previously requested prosecutors who did not ask for the death penalty.
MEP Tory says NIGEL FARAGE should handle the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said the politicians had to " feel the heat" of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham's concentration that the United Kingdom "would have gone out" if Farage had been the secretary of the Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Prime Minister May in reconciling his divided lines has been further highlighted when a group of Tories for the sake of permanentity have joined a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain the commitment plan that was signed in Cheques in the midst of the attacks of the supporters of Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that they continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the "cases".
Mr Bone said in the Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have already left," he said.
This Member of Parliament by Wellingborough added: "I'm going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to serve them.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and that we want to remain in the European Union is completely false."
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in the concentration, where he told reporters: "I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public in general does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote in favour and is not popular between our party and our activists, who are actually going out to the streets and voting in the first place.
Forget Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: The prime ministers keep their positions when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the concentrates that they would have to "sigh heat" to the politicians if they saw that they were going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them that we're not gonna let them go out with theirs."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We are going to mobilize the popular army of this country that has given us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the supporters of the residence traveled the streets of Birmingham before half an hour in the center of the city.
Some activists were wearing Tories Against Brexit's banners after the group's presentation this weekend.
The laborer Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's implementation during the opening of the conference.
"These are the same people who tell us that they can implement computer systems and all technology for Canada Plus, for borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers all the possibilities of presenting himself to the Presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that he will "consider all the possibilities of presenting himself to the presidency" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic of Massachusetts spoke about its future during a municipal meeting held on Saturday in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a usual critic of President Donald Trump, will be presented to the reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican State Representative, who was co-chaired by the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
Much has been speculated about the possibility that Warren is facing Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with the electors using the municipal format since Trump assumed the position.
An assistant asked him if he was going to be present for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to go to Washington to settle our irregular government, and that includes having a woman on top."
Arrested by the murder of LSU Sims player firearms
Baton Rouge (Luisiana) police announced this Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for shooting off Wayde Sims, LSU's basketball player, last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the 20-year-old arrest of Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a man who is seen in the video.
Yes, 20 years old, he was shot near the Southern University campus at the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in his head that finally caused his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, for 247 sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and received a shot from Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to having been at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and arrested in the police department of East Baton Rouge Parish.
Yes, a player from Baton Rouge of 1.98 meters high played in 32 games last season, being titled in 10 of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 turns per party.
Russian Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's orders give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since the time that Valteri Bottas was classified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was evident that the orders of the Mercedes team would have an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw down Hamilton in the oblivion when defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to get into boxes and let Hamilton run in the group queue, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went out a long time later and was put behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after an action with the almost glued wheels that made Ferrari's pilot have to get rid of the free interior at risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself on the third curve.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old that day, began from the last row of the parcel and was placed in the seventh place at the end of the first round.
Then he led a large part of the race while sticking to his tires to achieve a quick finish and to overcome Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
Finally, he entered boxes in round 44, but could not increase his pace in the eight remaining turns when he recovered Raikkonen fourth position.
It's been a hard day because Valteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real knight to let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect couple," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein in a half a Saturday for his insistence that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the appointment for the Supreme Court.
Speaking in a half-way in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are "bad, disgusting and false".
"The only thing that could happen and the good that is happening these last days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false," he said.
"When you read the publications and the filterings, and then they say, "But if I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't filtered it," he added while he was imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh on behalf of Ford in July and was filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the wine filtering of his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep him confidential and, therefore, I did."
But his negative didn't seem to sit well with the president, who during the middle of the Saturday night commented: "I'll tell you something: that was a really bad body language."
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing with his defence to the appointment of the Supreme Court, which had been accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and repugnance, they don't care who does harm, they have to turn down those who have to get power and control," said the president, Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the victory on Friday at Elite League before the Belfast Giants by winning the game back on Saturday for 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial advantage of two goals thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local empath before Dwyer restored the Giant leadership.
Francois Bouchard equaled the Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen assured his victory.
This was the third defeat of the season at the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who had just won the Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three parties.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to Kendall McFaul's assistance, while David Rutherford provided assistance so that Beauvillier would double the advantage four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very animated initial period, Sullivan returned to the local team with a desire to play at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to equal the game at 15:16 p.m.
Dwyer was assured that the Giants would take advantage before the first break when he noticed his second goal of the night at the end of the first part.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again leveled the game with a gorge in the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran were combined to help Nielsen to give Dundee the leader for the first time in the party at the end of the second part and secured the victory with the fifth goal of his team at the end.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home before Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the plane of the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died making sure that a plane that transported hundreds of people could safely disembark.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a large-scale earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The strong replicas continue to accentuate the area and many are trapped among the debris in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his seat at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport control tower. That tower was being hit by a strong balance.
It remained firm to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the track at that time, could be safely fired.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian ABC News channel.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts break when we hear this," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths may reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency states that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the ruins and many people could not be contacted," says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Some waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a massive burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being carried on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute there comes an ambulance with more bodies.
The water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to the CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is trying to help survivors wherever possible, but we do not know what they will find there
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are they ready?", CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit in the beginning of this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Aerial accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man has disappeared after the aerial accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a plane that exploded in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and the crew had evacuated healthy and saved the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that since Saturday afternoon a male passenger could not be told.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers continued on Saturday at the hospital and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events still remain unclear.
The airline and the United States Army said the plane landed in the lagoon before the track.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane got very low.
"That's something extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to advance by a water that reached their waist down to the emergency exits of the plane that began to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Army said that mariners who performed about a mill improvement work also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to the ground before the plane sinks about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
Aviation security network data indicate that 111 people have been killed in accidents by air companies registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor concluded his arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury the way he used mobile phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old accused, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, thus contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the street on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was on Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lieving, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they were only known a week earlier.
Rowlett said that at some point after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defence has scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would be in the hands of the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A third hip hop wants to fill your music with positive messages to reduce the negative image of the gender.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says that the hip hop has gone away from its origins of political messages and dealing with social issues.
They want to return to their roots and make the hip hop conscious to be popular again.
Interpreters such as The Fugees and Commons have seen a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York girl asks a couple to fire her after a "racist" text
A newborn from New York will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a mother's text message incorrectly complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the demand with a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed his condolences to discover that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER PERSONN," wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending him to his husband, he was sent to Maurice twice.
After realizing his stepdad, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Maurice, claiming that his previous daughter, who was African-American, had done a terrible job and was expecting a Filipino, as stated in the New York Post.
Maurice received the payment for one day's work and was sent home to Uber.
Maurice is now calling on the couple for compensation for the dismissal with a view to receiving a compensation of $350 per day for the position of six months of internal work for which she had been hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show you that things don't do that," he told The Post on Friday and added that "I know this is a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the claims that they were racists saying that the end of Maurice's employment was as reasonable as they feared they could not trust her after she had offended her.
"My wife had sent you something that I didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was wrong?
Your new birth?
Come on!
Comparing the demand as a "extortion," Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going for someone like that?
That's not that it's a very decent thing," the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still under way, the public opinion court has been given the opportunity to denounce the couple on social networks, criticizing them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington editors were afraid that readers would not identify with a talking bear, revealing a new card
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was hard to put in the place of someone who read it for the first time before their publication.
It is a great pleasure to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington."
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before being inspired into a playhouse to write the book for children, trusted that his work would be rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of books was something "agridulce" after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to assume," he said.
"But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieved something important: you're proud of him, even though it's not really worthy of you.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and had to fire me on the phone
On landing, his daughter was urgently transferred to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"No one regularly called to say that the situation was really bad, that was not expected to do so," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I received Nad's call to tell me that I was going to die in the next two minutes and had to quit her.
And that's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were slowly exhausted and left her system.
She had died before time and everything was turning out.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't study, I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stay firm."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now suffering the loss of her daughter, sailed on the plane along with the other passengers, except for the terrible experience she was experiencing.
"No one knew," he said.
"I got my head and tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane where I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from leaving their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers to which people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Ms. Davis, was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want no father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile lit anywhere."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found him after he had taken his life.
Ms. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that I can have an impact."
Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people you can come to and who you can talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don't feel silent, you have to talk about it."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband, who was 15 years old, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or anything," he says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we notice his change of attitude.
The Christmas day came to its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to overcome it: "Leave a void throughout the family.
He's left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is a cycle when the FBI starts research
"I thought that if we could really get something like what I was asking (a limited research in time, limited scope), maybe we could bring some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "going to the point" in the midst of a party paralysis.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI's investigation to be carried out?
Its negativeness is entirely due to chronology.
There are only five weeks left for the mid-term elections on 6 November. If, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to achieve the choice of the man they want for the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the knot and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korean deserters' "caen" figures with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong- one came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, said that last year there were 1,127 deserts, compared to 2,706 of 2011.
Park said that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high rates charged by human traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments on this matter.
The vast majority of North deserters are finally offered by South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says they have illegally crossed the border of more than 30,000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) strongly protected between the two Koreans.
China believes that deserters are illegal immigrants rather than refugees and are often repatriated.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations.
This occurred after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who agreed in general to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without the confidence of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances we will in no way be the first to disarm unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and says it is not suitable to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority of the House of Representatives, said that the appointment to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a "historic" and that it was not suitable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival of Austin (Texas).
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she was a hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh gave on Thursday before the Senate Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh was moved to deny the allegations that she had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was shown to be very excited, at times almost screaming and aggravating as he spoke about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling charges against them "gross and clearly coordinated defamations" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he showed his partiality against the Democrats.
"I believe that it is downgrading itself with those statements with and the way he has persecuted Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi raised his objections when asked if he would challenge Kavanaugh in the event that he was confirmed in office and that the Democrats would obtain the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say one thing: if you're not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, it won't be only fit to be in the Supreme Court, nor will it even be them to be in the court where it is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. District Appeals Court.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about the possible judgments of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Health Care Act or the Roe Case against Wade, since it is considered to be a conservative judge.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and wait for us to seem to be all right," Pelosi said.
And women have to push it.
It's a justified diatraphy, it's months and years of rage going on, and she can't release it without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so weird, do I?"
He continued, "It helped me a woman who was executive in a company and who told me that she also wept when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique for which when she was angry and started to cry, she told the person she was talking to: "You think I'm sad because I'm crying.
Well, no, I'm angry."
And then I continued with what I was doing.
I thought it was great."
The tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a man-dominated office, was once I found myself crying with an unexpressable anger. A older woman, a serious manager of whom had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the cockpit and dragged me to a ladder.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he said.
"They have no idea you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they've framed you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was picked up on an extra-trimmonial adventure on board a boat called Monkey Business, which had to withdraw from the presidential career, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, it occurred to him that there was no reason not to explore the idea that she herself would be present for the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-predicted decision," he told me among the songs 30 years later.
"Now there were seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone referred to us as Blancanieves and the seven Enanites."
As the campaign was already very advanced, it remained behind in the fundraising process, so it was promised that it would not go back to the race unless it would raise two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When he delivered his speech to announce that he would not have a formal campaign, he was so overcome by emotions (thanks to the people who supported him, frustration by a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on the capture of voters instead of delegates, and angered against sexism), he was attracted.
"The logic would have been to think that he had had a nervous crisis," said Schroeder recalling the press's reaction.
"You might have thought that Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are you going to put on my blade?
"Loró"?"
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit from Beijing
The first rescues of the trade war between the United States and China were overwhelming, and although much remains to be done to end the battle, a break between countries could benefit Beijing, experts believe.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning early in the year by placing oranges on the main Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $20 billion (15 billion pounds) in products, with taxes on half of the products entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent reparations, recently applying tariffs from five to ten per cent to US products worth $60,000 million.
China has committed itself to equalizing US attacks, and it is unlikely that the world's second most powerful economy will soon come to an end.
To achieve that backdrop Washington would mean surrendering to the demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the US trade war could help China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make it possible to start a drop in the economy in either of the two countries is in fact much more dangerous than what viewers have recognised so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focused on Asia's themes for the strategic cabinet Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and requests help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been more than seven years.
In a speech prior to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the country ' s conditions were improving.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normality.
All conditions for voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their means of life are now being met.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are six million people still living in the country and in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that promoted insurgency.
Europe is dealing with the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States has now led six consecutive European ground defeats since it last won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn achieved the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight during most of the tournament, threw his point of exit to the water in the 16 par 3 hole, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari highlighted in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players that have never achieved a 5-0-0 since it started the current format of the tournament in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 in front of the player with the lowest classification of the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The number one player in the world, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 in front of the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became European with more tournament victories at all times, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very hard year.
I'm totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have been able to get the cup back.
It is a achievement of the whole team and I am very glad I could have helped," said a excited Garcia after the victory of the European team.
Now the antorcha passes to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated the legend of the American golfer Tiger Woods for 2 and 1 in an individual match.
"I'm an incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, as I grew up seeing this man," said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost the four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, which has won 14 great titles, leaving only behind Jack Nicklus.
The U.S. team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Fury said after the disappointing performance of his team: "I am very proud of these guys, they have never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we lost him.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Your 12 players have performed a very good game.
We will regroup, meet with the American PGA and with our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will proceed.
I love these 12 boys a lot and I'm proud to be your captain.
Now it's our turn to lean our head.
We have been overcome."
