Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth American President of history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded to him, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife, Michelle, will land in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a program.
It will first go to the Nobel Institute, where it will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who elected it in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's planning is then scheduled for an interview with the king of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet its summit in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the prize in the Committee itself.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the price.
The President does not want to avoid this subject because he is aware that he is receiving this prize by being a president who carries out a war in two countries at present.
He strengthened the war effort a few more days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics would forget to stress.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million Euros).
He is counting on doing charity work, but he has not yet decided which.
His program will then lead him and his wife to a banquet that includes, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of the government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reticent at this price at the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, the feeling of not fully deserving of it.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
After the announcement, he stated that it would be an "invitation to act".
A defender of the accused nature of blackmail
The Lithuanian Police accused the president of blackmailing the Association Society of the Protectors of the Nature of Lithuania.
On several occasions last year, he appealed for several construction works procedures and asked for the money from investors for their personal benefit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, a spokesperson for the Lithuanian police.
The President of the Society of Protectors of the Nature of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in prison and at risk for up to three years.
Three of the wastes are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can choose their drinks packs, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on trinnes at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take a few minutes before you can find the right goods.
I don't mean that we wouldn't be picking up all the waste in Brno.
But I feel that the municipal councillors in our city, the second largest city in the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is at the age of three of the wastes not only because citizens can still only choose paper, glass and PVC, but especially because of the number of goods devoted to these wastes.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city center?
It's all science, which especially requires time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found for the moment is Moravia's place in front of Potrefena Husa.
Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't like me, but I don't think so.
Without talking about the fact that in other neighborhoods of the city it's not a safe one anymore.
So to end, many of my friends don't choose their waste.
By blindfold.
It's a trick for them to get to the goods.
I'm not surprised about them.
After a party, I proposed to go throw some bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any Kounicova street color bands.
Luckily, I found the right place by going to the tram.
That's what the waste was about.
It's after the whole centre of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, right?!
It is likely that ecology and alleged aestheticism are not too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city throughout the country, instead of buying some additional goods and offering the three more raw materials for a more clean Brno.
I am happy to have been able to comfort my impression with official statistics after taking a moment online.
According to ECO-KOM, Brno is indeed the worst in the whole Moravian region of the South.
Paroubek's budget is outside of retirement and sick leave
After the left has increased, in spite of the Government's opinion, farmers or employees may lack money for retirement, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for the interests of the State's debt or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social-democratic and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make loans for sensitive spending, retirement or sick leave. "It's just to solve the problems later, to mine the land," Janota said.
It must be known that the interest to be paid is increasing and that it will have to be repaid sooner or later.
The state does not really have the choice to know where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social aid or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
All those currently left increased: firefighters, educators, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their retirement or sickness insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of the state's greater debt - next year it will not miss 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, debt will grow more rapidly and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The State will need money to feed it and it will not be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
It will also lack five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to some groups of voters.
This is mainly a decision-making and start-ups which cannot be modified to reduce costs, if any.
The most important thing is to keep them, which is not free anymore.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major construction sites, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to the care of Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to resolve the financial deficit very quickly - it will be able in the ČEZ dividends (electric power supplier and distributor), that the State has largely and will feed the transport funds.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case a well without funds.
Last year, it was 18 billion who were navigated from the CEZ to the budget.
Every year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement the retirement accounts, or to serve as a reserve for the reform of the pensions that are being prepared.
This also increases the actual budget deficit of 5.7 per cent of GDP in accordance with EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various damages to the victims of communism and crime, even the housing savings, has decreased by nearly three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we forgive an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save the department's side or, in the worst case, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a lack of one hundred million in the draft State Fund of a value of two billion, which should allow for an online monitoring of the expenditures of each administration.
The first step will begin in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find any money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would have taken place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been discovered seem promising.
It's enough of a button and you move from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the objective of the American company VMware, which primarily deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can change between them, you can distinguish them in personal and professional
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company indicated in an interview for the computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and it was first shown a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is nothing compared to fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, with a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a Nokia N800 modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, which was simultaneously running the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is currently working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to current devices in 2012.
The snow shortage in the mountain disturbs the hotelers
The desert trails only pose problems for the lift-lift operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to destroy free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have many visits to our website.
Internet users travel offers, demand prices, but do not hesitate to book for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud in Christmas," said Martin Jandura, exploiting the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year's dream in Špindlerův Mlýn, it's better not to hesitate to book.
If economics are given priority and the quality of the accommodation comes only immediately, then we can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler's hotels offer only one week's stay for New Year's Eve.
I think they're going to try again for a while, but they're going to be able to do it, too, and they're going to take shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will decrease quickly," Jandura estimated.
The Ingtours of Vrchlabí tourism agency also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The Christmas week interests us the most for the moment, it is not completely sold.
It still remains free, let's say, half the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared some less expensive Christmas stays," Ingtours Petr Schiefert said.
The Vrchlabí Tourism Agency can also offer New Year in Krkonoshe, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February go as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoshe.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the snowless mountain.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," thinks Schiefert.
On the other hand, the hotel's occupation of Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of almost five percent.
We have a few last seats for New Year as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the holidays of January of the Polish and February is also well sold," reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The hotel Omnia near the central parking area of Jánské Lázně is also full of four-and-twenty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty in Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent of employment at the present time.
February is a little lower for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkonose will grow again certainly indicated the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hotels of the Krkonoshe, however, should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be fresher and if there are precipices, they should be snowed in the mountains.
But then the time should warm up, reports Jiří Jakobský from the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repeating is a mother of wisdom
It becomes even funny, the austerity effort Barack Obama, president of the reputation of wisdom, reflects his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan issue, which he considered himself to be quite simple.
When he ended up letting his doctrine so heavily awaited, he found that he had copied it to the carbon paper since the Iraqi Bush scenario three years ago.
Not happy to use in the text even several times the expression "like in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is more, to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A new road ahead"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements into a Iraq consumed by civil war as "an irresponsible and catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which contained recommendations from campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely success at this point that newspapers at present do not speak of Iraq as a whole.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, as he said, objectively speaking, he left his successor a much more favourable final situation than we could hope for.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen
These are once again campaign commanders who have asked for an increase in the military contingent, including the Afghan Operation Commander, General Stanley McCristal, who has even severely criticised the reticence of the White House despite the habit of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The President hesitated for three months but, in the absence of a better option, at least the general of 10,000 soldiers was knocked down.
He managed to remove the promise of 5 000 additional on the part of Europe, even though it was at the beginning of 10,000.
What causes the most problems in Obama's entire strategy seems to be her intention to remove the armed forces from Afghanistan by 18 months and to complete this process by three years. Obama's entire doctrine raises more questions than she provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase in half will bring the same fruits as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratrician wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders respect the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the exact opposite - one cannot rely on anyone and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, used to change the leadership of day-to-day as planned.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will only remain the dust behind which will spread patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity regarding the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "promoting state" which is the basic purpose of the operation does not seem to be very real.
The timely horizon of Obama's strategy makes it perplexing by its volunteerism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only made it rain and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "soon return to the house" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it to be the indirect asset of the American defeat.
NATO's latest summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is directed towards the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not have an impact on Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of a solution to the problem of military use.
For example, it will have to be answered when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will lead to a dramatic return to the Afghan situation.
The only rusty for Obama is that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore it remains long enough for it to plan on a new strategy, if it would prove to be a total fiasco.
The leaders of the Goldman Sachs bank will receive no more cash prizes
Senior U.S. Goldman Sachs employees will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced that it would respond to strong criticisms about its wage practices.
The group of 30 leading leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell before five years.
The actions may be withdrawn from the leaders if they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus taking the lead in the effort to link the payments with long-term performances on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the overall sense to take, indicated the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan's company
The concern is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank has become the target of criticism after it turned to nearly $17 billion for prizes in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion, despite the measure announced today, according to the Reuters agency.
With the financial crisis coming, the strong banking premiums have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it was counting on a single tax of fifty per cent of the bankers' bonuses of over 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have received Nobel prizes in all areas without physical
These are five women, a record number, who today received the Nobel Prizes in Technical and Literature in Stockholm from the hands of the King Charles XVI Gustave of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, with their compatriot Jack Szkotak, received the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemical price was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonathan with American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz to have clarified the structure and function of the ribosomas
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economy, American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that has not been awarded this year was physical.
This prize has been awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently based on all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the cash reward.
It has ten million Swedish crowns in each category. (about EUR 1.1 million)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward between them.
The very expected Nobel Peace Prize has already been handed over to US President Barack Obama this afternoon to Oslo in Norway.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward, since it was only at the beginning of his journey and that he was also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the expense of his policy, he added that in some situations the war was necessary to achieve peace, even if the price was high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Château
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who will make his stay to the government due to his disagreement with the State budget for the following year as voted by the House of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps the position of Janota in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting on Friday.
Klaus also criticises the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which increases the public finances crisis.
This is President Radim Ochtat's spokesman who informed the meeting.
Janoto then wants to discuss his function on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the House of Deputies validated the proposals on the left on money transfers on Wednesday and increased the salaries of officials, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government blamed the proposals of the democratic social partners for going to increase the budget deficit indirectly.
For this reason, a violent dispute was born between the left of one party, the government, Klaus and the right of the other, a dispute that questioned the future of Fischer's firm which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by Members, deletes the package of economic measures passed by the Fischer government and which it considers necessary to claim the State's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but does not have to do so, said today in a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs that politicians have long ignored the "serious problem" of the "unrestricted deficit" of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could improve, if it could rely on a consensus of the wider political parties, according to the president.
The President of ODS Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget is in progress and that the government should challenge its subsequent existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Necza told the ČTK that the idea of an administrative office supported by the ČSSD, ODS and Verts does not work clearly anymore.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer qualified such words as "drastic verdicts".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is expeditious and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD has successfully ratified the State budget for the next year.
The popular party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new movie by Clint Eastwood
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood Invictus film - Invaincu will show the world many things about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story speaks of sports, relationships between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American actor awarded to Oscars, incarnates the film on Nelson Mandela's life, which is unfathomable in combating the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it's a 14-year-old Mandela who asked her to incarnate him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to him, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally..
The 16-year-old actor who was rewarded with a prize for his role in the million Dollar Baby drama of Clint Eastwood, located in the middle of the box, for example, incarcerated the leader of a movement against slavery that became his own slave, a fictitious U.S. president, or even God in the film Evan All-Power but never someone of the honour alive and so important for as many people as Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of the apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
It is an invincible Latin word and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela's joint efforts and the captain of the South African Rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela has recently chosen to know that his country remains and is always racially and economically divided after the apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people by sport and decides to unite the Rugby players who are among the world's guests.
The South African team will make progress in World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story on the screen.
I had no other purpose than to play this role in order to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dinner with him, to be in coulse before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to close his hand.
I realized that when I closed my hand, I recovered from your energy, it passed and I had the impression to know how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard middle of the rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pinaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I dreamed at the door of the house, it opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I have a much bigger eye in the film'.
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus received positive advice from the director of Eastwood, and he even spoke of ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety newspaper summarized his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well realized film."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com site, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: the Russians were testing a rifle
A strange phenomenon of unknown origin above Norway was observed.
The Russian Defence Department recognized only yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was still a failure and the "Bulava" type missile, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence during the fuss tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got hurt in full flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "Miss that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test usually took place at the beginning.
It's only at the end of the flight that there's been damage to the device again.
It's obviously the third floor engine of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" has travelled from the Dmitrij Donskij nuclear submarine that was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can just be fired by a moving and immersing vessel
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably due to a defective "Bulava".
In the rest, the Norwegians did not doubt that this was a Russian shooting.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two floors of the rocket were resistant and the aircraft only touched the third.
In the previous cases, engines have experienced failures on the first floor.
Even though none of the tests had been launched without an increase, the management of the Department of Defence considered that only six to thirteen had failed.
This rate of success of almost fifty percent fills the generals of optimism and therefore they always claim that one day "Bulva" will fly without problems and that it will carry even ten hypersonal nuclear cores of a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at age 51
The legendary Defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again appear in a 51-year-old professional match.
The former world champion, the Olympic champion and holder of Stanley Cup will lend hand-to-hand to his team of the Moscow CSKA in need and will probably make his entry already during the match on Friday against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who completed his career at forty years of age in 1998, is now the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still need to settle some details on the form, says the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by AP.
It has not been specified if the comeback of the legendary hockey player will only concern one match.
I think Fatissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to ice, Fatissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and got 15 goals and 26 assists.
Fettisov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and one of the most successful.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union, he twice decoupled gold in the Olympics, seven titles of the world championship, won Canada Cup as well as the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in NHL where he twice held Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Temple since 2001.
Hyundai listens to the unions and cancels all extra hours
The management of the plant Hyundai de Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional hours.
It is precisely because of the frequent additional hours that the trade unions have declared an emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai factory confirmed it.
The management, however, still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday that worked this year again.
We cannot give up on our production plan, it is essential, that is why additional voluntary hours were proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said Vaněk.
The Sedmiška.cz site indicated that the company offered a 400 Czech crown bonus to the employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded post office for the day worked on 28 November.
According to Vaněk, the company has decided to change how to motivate its employees in exchange for additional hours.
Either they receive the supplement for the additional hours, or they can put a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their holiday ending year-end Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and breakfast.
Given that the extra hours were the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and claims of the trade unions as workers who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management decided immediately to cancel all additional hours for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the employees of the car factory were forced to work almost every day for two additional hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiations between the driving of the car and the trade unions must take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kucharj said on Wednesday that they were ready to end the strike in the event of agreement on their claims and signature of a joint document.
The situation in the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees were spontaneously injured due to additional hours incessantly.
They also protested against the poor wage conditions and alleged fines.
The management defended the fact that employees had to work in addition to filling the car production imperatives.
At the announcement of Monday's strike, trade unions also requested that no sanctions be imposed on workers who had ceased their production.
Trade unions ask society to reduce the time spent in additional hours at least.
In addition, they want a refund of 5,000 crowns this year (209 €) for them.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovici currently employs 2,000 people.
It started production in series last November.
It has manufactured approximately 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that works on HIV "permanent" viruses also
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes, in some cases, the above on the fact that the combination does not work as intensively on the current variants of the virus as well as some medications already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
However, the life of the sick can be extended radically through a mixture of medicines that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption results in a series of secondary effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what is called resistant viruses on which medicines no longer have an effect.
The work of the experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way for dealing with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metal carborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metal carbrans are an assembly of beer, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all medicines used so far, and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their connections to the proteins of the virus.
Metal carborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages are formed by the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon and are connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a HIV virus protein that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease, there would be no occurrence of infectious particles mature in the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, explaining the researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two cassette pairs (see table) are linked by a short organic channel, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of HIV proteases has been tested in tests and its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarbanes is not as strong as on clinical medicinal products, however it does not weaken the resistant versions against which the current medicinal products are often ineffective.
Therefore, with its unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, it is of interest to consider more closely the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Rézáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS is taking over in Fischer, who is defending himself.
The President of the ODS (Democratic Civil Party), Mirek Topolánek, has qualified as the "ffarant" budget ratified for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should challenge its existence.
The Prime Minister has qualified the words of the drastic verdict ODS.
He says to take time to analyze.
The ODS spokesperson Petr Necza stated that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Necza, the head of the government should decide to take care of the House of Deputies in support of the minority who is concerned about combating the growing deficit, or if he is concerned about remaining in his duties with the help of the parliamentary left.
Necza warned that the positions of the ODS and the democratic social partners in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget on Wednesday, however, with proposals for changes of 12 billion crowns included on the left.
The House has increased the money for employees' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government's complaint against the proposals of the democratic social partners was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the Government's wishes as if a modified budget was a lower option than an interim budget.
Deployment and unnecessary
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Neczard is convinced that if Janot threatened to leave his post in case of ratification of the amendments proposals, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota took a meeting with the Prime Minister on Monday after his visit to the government:
He indicated at the same time that he wondered if he would remain in his duties.
His disappointment about the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to address the budget deficit, Necás believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who have imposed the budget changes, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws that increase the deficit, such as those that affect sickness insurance, retirement, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and of the entire government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing harmful, said Topolánek in a textual communication from the United States.
He recalled that the vice-ministers of certain departments were calling for TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Necza pointed out that if Fischer decides to give his resignation in the face of the fact that he is fighting the amount of government deficit, "it is all logical and correct that it is based on the majority of the left that is currently in the House."
This says, he must not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I didn't think about it, and once it's on the agenda, then I will consecrate myself, said from the House to journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government just by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer made an appeal in the afternoon for a debate by the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has taken a step back at the request of the Prime Minister.
Necza stressed at the same time that ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not expressly asked the Democratic Members to allow the budget to vote.
We do not have the feeling of being orphaned, we are not small children, has he responded to the question whether the ODS had failed to respond to the criticisms of the Chairman of the House Party or in the country during the budget negotiations.
I did not notice that my vote would have failed.
I already knew at the time when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the months to come would be a Bolshevik of the House and a destruction of everything that had been positive, Topolánek reacted in person.
According to the new schedules, there will be less trains for identical tariffs.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit from 13 December certain less-charged express or regional trains and will strengthen some others.
The total coverage of transport will decrease on the date of entry into force of the new two percent-times compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic tariffs and reduced tariffs.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino branch.
On the contrary, an expression ceased serving Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the region of Hradec Králové, eight per cent in total, on the other hand, in Prague and its surroundings, can be welcomed by an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the circulation of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will be reduced only a few days a week.
Among the major transformations, one can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the time being, the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esco's banner system, whose opening is possible through the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distance lines towards the capital will have their final destination at the main station of Prague (Praha Hlavní nadraži).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and the Shumperk/Jeseník trains will start at intervals of two hours.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino until Bratislava from December 13th.
The bill this year for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year in all four billion crowns to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate in almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far it has always been a year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not use an increase in the prices of the large majority of transport securities.
Changes will affect only the tickets of a day ČD Net and the eLiška low-price internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The eLiška price will again depend on the route, while it was still valid between the cities of a selected region and was at a single rate of 160 crowns.
The Philippine rebels still hold more than 50 people, the children have been released
The rebels have now taken 75 people south of the Philippines, some of which are students from a primary school and their teachers.
It was the AFP that informed them, but spoke of the origin of 65 hostages only.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The bombing took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human shields when fleeing to the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the army branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP, the police first pursued the rebels following violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The death law was declared in the province of Maguindanao south of the Philippines due to a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre related to the Governor's administration's election there were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the Philippines of the South was arrested following suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential line of the Ampatuan.
Mindanao also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in the US halls in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and tells a part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned apartheid fighter came back to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen for years by Mandela himself to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was assigned to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the movie in the halls, the returns of the critics and the audience are heard.
Nelson Mandela
He was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvesu in South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, in 1993 he then received the Nobel Peace Prize next to Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is on one side fully prepared for the World Cup of Football, and on the other because the media are agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants of the black majority in power.
According to AP, the reactions to the new film are now rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations to the main roles of Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is proud of the film, repeating his own words.
I've dreamed of this long-term role, and I've prepared well.
I have also often personally met Nelson Mandela for power - as we say - to recover from his energy, did he indicate at the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we can remember through the film the personality and message of Mandela.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but this concerns each individual has added to it.
Bringing together the national Rugby team
The film based on the history of British writer John Carlin's novel was freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people depicts the South African defender of human rights during his mandate to the presidency.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying during the film to collect two racial groups of a long-term divided population, and also Nelson Mandela in 1995 was among the national staff of the South African team on the World Cup, which South Africa had won at that time.
Mandela had been long ovated for fourteen years, mainly from the white audience, and was recognized by white people.
Let's hope that the football championship will succeed in reuniting people into one nation, said Rugby Chester Williams, who was the only "black" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the trend in South Africa will improve.
However, South African whites are sceptical as they have recently been entrusted with an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a Rugby fan who has fled to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
A transformer with tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire struck in the morning a transformer from the company Čeps of the distribution centre near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukaš Marvan, a spokesperson for the firefighters in Ústí, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally wanted to let the transformer consume, but they reviewed their opinion and lit the fire with a mixture of water, mussels and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal circuit of the transformer.
No one has been injured, and according to Pavla Mandatova's spokesman, the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the whole transmission.
The damage is estimated to be a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure may be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She added that in ten years of activity, Šeps had no knowledge of anything similar and that the incidents of this type were isolated.
The supply of electricity has not been interrupted, the CEZ spokesperson for the North Bohème Soňa Holingerova Hendrichova, the operation of the homes, administrations and industries has not been affected by the fire of the transformation station.
A.s. Šeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from transport sets to distribution sets and lines of 4339 kilometres long.
Janchura will bring complaints for defamation against three prefects of the ČSSD
Radim Janchura, the owner of Student Agency, will now file a complaint against three democratic social prefects.
And specifically against Michal Haszek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tessarík.
Janchura indicated it in twenty minutes of Radio Journal.
The complaint is linked to the company's attempt to exploit regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of us have attacked and claimed that we are making the ends of our mouths, while we have only made an offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways than what is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So we're only here to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for the slanders on the Student Agency, Janchura said in the Radio Journal.
He has also indicated that there is evidence that no region has taken place in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for this for the European Commission.
Haszek considers that Mr. Janchura's filing of complaints is the result of his media show that serves him as a free publicity for his society and for his person.
I am well aware that I am prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the others to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Janchura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and misleading arguments about regional rail transport, says Haszek.
Janchura has already reported last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the disadvantaged approaches of the regions.
He told Radiojrnal that he had interrupted the campaign after Christmas and that he was counting on it to resume after New Year.
He stated that the campaign would target corruption in the broad sense.
Janchura started its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the railways to the Czech Railways the operation of railways for an order of approximately 150 billion crowns, without calling for tenders.
According to Janchura, such an action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to threats from a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is, but I won't say his name, Janchura said today at Radiojournal.
Vaccination against pneumococcals will be free of charge and optional
The vaccination against pneumococcals will reverse the old habits as of January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute has already defined for vaccines the maximum prices that will be paid for sickness insurance.
Specialists are also clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination was started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will have to be paid on their own.
The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year, about a quarter of the families voluntarily immunized their children against pneumococcals.
However, the parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
Vaccination of younger people requires four doses.
Experts believe that every year the health insurance depends on 300 to 450,000 crowns per dose of vaccine.
However, they save on medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
So far, the State has spent about 500,000 crowns a year for the entire vaccination of children.
The re-vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals are the cause of medium ear inflammation, but also of serious infections such as inflammation of the jaws and poisoning of the blood.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age were caused by pneumonia.
In addition to the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries have introduced the refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on any future vaccination obligation.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it's a direction we need to follow right now, Kalovski said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to modify the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not considering it at all for the moment, said his spokesperson Vlastimil Sršený.
Optional vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Pediatric Specialist Society, acknowledges that a voluntary vaccination based on its defects.
However, if all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the renewal of vaccinations could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such an amount I understand the decision making the optional vaccination" says Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that from next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will be able to immunize their infants.
Pneumococcal vaccination also breaks down because it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not by the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
This is, however, related to the concerns of the practitioners, who are involved in the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to purchase the vaccines by insurance, the doctors receiving them in the same way as the other vaccine products provided by the State.
However, some Members feared that this would allow insurance to "deduce the amounts of sickness insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to pay them back.
It is estimated that the paediatric population will have to invest approximately 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is an important amount.
It'll be far from easy, according to Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Vol de muse"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal tables for a value of $20 million (12 million GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been intercepted while loading 90 tables in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical skin to force the entrance of the museum to the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, aged 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press (AP) press agency.
AP quoted a police officer as saying that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family querell.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52, claimed to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the tables into a storage facility", the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior said that he did not grant such an authorization.
The Labour Force defends the increase in the budget.
Ministers have defended the increase in taxes and reductions in the expenditure announced in the pre-Budget report, despite the criticisms of opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories stated that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that it was serious about the reduction of the deficit by reporting its decisions until the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted the fords by attacking low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals are an increase of 0.5% of Social Insurance and a 1% ceiling on public salaries from 2011.
The anger of Social Insurance
The trade unions protested that low wages were penalized by a recession that they were not responsible and warned that "problems" were being announced.
The decline in social insurance - which will bring about GBP 3 billion per year - has made businesses angry, because it believes it is a job tax while the goal should be a recovery of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than 20,000 GBP a year, will reach about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPLES OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase by 0.5% since April 2011
The economy will drop even more than 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bank bonds
The increase in the tax on the profits of small companies has been abandoned
Discounts of electric cars and wind turbines
Increased withdrawals of 2.5 per cent
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per annum and a person earning 40,000 GBP per annum will lose 190 GBP, while a person earning 10,000 GBP per annum will earn 110 GBP per annum.
The ministers stated that their goal of reducing the deficit by half before 2013 was "hard decisions" but insisted that 60% of the charge of additional taxes would be charged on the first 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, rejected an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in expenditure was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, and they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential in the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that he was confident and that economic growth would resume at the end of the year.
However, the employment forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount it will need to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be completed - have been questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise its first figures.
In his speech, he stated that the economy would probably decrease by 4.75% this year - much worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDPs higher than the preliminary estimate.
"Failure missing"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign today warning against the Labour “debt crisis”, claimed that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, added, "cynically" to the difficult choices until the elections - which should be held in June 2010.
"They presented nothing significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, chief secretary at the Treasury of the Cabinet ghost. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" The important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Force insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from further reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals, which would result in a faster and more significant reduction in the deficit.
But Lib Dems stated that the money collected by increasing taxes and reducing expenditure would be used to support the expenditures of next year and not to reduce the deficit, bearing in mind that the plans were "constructed on the wind".
Nick Robinson, BBC political editor, said that the advertising schedule - such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda charges, and the money was simply recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Force stresses that additional assistance is being provided while people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although the ministers had not published the details of expenditures beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that the restrictions on public expenditures would start to make themselves felt only in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Estudes Fiscales) has stated that the number of Chancellors implies substantial reductions in many areas in the future, including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only reported," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner," said Roger Bootle, Economic Adviser to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report.
The FBI investigates "U.S. arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters, suspected of extremism.
Men were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the US Embassy announced in Pakistan, the BBC.
The FBI stated that it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been declared missing from their home in the United States of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are presented as Pakistani descent, one Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges against them are and under what conditions they are detained," said spoke-word, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, spokesperson for the FBI, stated that the agency had been aware of the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if they are really the students who are missing," she said.
The Embassy of Pakistan in Washington said that men had been arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
She said that the house had already been monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, refused any comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters press agency, but stated that the United States had to "co-operate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to destroy the continuing infrastructure of terrorism to recruit and train people".
The five students had been taken missing from their home by their families, in northern Virginia, at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuse"
Over the past 20 years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International Association report.
the report presents "repeatations of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man quoted in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticisms regarding its non-compliance with human rights.
The authorities have argued that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens were sentenced to prison and prosecutors claimed that at least five people had been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a member of the BBC in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent said.
"Fause confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ibrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook Networks' and protesting the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under the eyes, on the neck, at the head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, always in blood and half conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the candidate for the election, Mehdi Karrubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison and that others had been raped.
The Iranian authorities denied allegations of rape, but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he had been in a container with 75 others, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial system set up a committee to investigate post-election disorders and the Government's response, but it stated that the mandate and powers of these agencies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski tracks built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to transform Bristol's site into a race track.
The eventPiste in the Park (A track in the park) attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for cash prizes.
At the top of Brandon Hill Park, a small tramp was ahead of a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the top view of the track was magnificent but that it was quite intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city squeezing in reverse.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be left to the fountain.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French don't like the crowd" (2006), an elegant and well documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr Bowen's last book presents a much wider and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in the mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what M. Bozen calls "Muslim space" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen to and reproduce discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a mosque (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a banking system based on interests to obtain a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not bring the debate to an end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their lawyers from a clean Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today is a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the laity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
It asks how much French politicians (and the guardian intellectual elite so virulent of laity) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not tortured, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to compromise historically with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "treasure of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The darkest sight of the world
The Arctic changes faster and dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes it is being grounded at an alarming speed, with it carrying a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their village.
In "On a thin ice layer", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, polar bear.
Aware of the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved them by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then bravely yearning for 14 years who had not fought that the point of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bear, captured while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent into zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 hours at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are always a millionth of the surface needed for a free adult. The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to the things that were pushing into its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis related the stories of other writers and historians and often referred to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians in motoski use powerful rifles to hunt their prey.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and clear summary of Arctic science and an overview of what might be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherics nor oceanographers can accurately relate to the rate of change.
You don't have to try.
At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering trips provided the first information on the source of the ice-cream.
The submarines of the cold war then charted the changes in relief under it.
Satellite surveillance and iceberg probes are of great help, but the largest of the work is done by heavy men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson looked at the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice tax system, formed by the salty water threads pressed by ice.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn."
The Marines, among the 6,000 people who deposited crowns on the tombs in Arlington
The first class of De'Angelo Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to deposit a simple crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip to Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Cimetre Arlington National Cemetery for decorating the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who once were in their place.
Within a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about the soldiers who fell.
If that happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same thing for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers to be gathered on Saturday morning to present crowns on the tombs of the veterans, in various sections of the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morril Worcester, owner of Worcester Wread Company in Harrington, Maine, initiated the commemoration and other people decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make each year the trip, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other States.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of the Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for the victims of the Flight 93 of United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation gave more than $150 000 to purchase and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70-year-old Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington in honor of her husband, a late career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had been sacrificed.
It's a little gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she told you.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Emmitted in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the furrows and the extended hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Vietnam War, because they were not as often visited as the new graves, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, while the children were playing and the couple were holding hands, wearing the cool pin crowns on the grey graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red papillone knot on top.
Nearly there was silence in Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan were inhaled.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark mood of the current wars enfolded the area.
Individuals would cry without hiding, other prayers and families and friends would be in cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others were looking to see the small black and white information cards, buried in the wet ground for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears on her son's grave.
She was a part of Zanesfield, Ohio, and had spent eight hours coming to gather on the grave of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in July.
No one should ever forget what we're free from... my son paid for it, she told you.
"For a long time after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American citizen who distributed mobile phones and portable computers in the country, claiming the services of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Alternatives Development Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as U.S. Agency for International Development and World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana try to have access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are married and are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but his authorizations have always been denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase the tensions between the Communist Government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which pursues a "sweet" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward by concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and portable computers are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of a civil servant is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, Internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the rare Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, who is in charge of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information on the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the American Human Rights Watch Group, who recently published a severe report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to Raul Castro's installation as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick elderly brother.
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested, tried and imprisoned the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often reacted negatively to the United States, when the two countries began a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities reviewed a planned plan to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, hoping that this case would enable a large network of recruits from terrorists who are equating the Internet to search for radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after having discovered them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on YouTube video site.
Upon arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah, who tried to help them reach the retreated region of Pakistan's tribal belt, the home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But one representative of Pakistan's secret services who was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince Al-Qaida commanders that these men were not involved in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the north-east prohibited mountains, became a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered to be infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed himself in the condition that the anonymity was maintained because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to obtain entry into the al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of these five men -- who are still in Pakistan and are interrogated by the FBI -- insists on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in determining those in whom they trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, American secret services have had priority to infiltrate men into the al-Qaida network.
The staff members of the organization play the role of barrister guards, refusing to enter into those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may become spies.
According to analysts, potential American recruits are closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups should also be increasingly vigilant, in recent years when choosing the people they accept because American secret services have become experts in terms of their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than following his recruitment model than so many others have already followed?
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protestors in Copenhagen demand a "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of protestors walked in the streets, here on Saturday, demanding more action on the climate of the negotiators working in the Palace of the Bella Convention Center of the City.
The number of demonstrators was estimated to be 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists have lit up some explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On the day that few things happened during the discussions on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists went from the city, deploying banners in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, declaring 'The Earth says it has enough of it'.
Several celebrations joined the protests, including the Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said to travel to her mother's country of birth, Peru, opened her eyes to the problems that have to be addressed by the country because of the impact of climate change that is already taking place."
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the big move -- to put the word through and call on world leaders to make just, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented demonstrators from coming too close to the center of Bella and said that she had arrested 19 people for wearing a mask or having a pocket knife.
The police prevented demonstrators from coming too close to the center of Bella and said that she had arrested 19 people for wearing a mask or having a pocket knife.
According to a passerby who asked to keep the anonymity because of its involvement in climate discussions, activists who wore masks and black clothing have lit several explosives near the main Copenhagen channel, which is surrounded by several departments.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first of all rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palace of Congress, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters failed to raise the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, a representative of China for the climate.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "In fact, that is something I did not know.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring "The event is important, I cannot hear what is going on outside."
He noted that the walk might seem harmful or useful from the perspectives.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal tensions between races
Last week's federal report on the results in mathematics brought good news to the public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the headquarters, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much greater progress over the past two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the recent figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of the Progress of Education) are the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, on both local and national levels.
The average results of grade 4 white children (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. have increased, in the last two years, from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but those of their African-American friends have increased only from three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success has indeed increased between 2007 and 2009, ranging from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling from only one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean result of the blanks was not included in the test results because the sample was not important enough.
The overall view over a period of six years is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between the black and white grade 4 (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results of children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only decreased to 58 points.
Last week, some District defenders expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the Education Group Director Michelle A. Rhee and the Maire, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the assembly by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in the education of the District.
I do not miss the joy of one or two winning points, Kwame R. Brown (democratic apartheid), member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary ( Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's style of management, Brown said that the message of test results is that middle schools (colleges) in the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what's scary is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at schoolchildren from the end of the elementary cycle and early college who have not integrated the basics of the reading earlier in their school course and are late enough compared to their friends.
Every day, the math program, for the classes of Kindergarten (Maternal) at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real life games and experiences, as they were put in place in the District by the former responsible Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think that we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these students at a lower level than that of the class, Rhee said.
Others believe that the results of NAEP raise the question whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, Bruce Fuller, a teacher at Berkeley University in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional policy solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest districts of Washington.
Thus, this target can have political implications that generate this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of schools, she tries to serve as the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our district schools so that all families, wherever they come from, are assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap in success was the length of the traditional public school, today 180 days in the Washington District, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of his teachers last year to get 185 days, that he considers a "start point" to get another increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long silence.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, down and click a moment of sight at the sight of white columns, brick façades and green hairs.
Graciela's parents could only finish the high school in El Salvador.
Just recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Thus, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students of the group explored Gettysburg where the school costs are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less than that of a new, more enthusiastic student.
Super Voilà where I'm going to study! Graciela called who would like to study medicine, while the guide directed them to the entrance to the science building.
Youpi, really? she says dreamy, when you tell her the low ratio of law teacher - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit children during their three-day trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this issue is still widespread for the large number of American children born to Spanish immigrant parents who have left high school where they have become parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands of people who have received university education that will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a hispanic of the "second generation" in five years of his studies in high school -- a remarkable success if it is considered that so many of their immigrant parents, most of them in Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, researchers say, they open the way to the next generations that will play an important role in the country's work.
Researchers who study batants claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an inherent need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention at any time will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about offering a network of support to these children, from the mother to the high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepared for you), it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that start when students from low-income families are in middle school (school) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent entering the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Ministry of Iraqi Oil has agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and Europe's oil companies are about to play a major role in the recovery of Iraq's oil industry, which has been disabled by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies are divided into only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who had put a stake in it has lost.
Two American companies have obtained contracts for the field of auctions in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, they were Asian and European companies opening the way, Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, said a website on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by mass-coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability while American military troops retreated, stopped American oil companies, preventing them from becoming more forceful in Iraq, which has the third largest oil reserve in the world, analysts say.
In some cases, American companies were disadvantaged because of their rivers, in particular Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and were more likely to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, that have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have provided it with their technical advice, are hand-held.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., held by the State, has placed more on contracts than other companies and is distributed with important participation in contracts for two main areas.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesperson of the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be equal to its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The companies selected to submit tenders made offers that were then compared to the rate per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, having hit across the border with Afghanistan, killed one of Al-Qaida operations organizers this week, said on Friday the US authorities of counter-spinning.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second murder attack against one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car on Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles had been fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA within the Anarchical Tribal Border of Pakistan.
They drove a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistani civilian secret services, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
The authorities stated that the suspects' local militants had rushed on site and quickly confiscated what remained of the "completely decapitated bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two American anti-terrorists provided unspecified evidence that Somalia was a part of the dead.
Somalia was described as one of the responsible al-Qaida military organizers who led the terrorist operations of the group outside Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize global plots, said one of the authorities that wished to keep the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directions of Al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority stated that Somalia had made rapid progress in the al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the American public, but this does not diminish the threat he poses for us and our allies, the second official representative said.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second major character of al-Qaida or the second leader of the Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of the attacks by CIA drones has decreased since summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a web site moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability, while also unintentionally killing suspected informants, the site states.
UN special envoy to Kabul withdraws
The UN special envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he was going to resign from his post in March, at the end of a stormy mandate attached to widespread allegations of corruption during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
The departure of Eide takes place when the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said that he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would start in 18 months and which would force other Governments of NATO to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the good signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a Kabul phone interview.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international officials supporting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he did not resign but that he would simply respect the commitment he had made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already begun looking for a replacement.
The representatives say that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been quoted; it is a citizen of Italo-Switzerland who recently chaired a United Nations mission to Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, the accused in September, to encourage President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and to disprove the evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which were thanked -- "have hurt the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism in respect of international election observation."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the support of the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the United Nations Representatives to allow their successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than he had been assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money was spent.
Eide expressed his frustration about the limits of his power in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy United Nations employment regulations had given him opportunities to bring new talents.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must be subject to additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the major world powers were about to impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of his inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a 300-military party in northern Iraq, during a week's visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, detached the possibility of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such a delay.
One of the things that weighs on me most is that if I learned something in Iraq over the last six years, it's the unpredictable side of the war.
The Obama administration considered a set of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He stated that "a set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to convince the Iranian government that it would be in fact less safe with nuclear weapons" because "his people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probably" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of his enrich uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has promoted such an agreement, a way of developing confidence on both sides and making time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has appeared to have been away from attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided into whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my opinion, Iran's redistribution to some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually given their agreement at the beginning of October has moved the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they had not considered, in terms of additional important sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set 31 December as a deadline for responding to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called increased sanctions.
In a statement made on Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations stated what it called "unsubstantiated allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington late Friday morning, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for the rich Kurdish oil region to meet with the troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
There are still tensions between Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid all delays in the US plans to reduce the number of American troops from 115 000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the anxiety of the Kurds about the suspension. The American authorities have quoted Gates in Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and your autonomy in a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you."
In aging China, a change in direction
Wang Wejiia and her husband were surrounded by propaganda shows, saying, "The Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An extra baby, it's an extra grave".
They learned so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate of their city and the ageing population, radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no second left, Wang said, 31 years old, Director of Human Resources and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child's policy in China, creating two generations of unique children with a great deal of good games and jokes, named the "Empressive Smalls", a crisis in the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell by 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
Population distribution, while the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a very educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Shanghai Municipal Population Commission and Family Planning) stated that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of work in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "so old - but not as rich, however - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual slowdown
The Chinese policy of the single child, written in the constitution of the country in 1978, is to date the most controversial obligation imposed by the Communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some authorities forced pregnant women from a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to a ratio of boys - girls abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually improved their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and the cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they have made many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that the central government authorities recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, the posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorisation.
The city's government has launched family planning and volunteers to meet couples at their home, and to cast prospectors at their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who wished to have more than one child.
According to the family planning manager, the response was disappointing.
Disagreemental response
Although officials in a rural town in Shanghai's banelieu said they saw an increase in requests for couple files wishing a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, always receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, claim that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be about 165,000 -- slightly more than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the municipality of Caoul de Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don't want to have any more children.
They want to have their first child, she told you.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, stated that they would have two children and that they were legally authorized there.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The West consider the policy of the only child to be a problem of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant for seven months from the first child of the couple.
It's true, we're taking the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples quote psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she only wanted a single child because she was one of her own. "We were the center of the family and had the habit of everyone taking care of us."
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company said it more thoroughly.
For couples working in two, middle class, who lower the birth rate, he said, it must be selfish to succeed.
People 20 or 30 years of age grew up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he said.
Even one child asks a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best maternal."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has plans for emission reduction
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations, which has so far been characterized by unorganized assignments and mutual reprisals, has come under the light of the Friday disaster, as a result of the publication of a document highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialised nations with most of the burden in the coming years.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases highlighted the remaining obstacles, as long as it clarified the path to take.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Drafted by a United Nations special working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support climate warming, in the course and in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how the developed economies and emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that the managers would be prepared to tolerate.
He gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequiyt, Representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who prepared six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary described on the climate change of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, as "the complete image".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also resumed negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to support floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal alterations took place, which dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, U.S. Representative for Climate Negotiation, rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if these were not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that Obama's administration has become harder to China than Bush's administration had been, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments one hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei said that the main American negotiator, either lacking "good sense", was "extremely irresponsible" to have said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to combat climate warming.
With the future economic trajectorys of the major world powers at stake, both in the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States, while the poorest nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegation from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to know who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major issuers responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, Ulate said, which is also the Climate Adviser for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure on obtaining a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that negotiations will lead to a political agreement at least.
The Small Island Alliance, which brings together 43 members, drew up a 24-page treaty proposal on Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, Head of the European Commission's Climate Unit, said that the action of small island States has "put a political pressure on the full political process", in part because they are now unified and ask emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debate became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems in the forum before the heads of government reached agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Minister of the Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister of the Environment were down from their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend home-close meetings and information conferences in order to be able to make claims that will be studied during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palace of Congress every day -- of guitar players present night performances that mock, betray, and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by e-mails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity only increases: almost all important ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the Grand Court, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the World Conservation Policy, said.
Heavy weights are coming.
In Great Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a sifflet blow will be lost at night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Great Britain.
The first high-speed tram train in the country will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, in Kent, London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin train outside London.
He hoped that the new service would enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and the Scotland in London.
The small holes lost will become flourishing flag cities, the length of business trips will be much less long and the passage of the plane and the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties adhered to this project.
But the ten billion books needed to build a new iron network, the inevitable planning battle, and the fear of danger to the environment are likely to slow down the British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to make a feasibility report for the government, will make its document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new London-West Midlands line will be drawn in the five metres of the urban area and sites where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be designed up to 25 metres from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 has three options for a high-speed network going north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The privileged options are advanced in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will be separated in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch going west of the Pennins in Manchester and Scotland and another going north-east, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When this is over, the time to travel between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour's journey at present.
The proposals will allow the train to travel to 400km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial track is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and can transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be enlarged to receive the high-speed network.
The experts in the rail industry say that only St Pancras International or Euton offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if the machine is launched, the network will have to be built part by part.
First of all, trains will be forced to roll out of high-speed lines on the trains that exist in northern Birmingham, retaining travel time between London and Scotland over three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a train passage, which is a reference point for the rail revolution.
The taxpayers repay the loan of GBP 75,000 for Tory's Orange.
Alan Duncan, the principal member of the Tory Parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of books a year to reimburse the cost of an orange that he built in his home of his district.
The party's responsibility that David Cameron has been re-enacted to complain that the members of the parliament were "maintained", increased his loan of GBP 75,000 to build a chain extension to his second house in Rutland.
It had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of books per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Läg, who carried out a control of the members' expenditures. Last night, Mr Duncan said that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of the parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in the county of Rutland - Melton.
The nearby homes were sold for nearly a million books.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Emotional Office says that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange.
The neighbors describe it as "a veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on the Privileges and Standards of the Commons regarding its prior loan arrangements.
The Committee indicted him last month for any non-compliance with the rules, following an investigation into his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan modified the legal security of the 271,406 GBP of his London property at the house of his district he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately 1,400 GBP per month of loan interest until March last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at the time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75,000.
The standard interest rate variable RBS increased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving ever since.
The latest publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Chief of Staff in a ghost cabinet in September, after a reporter under cover filmed him saying that members of parliament had to survive "on the budget" after the cost scandal.
"In fact, it's national now, you have to live "on the budget" and you've been treated as "from m... and"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
and I could have asked for more, but I didn't."
The member of Parliament, a millionaire since his former post as a oil negotiator, began to explain his expenditure in May, after he appeared to have asked for thousands of books for his garden, before he agreed with the office of charges that this could "be regarded as excessive".
An activist raised a £3 hole in M Duncan's hair to protest after it was revealed that he had requested £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the loan, last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for capital improvements, both approved by the office of charge and then by Legge."
He added: "There is no problem with the processing or use of the rules or whatever.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn't be simpler or simpler."
Faithful, come all to see Brighton's Adventure Calendar
Brighton beach cabins have found a new means of promotion for the winter months, an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, a group of the alternative church that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for every December day, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17:30 to 18:30, every day, with pasta and hot wine served for free.
The Noel songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a Howe's assistant TV marketing assistant, is an unremunerated priest of Chichester diocese and Beyond Director.
He said: "We wish religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should approach people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the adventure calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate
Tens of thousands of people protested on Saturday to seek an ambitious and binding agreement on combating climate warming throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police conducted several hundred intermissions.
At least 30 thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, showed in the cold in the Danish capital, on the side of the United Nations Climate Conference, which is responsible for reaching an agreement on Friday, which may enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization of climate across the world, illustrated by these events, has contributed to making a very high "political price" failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the court, when a group of 300 demonstrators, fully dressed in black, broke windows with straws and hammers, a AFP journalist observed.
Anti-Semitic police officers were immediately involved without a home.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to the members of "Black Blocs", these ultraviolent groups, which were illustrated in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were called "without distinction", stressing that one hundred of them "were always held in the street on Saturday night "menetized and kept in position despite extreme cold".
Part of Parliament, the court, rather a good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, the negotiating site.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without trying to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a guard to the candles with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters came in and out of large cities in Europe, but many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for most of the waterproof blue sky, had formed a first assembly in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue seams" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down to the streets to ask for environmental debt repairs for the South, Lidy Nacpil, a Philippines militant from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen explained.
We can't continue to say that we have time, we've considered the singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers that settle in Africa, watercourses where we can walk as never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alternative-worldist movement approached environmental organizations.
French MP José Bové, a figure of internationalism, explained that he had come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut-off between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which has many particularly vulnerable islands for heating, had given the launch of the demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had gone down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for most of the time, were shown reddishing bandits with solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred protestors were also held to demand an energy action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
A few dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazie elected his president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russia separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilissi denounced a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in this first vote after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war for the control of the South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 1700 GMT.
The participation rate was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure, according to the Abkhaze Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on Saturday night on Sunday.
The five high-ranking candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the poll.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "regrett that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia", said his spokesperson Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of the territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After being separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which caused several thousand deaths, Abkhazia seeks to demonstrate through this election that she is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was among the electors who went to the polling office in a school in Soukhoumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidency in this region in the rainy landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch next to the President and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, has reserved a warm welcome for Russian officials to monitor the conduct of the poll.
We, the people of Abkhazia, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered by raising a vodka glass.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the vote by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two business men, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements with Moscow last year, as the one giving Russia control over the railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% more than one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: World events, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people went to the world on Saturday to claim an ambitious and binding agreement to the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the living side, questioned nearly 700 people on the side of an impressive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, showed in the cold the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliament's party, the Court of Justice, a generally good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, where negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped at about 500 metres from the center, without trying to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a guard to the candles with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the departure of the court, a group of several hundred protesters, fully dressed in black, munitions of brick and hammers, broke windows, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-Semitic police officers immediately surrounded them and intervened without a home, throwing several of them on the ground.
The police announced the interception of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mostly members of "Black Blocs", these ultraviolent groups, which were illustrated in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a policeman was injured by a spider and four cars on fire near a squad during incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to the police.
We have in our eyes the extremist groups, had prevented the police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the forces of the order were in heaven.
Most of the protesters, who came in and were in the process of the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for most of the waterproof blue sky, had formed a first assembly in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue seams" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down to the streets to ask for environmental debt repairs for the South, Lidy Nacpil, a Philippines militant from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen explained.
We can't continue to say that we have time, we've considered the singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers that settle in Africa, there are water courses where we can walk when we've never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alternative-worldist movement approached environmental organizations.
French MP José Bové, a figure of internationalism, told the AFP to come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut-off between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organization mobilized several personalities, including the Danish mannequin Helena Christensen, the former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who had to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which has many particularly vulnerable islands for heating, had given the launch of the demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had gone down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for most of the time, showed, red clothes and drumming bandanas with solar energy in front of the capital of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, a few hundred protestors were also held to demand action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
A few dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
The geo-history is strengthened by the reform of the general lycee, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were "strengthened" in the reform of the general lycea, despite the deletion of their compulsory education in a scientific terminal.
Now, the first students will have every four hours of the week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the Minister, "you have to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S thread is no longer a scientific thread" but "in large, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L branches cannot remain a subsidiary of the S, he goes on to say: "I have not heard much of historians and intellectuals in the absence of terminal history in technology lycees."
On Saturday, a survey of Ifop published in Humanity revealed that nearly seven French out of ten (69%) rejected the government's project to eliminate mandatory education in the S-terminal history. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this deletion, as well as the left and certain right choices.
On the other hand, the Minister added that it was not "no question" to delete the philosophy of the S terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a Tuesday mobilization day to protest against the project, which they said sacrificed the teaching training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will cover their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will cover their teaching ability, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will follow courses in situations during the year of M2 and will be a first year in front of the students as trainees.
If you add all the courses proposed before the competition, you will already get more presence in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, has it continued.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the project to delete the school card "from 2012".
A Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince you about the weather
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues of the Copenhagen Summit: it was the challenge that was raised on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) invited by the Upper Normal School of Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also at the Nobel Peace Prize, opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day that consisted of a series of interviews by experts, 15 minutes each, filmed and open to the public, observed an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that caught people and gave them a desire to know more about it, explained in the margins of the Edouard Hannezo conference, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day who takes his name from that given by the students to the fish at the school pool.
Twenty participants are selected from the experts of their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, it has been specified.
With regard to climate heating, "you can talk about hours, but you can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but with graphics, in front of fifty people.
This is part of our role as scientist, he stressed, hoping that audiences will hold that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific dossier".
Videos drawn from these conferences will be posted on the school's website from 15 December.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled in February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delays in payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
The prison supervisors' unions called Friday for "general mobilization" to require the payment of additional prizes and hours by the end of the year for which payment was made in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-Penitario (2nd Supervisory Union) asked staff who would not be in service to manifest themselves in front of and "block them" in the morning to "denominate the flight of their dunes".
The Penitentiary CGT (3rd Professional Union) calls for "to meet in general assemblies in different prisons for strong mobilization", judging as "hont and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "additional hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first supervisory union, the federal autonomous penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the additional hours have increased considerably in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that the balances will be paid in January.
The Chancellor stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent an e-mail to the monitoring unions to ensure that this payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts made by staff to operate and modernise our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I asked the management of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation caused by a poor assessment of the number of extra hours does not reproduce in the future, added Ms. Alliot-Marie.
Thus, the December pay will be increased, except for management staff who receive famed functions and goals, and has deplored Ufap/Unsa, for which "budgetary constraints have a good back".
It is a pure scandal, the interregional FO union of Marseilles, announcing its decision to boycott to the new order "all meetings and calls".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, an additional hour's journey, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
At a time when our tasks and missions are increased without increasing our staff, it is more than regretful to wear them to the staff's money, the CGT penitentiary of Bordeaux believes.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less bad lotus than others.
However, the account is not in any way, the Secretary-General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget, noted.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "sweeter tricks" than those he receives
American President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas family at the White House, entrusted the little Oprah Winfrey's "father" screen with a simple gift rule: "I give more things than I receive."
As part of a special issue that will be broadcast on Sunday night on the ABC channel, the president and his wife, Michelle, offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious stay.
Even Bo, the little four-legged partner of the family will be on the side.
Father Noël also likes Bo, so said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would "surely" have a gift, according to the results of the broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama was wrong about her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he received: "Of course not, I offered you some nice gifts last year," she struck the president.
Is it absolutely necessary to give up before humour by showing the First Lady's pearl necklace with the finger: "Who offered you this?".
During this one hour's broadcast, in the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous animator who was a firm support of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball ball that his father kenyan had rarely seen offered him in Christmas.
I remember this time I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball ball, the president said.
It's only later in my life that I realized it was him who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her house.
I didn't really know how to organize a house so I aligned all the furniture against the wall rather than arrange them around the fireplace, but I loved this little house of dolls, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL asserts that he is in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reoperated in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "in control" according to his surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reopened on Wednesday night to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors had found "the resulting injury from the operation" of the discal hernie in Paris on 26 November, indicated in Paris its press service, stating that these injuries had "needed a repair operation".
The singer's press service, however, wanted to reassure itself that the situation was "in control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be issued no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the last singer tour, however, Johnny Hallyday would have been thrown into an artificial coma to avoid "pangs and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, adds RTL.
Questioned by the AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to certain sources" no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of the Monceau Park for this discal heritage.
The intervention, programmed for several days had been practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajaux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
This was not available on Thursday night to comment on RTL information.
Following his surgery on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles for a subsequent intervention infection.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, believed Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but made sure he didn't "any interest" in the rocker, which is "a beater".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him that it was a connexion because twelve hours after that operation, it's not playful, Eddie Mitchell said.
Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to be reassured, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "abundant".
Mr. Camus had also said that he had stayed with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated by a "small colon cancer", then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer repeated his "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been very well reported. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the singer to move on stage.
In mid-November, his tour even had to detract from a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/Small Bass: Bousquet's first on its fetish distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, three-folded world bassier 2009, announced on Thursday an international title on a distance that it particularly affects, the 50 m free swim, during the Euro-2009 small bass in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time has only seen three records of the world beat while waiting for a deferral.
One has been improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 knots and the other two by Russia in relays 4x50 m 4 knots.
A regret for Bousquet, who was looking for the world record of 50 m free, with the mark in large bass (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of the swimming, the 50 m free, is the 28-year-old French who was imposed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took off against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet advanced Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had considered.
We can always dream better and at the same time, I had said that if the world's record was at my disposal, I'd try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
At the beginning of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their era in Istanbul, which had received the first in 1999, at the same competition.
The use of combinations was not used this time in German Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in large bass this summer in Rome, records of the world at the key.
The young swimmer did not succeed in lowering the mark he had on 400 m free swim (3:32.77) but was nevertheless forced by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola adjugégé 1.5 million USD
A Romanian sarcophagus panel belonging to the French writer Emile Zola has been awarded $1.5 million on Thursday, clearly above his estimate, announced the art merchant Sotheby's.
This panel, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decoration, surrounded by satires and bakers, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," explained AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the arts auctions of the Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
He was sold in a hundred batches.
The sale is still in progress, but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have the most purchased so far, has indicated to the AFP a spokesperson of Sotheby's, Dan Arnethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel stayed close to 300 years in Rome in the famous Borghese family collection, and then appeared next to the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it a part of his bathroom in his particular Parisian hotel, and Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic of France and briefly President of the Council before the entry into power of the Marchan Petin.
It's been a shadow zone for 50 years.
By searching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Eile Zola Succession" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Therèse Raquin" and the fresh one of the "Rougon-Macquart".
An attempted departure from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer on its territory of the deputed President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who had refused to be a free conduct by the Puschist government.
For the time being, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, it seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
On Wednesday, to bring Mr. Zelaya back to Salvador, the Mexican government plane was assigned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "deputy" and to ask for political asylum abroad to grant him a free conduct.
But the deputed president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as the guest head of state.
The Putschist government "has experienced a new failure in wanting me to give up my position (...), they wanted me to resign," said Thursday Mr. Zelaya on the Globo radio, which he has often expressed since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing a few agreements with the late President, who has been refugees to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico has presented us with a request for rescue, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, said on Wednesday the Minister of Interior of the Puschist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, on the HRN Honduran radio.
I did not ask for asylum in any country, had answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur chain, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras would have to become the president of the Hondurasan people, he had stressed.
The outgoing speakers of Mr. Zelaya had mobilized on Wednesday the participants of the deputed president, who had come to gather around the Brazilian Embassy, where the soldiers had strengthened their seat.
The Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Puschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government with regard to international standards, he felt.
Zelaya, who had approached the Venezuelan socialist president Hugo Chavez, was brought back on 28 June, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare his re-election against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on September 21 and fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he succeeds, he will be arrested to respond to the crime of "high treason" against which justice is charged, according to the Puschist government.
President Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organizing a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the contested vote recognized by the United States but challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street mounts, the US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday, the U.S. trade balance figures testifying to the resumption of both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced from 68.78 points to 10,405,83 points, and Nasdaq, a technologically dominant, from 7,13 points to 2,190,06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has been adjusted to 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, Lindsey Piegza, from FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, it is temperamental, considering that the market focused on "the glass at half full".
For Peter Cardillo, Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the US trade balance, "which show that the activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The trade deficit in the United States fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared to September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts were expected to reverse an increase in the deficit.
Imports that exports have also increased.
The great news is the growth of trade volumes, particularly for exports of goods, which reflects the growth of economies of the major trading partners in the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, the new unemployment registers in the United States have increased against any expectations last week to reach 474,000 applications.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new jobseekers "has fallen to the lowest in one year", said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The return of Treasury assets to 10 years has increased to 3,482 per cent against 3,423 per cent on Tuesday night and to 4,492 per cent against 4,408 per cent on the watch.
Cuba: Hundreds of power participants earn the "White Ladies"
A few hundred Cuban power-partisans concurred on Thursday of the political prisoners' wives gathered in Havana for the World Day of Human Rights, and prevented another event for which tens of dissidents were interned.
A quarter of "White Women", married or close to political prisoners, were arrested in the street by Raul Castro's government supporters as they marched to the capital centre to claim the release of political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Down the Yankees!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" were scanning, the raised point, the partisans of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who came "insure their protection".
The guard, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also learning to manifest themselves on Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights were, interned by police officers in civilian, found an AFP journalist.
Policemen have forced dissidents into civilian vehicles who have been recruited by government participants, according to this journalist.
Dissident interferences in similar circumstances generally last only a few hours.
The recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "White Ladies" had set up an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", in the number of 200 according to the dissident, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda spent 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda was part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remained under the spells.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "merceners" or "agents" to the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
In short, Cuban television reported on the demonstration of Thursdays of pro-government militants against "revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forced killer kills an octogenaire at the knife and hurts 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed two-piece force killed an octogenian and injured five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Houts-de-Seine), at an hour of affluence, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the attacker, aged 28 years, would have hit with two knives and for unspecified reasons, an octogenaire, either in or in front of a 85-bulevard Jean-Jaurès pharmaceutical, learned from police sources and witnesses.
Grievely injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to a chief of the Alliance police union, died at the hospital following his injuries.
In or before this same drug, he then took it to a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, who was 30 years old, interfered and was injured.
The first two victims, severely injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenaire had collapsed.
The days of the other injured are in danger, and vital organs are apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then made a malaise and would have been hospitalized "in a state of shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then flee into the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have injured two passersbys, apparently by chance: a thirty-one and a quadrean, the last cry.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two mouthpieces that he was wearing behind his back, explained on the spot a union chief Alliance in the Highs-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
A number of passersby, including young people, have tried to control the forces, according to evidence collected by the AFP.
I've seen a guy in his 30s with a green dress.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was expensive, said Alberto, the server of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a local police officer who broke his arm, he added.
At the height of No.61, Jean-Jaurès, two municipal policemen, including their leaders, were still trying to imprison the armed man and were wounded at gunpoints, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passers came to tell me there was a wounded person outside.
I left, I saw a 70-year-old on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important plague on the abdomen, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person arrived about thirty years later, injured at knife cuttings.
These are national police officers who arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Parquet took over the investigation the departmental judicial police service of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The officer was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in the context of his guardianship.
A police source has not excluded him from being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, he needed six police officers to control Clichy's police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of exhilaration" as "all the forces of this species whose forces decompose under the influence of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer once again claims abandoning the prosecution
The French-Polish film lawyer Roman Polanski once again called for a new Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), abandoning the persecution against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a death case of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the "Pianist", denounced three judges in the appeal court of the second district of California as serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
I demand that the charges be dropped here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge responsible for the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- deceased since -- would have discussed, before making his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious procedural failure.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally said at the end of September that he had "false" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court would refuse to give up the prosecution, Mr Hummel applied for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution has reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no discharge of charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski was brought before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, prior to his sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He's never been walking to the United States since.
The Deputy Prosecutor of the County of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "should be here to present himself to the audience".
In this case, would you like to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to leave?, asked Mrs. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "requests favor to the court, while contempting her authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that there were "other options to flee".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for abandonment of the persecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the prosecutions.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed for each rebonding of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure has been just.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to residence in his Gstaad cottage, waiting for any extradition.
Wall Street ends with no direction, suspended by the increase of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended with no direction on Friday, in a market scored between better indicators than expected in the United States and the increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63% but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is mounted from 65,67 points to 10,471,50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technologically dominant, has left 0.55 points to 2,190,31 points.
The standard & Poor's 500 extended index has progressed from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, Mace Blackxilver, from Marblehead Asset Management, noted.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of exchange has become very low and I think it will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which " contributed to improving the market's opinion on the robustness of economic recovery", summarizing the analysts of Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month of viewing and much more than expected.
In addition, the confidence of American consumers rose significantly in December to 73,4 against 67,4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indexes have been suspended by a new increase in the dollar, at the top of two months in front of the euro, which has "beset down the sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation", said Owen Fitzpatrick, from Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost the ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury's return to 3,540 per cent went against 3,482 per cent on Wednesday night and the 30-year-old to 4,497 per cent against 4,492 per cent on the watch.
Miss World's Election Again in South Africa
After a month of banishment across South Africa, 112 candidates under Miss World learn to break the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great Mass of Beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already disembarked their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Miss sports or Miss top model during their African stay.
That was a real tourbillon.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cap, was amazing.
I've seen so many things and I've had so many experiences.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, has been broadcast on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (1500 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to give up my crown.
This experience has been fascinating.
I am happy to have lived twice, notes Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the Australian summer.
For young Russians, their second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with candidates and the rediscovery of "landscapes to cut the breath in this country".
After a month of galas, repetitions, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss now focuses on the competition.
The Indian Poja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and presents this election, as well as those of Ashwarya Rai in 1994, both becoming Bollywood stars.
It is the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful of the world, but it is nothing but the appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our country and I want to go home with the crown, launch Miss India with a big smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will score this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costumes and of course in bathrobes.
The show will be animated by a TV shower, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a member of Miss Monde Steve Douglas's committee.
South Africa has shown that she knew to welcome the world with a heat and pride that it is difficult to compare, assures Julia Morley, president of Miss Monde.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time on bicycle, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma, who closed their hands.
Not running for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will no doubt remain the lead in Cape (South-West) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to promote a little more event.
I've frequented people I never thought I could approach.
I'm sure I'll be back for the World-2010, excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," assured his son David on Friday at Los Angeles Airport, where he had to go to his father's head hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it happens very well, said at the press David Hallyday at his departure from the plane that took him to Paris shortly after 1300 locals (21H00 GMT).
The son of the singer, the detained air, assured him that he was going to become "too fast" at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a subsequent infection with a discelle inheritance operation on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was "put in artificial coma this night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and being able to administer his treatment," the press service reported.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed as an artificial coma by the doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for a subsequent infection in the operation of a discal inheritance on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be reopened on Wednesday night to Thursday due to major injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade was educated to attend a school show, found a photographer from the AFP.
The head of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitie-Salpétrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would return to Los Angeles on Monday with the singer.
The producer has violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajaux, the neurosurgian who operated the singer on 26 November at the International Clinic of the Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were pregnant, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believed that Johnny Hallyday was "too fast for Los Angeles, with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this on-line doctor who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and that was a shock to me, since I had myself two Discalhernies, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "drain-free, nothing" after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajaux is very well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before his death in a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also operated Actor Charlotte Gainsbourg to recover a hematoma from a brain hemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor of sulphurous reputation, convicted on several occasions by justice, in medical records, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the attorney of the Order of the Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" pursuing "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and who is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajaux expressed himself on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well done" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not need a drain," he added.
In any event, the singer's turn, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems to be between parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8th (in Amiens, dlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association increases the tone and sums up the New Centre to no longer use its seal
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, responded on Friday to the OPA's attempt by the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the seal of the former Giscardian party, putting it in place to no longer use it on any support, subject to judicial proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to regain the UDF seal, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after holding his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to the NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand for having been the first to deposit it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday night, the UDF Association office, controlled by friends from François Bayrou who do not intend to settle down, came out of silence to launch a stay with the Minister and the MP, summarizing that they no longer use the seal and pass on the brand's property to them, without judicial prosecution.
You have multiplied, these last days, the statements indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement to +recover+ the UDF seal, write the association in a mail signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Alliance.
You also believe it is good to follow on your militant equipment and on the watch page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the slogan + the UDF today+, also detects the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this seal, explains the UDF office that keeps the NC to remove "the name of the UDF from any support as well as from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transmit the property of (the) mark to its legitimate owners".
If you did not do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF adherents, the signatories prevent.
In their mail, they state that the UDF "is a full political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "chosen" to leave in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The new centre therefore has no right, according to them, to use the UDF seal (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 for its accession to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
With regard to Hervé de Charette, he continued the office, "because he filed the mark", he was not "more UDF adherent for three years", but at the UMP.
He uses scandalously and fraudulently the absence of the UDF acronym deposit to do so for his own account.
This indelicacy is becoming a crime, condemning them, before ironing on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name by itself than to try to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as accused by the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he benefited from a state of weakness of the octogenaire for spoiling a part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photographs of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a fine of a maximum of three years imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case due to a saga on one of France's richest families, in which the mother and the daughter are divorced while holding the ruins of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th Chamber of Correction also ordered that a medical expert from Liliane Bettencourt, 87, should be conducted jointly by three doctors.
The principal heir and shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Park during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will be required to report before 10 March 2010 in particular if Liliane Bettencourt has been in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she'll submit.
I'm going to talk to her about it, she told her lawyer, Ms. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, at the hearing.
For his part, lawyer Françoise Bettencourt- Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent new one (...) The expert will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this old lady to be protected, he has said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has engaged in criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and touch-and-touch artist, who accused her of having enjoyed her mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros of gifts, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's tables.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, which she considers to be a long-standing friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' complaints sometimes turned to the major family debacle on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer stated three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said that she was complaining about the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to him since his marriage."
For her part, Nanterre's parquet once again considered that the complainant was not eligible for action, as much as a judge of all of them has refused to do so these last days to apply to open a judicial protection procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has the full capacity to act in justice, she is not protected and has no guardian.
No one else has any action to take," said the representative of the public ministry, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would be decided once the trial had taken place on Ms. Bettencourt-Mayers' admissibility.
Management revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the great French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large enterprises for the purpose of its employees reminds us of the position of businesses for consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to make employees adhere to high-value "values" as it used to be, to impose on consumers the products thought of by factory technicians.
By putting the customer in the company's heart, the marketing revolution has returned the procurement strategies to the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products on customer preference factors returns regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a mortifying demobilization.
The suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects the frameworks in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the company's intellectual functions, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE "needs a proactive approach and a prospective vision from all stakeholders (...) ; it requires on the part of employees a commitment that the revenue of authoritarian management totally contradicts.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the centre of the business's concerns to the same degree as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Internal opinion surveys – like the questionnaire submitted by Orange to his employees – will they encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I have found that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally comes, after a lot of riots, to do what she has always done.
- Then, because of authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simple vision of human behavior.
Because of the great engineering schools, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently re-activated by the United States and widely disseminated "neuronsciences" by the study institutes and the media.
Thus, suggesting that the "leviers" (sic) of the commitment of the leaders are possible, a recent survey of Ipsos in Le Figaro.fr comforts the leaders in a position of mechanical governance, which is not adapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises is supposed to adopt a finalistic vision of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental statement: for employees, the commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it clearly appears to be a means of achieving part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the Motivation Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they judge their businesses by relying on a fixed doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and return their human resources management to "the place".
They thus create a favourable area for concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: the "just war" is worth praise to the right in Obama
The U.S. law welcomed the speech delivered on Friday in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives, who had awarded the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, praised this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, a former candidate for the Vice-President during the 2008 elections.
I loved what he said, said Mrs. Palin, head of the right wing of the Republican party, to the daily USA Today, adding that she had addressed the theme of the war "sometimes necessary" in her memories that have just been published.
The war is well aware of the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists all over the place, and she's in love with you.
Mr. Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, used Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, believed that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really good, and congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential talk.
On the other hand, I found this historic speech, said Gingrich, interrogated at the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected, considered by some as a potential candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to have seen "a left-wing president" recalling members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a price of peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, the former pen of George W. Bush, a chronician at Washington Post, Mr. Obama spoke "a very American speech".
In addition to being present in "citizen of the world" as "he always does," "he spoke as an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it," said Mr. Gerson.
Among the rare to the right not to be convinced, a Bush-era faucon, former UN ambassador John Bolton, has described the speech as "black, ampoule and without inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
At the left of the President, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When we wrap up the war in the sense of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocents, he warned us.
However, the Gauche press remained commendable at the president's place.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize had been given to Mr. Obama in advance, qualified his speech as "superproduction" even for a well-known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should be used as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the California daily burned down.
Mr. Obama "received the speech he needed," said the New York Times, judging him as "both dark and building".
Routes: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three negotiations-marathon meetings, road trade unions and TLF, the sole patron organization to remain until the end of the day, came to an agreement on Friday evening that put an end to the word of strike and the heavy threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing meeting on Friday night, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" this agreement, after several negotiations, began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the text of the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And the same if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had shut the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting beginning at 1100 so that everyone would agree and that the text would be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very harmful to businesses" and "it was to be feared that he had come to disrupt the end-of-year parties," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in salaries of 4% for the lowest (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
At an hourly rate, for low salaries, "we're going from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not a big deal, but we're going a long way, Patrick Clos (FO) explained.
Either we're going to order our militants that there are no locks, no locks at the malls.
But we can always have some recalculators that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, praised "a good agreement", even though he was "hard to grant increases in higher wages in view of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be EUR 170 per month for low wages and EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
This is the agreement of good sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) greeted "historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revalidation of the travel costs of 3%, and the maintenance of the general condition of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will enable, inter alia, the question of 13 months and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending financial law for 2009, voted on by the National Assembly on Thursday to Friday night.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote “in an identical manner”.
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to apply for the first time to companies which are members of this organization, and for the second time, to all professions, in the case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
She will become "in the shortest time," said Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denouncing a " ash market", as the 100 million euros "have already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to contradict the food of the next wake, Unostra said.
For the other, the agreement is "to increase the fall of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this week-end, discontent unions of RATP proposals
The disturbances on RER A, France's largest urban transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday to the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and management of the RATP left them hungry for their premium application.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m., due to a train on two over the central section (between the Defence and Nation) and a train on four outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Gallery, which awaits 200,000 customers every day, was pleased that "RATP makes efforts to serve the big shops".
RER A across the west is the Parisian agglomation.
The short RATP section of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one train on two has circled at the point of the hour, and almost no branch in grown hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no cohue on which the Franciscans were organized.
In the early morning, the St. Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, especially because of the absence of colleges and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), a 29-year-old engineer, Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "a thirty-hour earlier, to be sure to arrive at the time".
The Saint-Lazare Station did not know the saturation, the SNCF indicated, which had planned a leadership of agents and forces of the order.
The RERs operated by the SNCF in origin or towards Cergy-Le-Hout arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general meetings of strikers will take place on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged "major" by the trade unions, from a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of R & D proposes to negotiate a specific R & D protocol on all aspects, working time, career, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who claim a prize due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put its proposals for parentheses, infuriated the CGT, stressing that the management "was not prepared to solve a problem while in the road and SNCF it was done".
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a broader review of the working conditions", RATP specified.
What also told the trade unions that the company "smoothed users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a headquarters committee in Paris.
It was then that the management, who had so far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested that the meeting should be "in the interest of sheltering".
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B on Tuesday, following the submission of a warning by Unsa and Independents.
The trade unions apply for a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 is variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line to the millions of daily travellers.
The RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, reach from EUR 2,200 to EUR 2,700 gross and EUR 600 to EUR 650 premiums, for hours off, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurde party, hard decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court pronounced on Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish party of the country, a decision that was immediately followed by anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is likely to complicate the Government's task, which has just reached the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "damaging of activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unit," the President of the Court of Justice, said in the press at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously of the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes were required to pronounce the dissolution, Mr. Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's officers, including President Ahmet Türk and MEP Aysel Tugluk, are political prisoners for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the rise in parliamentary immunity to which Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk were entitled and the confiscation by the Party's Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
Its leaders had preceded the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalczynkaya, who accused the DTP of obeying the “directives” of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it has no "organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the Court takes place while the government has just stretched its hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, in order to try to reduce Kurdes' support to the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leaders had stated that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in the South-East Anatolian, where many protests against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have been degenerating with the police these past weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators have gathered in front of DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the south-east populous majority of Kurdes.
The forces of the order drew lacrymogenic grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators launched molotov cocktails or stones, with springs.
A hundred people also showed up in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the Court's decision would "increase despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (kurd, dlr) by prohibiting a party, has it declared to the press.
The Government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
We are, in principle, opposed to the closure of the parties.
That doesn't work out, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpilation of the democratic opening launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can of course expect a response from the PKK to be added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the person responsible for the road derailment and sanding service (FES) makes it clear that it is not to deceive the citizens.
It's just so that agents can test vehicle technology and learn to control them well.
And according to the meteorologist, it could be good for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack snow and glass.
The ESF is following a very well-developed plan.
Mr. Brauburger explained that as soon as he turned his back on the city of Frankfurt and that the temperatures went down below zero, large sanding vehicles flowed through 20 main routes (called itineraries A) .
This includes streets with large circulation, main arteries, such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
It also includes firefighting, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and pedestrian streets such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES agents start their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 km of road must be salted with a road base that adheres well, within 3 hours of maximum time.
That's why the FES service starts at 3:00 a.m. "in order for the roads to be derailed when daily migration traffic begins".
There or it gets harder, it's when the snow falls at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, tells us responsible for the derailment and sanding service of the roads "because no motorists are willing to let the vehicles pass".
Then, if he no longer snows, we deal with access routes and desert routes - such as the Rat-Beil-Strasse.
The secondary roads and the lateral streets are finally coming.
Mr. Brauburger well knows that this has always caused some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES Pedestrian Team is on its way to prioritize hazardous areas and transit.
With regard to cyclable tracks, FES services are generally unable to deal with this.
Mr. Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the bridges between 22 and 430 hours.
As the glass forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salad vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
There is also a need for the police to use this special service.
The Dinosaurs' berth
The Hallae Tawa resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipedus measured about 2 meters long for 1.50 m high, its later members were powerful, its long skull was supplied with acreted and curved teeth, its short arms ended with facilital grips and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, like the Sertling Nesbit report from the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in the magazine Science of Thursday, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which made up the part of the land that emerged from the supercontinent, the Panghé and was to the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the bright Tawa of a new day the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
In fact, it teaches us about the relationship of parenthood, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt started searching for other palontologists, on Gohst Ranch's site in the north of New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Natural History Museum and a member of the search team tells them that he sometimes found a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The leaves of five specimens have been updated.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers baptized him in the name of Tawa according to the word of the Indians Hopi for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: the dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some incomplete bone fragments.
All paleontology experts do not share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery particularly spectacular, but he states that it confirms certain theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth some 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify all the first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, when the Saurians were divided into three major groups of evolution: thetropods (carnivores) that include the tyronosaur and the biker that later appeared and which descend the birds, the sauropods, the quadrupeds on the long coast, and those who are related to them and the herbivores of Ornithians, which are part of species such as triratops and stegosaur.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theorems.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found indications that the Tawa Hallae had small airbags in its bones at the skull level, as well as the birds that are the descendants of the therapists.
These small airbags facilitate the breathing of birds compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrates were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theorems with small air bags in its bones.
As the related line of immense sauropods also had airbags and a light ossage, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three subsequent migration waves to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known were living in South America, researchers concluded that the Sauritians were there.
As a result, the three major lines of evolution have been divided and distributed from South America to the rest of the world, that is to say all of the emerging lands that formed the Panghé supercontinent.
This appears to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists has also discovered the remains of two other theorists that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have disappeared, advancing the researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History of New York and co-author of the magazine Science Studies says there would have been at least three migration waves to North America.
There have been some contradictions.
Martin Sander, paleontologist at Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silhouette, who lived in the present Poland and belonged to a group of dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong vision because there are many dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while virtually none of them are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how did dinosaurs become the dominant tetrapods of the second century while they produced a relatively rare collateral line from the reptile branch, still a mystery remains today.
At the time of the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the present crocodiles and with many other sages.
Towards the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread across the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There could be a massive extinction in which dinosaurs survived by random means, while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted and could thus eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favorable meteorite to the expansion of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and which had been growing in the shadows since then: it was mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories all over the world.
There are teachers from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those in charge of courses at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Breme.
The evacuation by the casino police at the J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt makes waves all over the world.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North America and South America express their solidarity with the Protestant students of Campus Westend.
In a statement drawn up in German and English, he condemned the police intervention requested by the university's board of directors.
Last week, the President of the University of Werner Müller-Estler had evacuated the buildings occupied by the students and teachers after the wall and works of art had been barbed by graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
Signatories believe that the degradations did not justify "a violent intervention on the part of the police team against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
The evacuation is an "inadmissible attack" on freedom of research and education.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegate and criminalize the protest" and try to forget the reasons for mobilization.
The University Board of Directors thus withdrew from the discussions that would still be essential.
Course officers require immediate suspension of criminal proceedings.
The majority of the population did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimization of protests
The young members of the Green Trade Union of the Services sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity among students.
The protests are only the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional secretary of the Greens' youth.
With regard to the Minister of Science of the Country of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took action and made a cause for the action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of places is totally unacceptable, she told the regional Parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday during the current hour television show.
We understand the meaning of the protests, but we do not accept vandalism, the CDU member of the regional Parliament, Peter Beuth, said.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Gauche (the Left) did not share that view.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the La Gauche Party (Linke)
Instead of reflecting on the student’s arguments and claims, they are evacuated.
The La Gauche Party has submitted a motion to the Minister of the Interior to report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new Silicon Valley
For a long time it was the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place to search for the secret weapon, under strict surveillance.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants at 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important sites of production and research in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, the place of francfort sciences – with university institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
The representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a " close cooperation protocol" last Wednesday and Wednesday.
The signatories were the deputy mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 the representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and research companies.
There is the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnicals, the major Sitronics companies and Rossijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "Green City") takes its name from the wooden hills of which the research centres are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The scope of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be sufficiently high.
For its participants, this is nothing less than a "new heart of Europe".
S21, it is much more than the founding of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will fill the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg, in a chaos that is desperate for ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the spirit of the 1980s.
The highways, with roads that ended up in the city, had the reputation at the time of being the remnants of the 19th century transport technology that had effect from the brakes of modern rail traffic, as it had already taken a long time to move the locomotives from the back to the front.
Come on, stop short, go – that's what you have to do.
That's why the line-heads have to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a train crossing station, which is about halfway across the Trans-European Railway Magistral between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, where the slogan "the heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long been compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to get the station into the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, the main line stations no longer have any real entry and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with auto and pilot cars at both ends.
However, the realization of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new line from the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and community policies have led to this.
The railway company is part of the party because it is the taxpayer who makes the costs of the largest project of infrastructure of the federal republic and not the public company.
From a urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
There is a urban space that – if you believe in the graphics of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The transition station and the expansion of the section are designed for a traffic of people to whom it was attributed - and is typical of the 1980s - an enormous increase.
At the time there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening traffic in goods because rail transport is much more respectable than by road.
But the new track, with its tilts, does not fit the freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious about many other railway projects indirectly.
For example, six billion euros will be invested in the Souba project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade, this money will be missing for other points of joining and engorging in the network.
The list of the Department of Transport mentions 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built at a slow pace.
It would be really urgent to support the champion here in depth.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking shoe.
The route of the Rhine Valley is about to become the highlight of international trade, and it is at the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the judgment of the airport
In the regional Parliament of Wiesbaden, the Government of the Land referred to the possibility of appeal to the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economics Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine from a legal point of view the judgement rendered by the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the country should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the project to build the runway for the north-west landing at Frankfurt airport.
The permit to land for 17 planes between 23 and 5 a.m., as planned by the Government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air pollution.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to file a case against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticises this time and tries to pressure the representative of the Government to send him to the Federal Administrative Tribunal of Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel parliamentary group invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promises made before the elections, which included banning night flights. Otherwise, this will be regarded as a total failure to a given word.
It is extremely difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the Chief of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir by alluding to the Electoral slogan of the FDP "We have our promises."
Minister Dieter Posch rejects the accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel, who claims that the Government of the country is attempting to authorize the night flights, however, using "advocacy and robbery".
It takes time to conduct a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "fast first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition regarding the statements of its party on the prohibition of night flights is completely out of the question.
U.S. banks repay the aid granted
The large American banks, very affected by the crisis, are based on their relationship with the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully reimbursed the Treasury $45 billion (more than €30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The U.S. television channel CNBC reported on a report that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
The banking institutions thus seek to remove the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of the bonuses awarded to the managers and the higher-cost regulation.
The Bank of America launched an increase in equity by selling securities to investors who reported to it $19 billion in cash.
The rest of the sum comes from bank deposits that are well filled by the sale of several branches of other sectors.
On Wednesday last night, Kenneth Lewis, the Director General of the Bank of America, took the floor to thank the U.S. taxpayers: the injection of capital significantly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capacity by purchasing the Merrill Lynch Investment Bank to the strongest of the financial shock.
The Citigroup also intends to provide money on financial markets to free itself from State protection.
The U.S. bank could thus launch a 20 billion-dollar increase on Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain calling banking.
Citigroup spokesperson did not want to comment on this information.
In June, the Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated Election
Finally, everything happened even faster than planned.
Just two weeks after the removal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender from the ZDF German Chain Management Board, the successor is already appointed.
The Committee wished to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin-based edition of ZDF, was the great favor.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also a willingness not to harm the ZDF's predecessor Markus Schächter in case the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is the candidate for Schächter, needed the vote of 9 Commission members on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council were declared in favour of the resumption of Brender and 7 others had voted against. Brender's resignation by vote was a failure that was well-prepared for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is majority in the Board of Directors, had already been able to hear several weeks before the vote, did not want to repeat Brender to his position.
This is Roland Koch, the Prime Minister of the Country of Hesse, who had organized a fight against the editor in charge.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly estimated editor-in-chief by claiming that the hearing rate for ZDF information emissions had dropped under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, suffocating the growing political influence on the ZDF.
Finally, there were even 35 public law experts who had been involved in the debate and who believed that the way in which Koch acted was anti-constitutional.
But it won't serve anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political sciences, teaching and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the South Westfunk (Rhenania-Palatinate radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national quota).
In 1983 he became a editor in the ZDF first in the "day-to-day" news magazine (now's journal).
Then his journey continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the editor-in-chief of the time; then he was head of the "Morgenmagazines" (bimonthly information issue presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin drafting.
After Brender's disgrace, while he was just elected a journalist of the year by the Specialist magazine Medium Magazine, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's Adversary to the Board of Directors, the Prime Minister of the Rhine-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Lands should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the staff proposals of the respondent could not be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of the political personalities of the ZDF Monitoring Committees.
Peter Frey, the most likely successor of Brender, had worked hand in hand with the Board of Directors by criticizing the commission with vehemence in his decision to clear Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the editor-in-chief position without losing face, as well as the Board of Directors could deliver it without suspecting the position of a political party.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is liberal from the left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partly success for students: after one year of education strike, the Ministers for Education and Cultural Affairs of the Lands decided to become more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and delegates of the Governing Council, an agreement was reached that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to ease the weight of the examinations: a single examination should allow the selected study module to be closed.
Moreover, the workload will have to be reviewed to ensure "real and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also undertaken to organize more flexible common structural requirements for the branches of Bachelor and Master.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one country to another.
Fewer Exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June last year, the Minister of Education of the Netherlands and the university directors have consistently expressed the term "teachability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of examinations: "Each module must normally be completed by a single examination", one can read in a document of thirty pages on future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, states that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, derailments should be able to be stopped, which would have a significant impact on studyability.
"Studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background should be carefully examined to see if you can't avoid this feeling of exhaustion that you sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate fraud.
Students should "have the opportunity and margin of manoeuvre necessary to enable and promote the personal initiative".
The new regulation will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on the accreditation councils established by the Lands.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put pressure on the Lands to focus on agencies so that the programmes were not overloaded and the system of examinations was not too strict.
In some countries, universities and specialized universities have already been consulted with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
The Rhine-Palatinate has so far been the only country to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize programmes to strengthen educational guidance offices as well as examination offices and international relations services.
The Länder and universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million.
At the beginning of 2010, the Government wishes to submit to Parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act.
As a result, there will be only one study to close its studies.
The organization of studies will have to be more flexible, and there is a need to ensure recognition of the records of other higher education institutions and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all university cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and opposition again discussed the subject of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were made.
The Federal President of the Association of Socialist Students announced that he would like the organization of education policy to be no longer in the future "after the closed doors" of the Ministers and directors of universities.
Not later than the educational strike, students as individuals should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Rectors' Conference Delegates (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful to us," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education in the Netherlands with which HRK works on a joint reform project.
For the education and science union (GEW) decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. He claims the right and the possibility for each graduate bachelor to join a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder provide students with the Bachelor today, that there will be enough room for studies in Master and as good study conditions as possible.
The Netherlands must therefore employ more trainees.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of facilitating access to the Master.
More than one bottom note on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Comes to Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by poet Werner Söllner, in which he is the subject in brigades of disturbing phrases, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and subsequently head of the collection in a youth publishing house before he settled in Frankfurt on Main.
Söllner received several literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly coveted poetry chair at Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been the director of the Hesse literature forum at the Mousonturm's house in Frankfurt.
He talked a lot about him in non-literate circles last Tuesday, at a convention in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror deforming your security files".
Apparently destabilized and geniused, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged in front of his German-Roman colleagues such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer as an informer for the Security Policy.
Söllner received the German language price in 1989 together with some of the participants.
The rolling tests had begun in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner "so someone who has not been able to resist the temptation of security."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant of Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honour of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his exemplary literary movements with the mechanisms of the power of dictatorship, the literary scene is broken, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abisms and lowness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own security file, IM Walter played a role, assures the literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had intervened in his favor.
"He could have taken it out of all the difficult situations at the time," says Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, however, the dissident of an old dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for security spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Di Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have made speculations and sometimes become what real names were last hidden the names of Sorin, Voic and Walter loans.
Unlike Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the inheritance of the Security files is still very confused.
Systematic lighting has been uninterrupted and slowed down in recent years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council belonging to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the Security Archives (CNSAS) but the recovery of the files has been processed since.
There has been a law that defines the management of archives since 2005.
That the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still very large is confirmed by the interview of an elder responsible for the Security of Temesvar who, following the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expresses himself in three ways derogating from the award.
She had a psychosis, and eventually she was interrogated only once.
The infamy of power thought to be able to express itself here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many unelectable issues are associated with the Söllner case as this happens so often in a hidden guilt context.
Why now? Who has been robbed? The heavy response of the audiences, to the Having of Söllner, lets hope that the follow-up to this chapter will be defined more by a thirst to know than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genius of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote below.
Tumults at the Champions League
There was the impression that a representative was coming there, shot at four pings that came all right from a Christmas party, on which the sports articles manufacturer had cut off his goods when the new VFB Christian Gross coach mounted at midnight less the fourth in a Mercedes class C, which he just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier to his hand.
The man, whose skull would attract attention, lets himself drive to the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise, our five-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he didn't drink alcohol and he wasn't happy anymore.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the job had to be resumed.
Because now it's gonna start.
The words of Switzerland that had just been committed three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth end," that is, in the league of champions through our 3 :1 against Unirea Urziceni from Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal struggle not to fail."
The "great work" awaits us on Sunday.
There, this is to repeat to Mainz the results of the league of champions every day.
And the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three expeditional goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11) must be overcome.
Lot-of-the-series
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16/17. + 23/24 February/ match return 9./10. + 16/17. March) will be shot at Nyon on December 18.
Therefore, the joy of the entry into full function of the successor of Babbel was moderate.
And joy was not only moderated in the one who had been lucky, who had sent down destabilized Stuttgart professionals, an unbreakable motivation and pleasure to play.
I've been seeing the players and I told them that they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "plumbing of souls" – Gross – the recipe of success that sounded so good that it never had any more effects with the care of Babbel.
He triggered a certain magic, aka Jens Lehmann - partisan of Babbel - "in the foot when there is a new impulse there are sometimes things that one would never have believed possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of pause for injury, moves to the best player thanks to his dynamics, tries to describe the " phenomenon" found by a proviso "free wind" and the new leader's method of work: "It's someone who walks into action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But I guess Babbel missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the head yet, keeping the manager Horst Heldt safe.
For the time being, VfB Stuttgart needs tenacity.
Like Gross, players and managers are careful to overestimate the victory against a completely over-defence and weaken the Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow before having a bad wake four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 , objecta Kedira.
Horst Heltt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the objectives of the season, but that they had others who were still far away.
We haven't passed the difficult one yet.
That Heltt on his 40th anniversary didn't have the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home for three months, it was from the events of the weekend that a television interview by the target guard Jens Lehmann made a rebound just before the start of the match.
There are decisions others make and not Jens, would contradict Heldt, in response to Lehmann's bitter criticism.
He had accused the style weakness management and said she had decided to change coaches under the pressure of puberty fans.
Lehmann had also felt as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of freedom after the games had been removed.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by a pure selfishness" enfonça Heldt and announced consequences for the target guard.
They no longer risk becoming friends with these two quadrennials.
In any case, they agreed on the rest, namely that without the group's preliminary work by the substitute coach, the strong sport and combat representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a great deal of success" back in the heart of Heldt and Lehmann – and even the man in the plastic bag aquiesça.
Heavyweight World Championship
Warming hot in Bern: Kevin Johnson was causing the challenger to stop verbally and violently the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds, the Ukrainian defends its world's heavyweight champion title according to the WBC Federation's version.
In the unanimous opinion of the judges, the Court of Justice has been called upon.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko preserves its champion title from the world of heavy weights.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion won a victory at the point of the unmind of judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time, Klitschko has been honoring his title since his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, Ukraine had twice won the WBO and WBC World Championship.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed so much as expected KO.
Klitschko, a 39-time winner in 41 professional fights, has to admit twice his loss due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson has to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In Berne's Arene, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, from the height of its 2,02 meters, to the left.
Johnson, 11 centimeters younger who, before the duel, had announced the end of Klitschko era, succeeded in avoiding the champion's blows, thus preventing Klitschko from getting involved in its dangerous right.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, especially tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows only rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, has exceeded the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko's "vilian zombie" treating him who "is not really capable".
During Friday's weight, the champion couldn't stop himself from provoking Johnson by making him fall his sunglasses of the nose "to see his eyes".
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko again imposed himself in his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a pause of almost four years, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered the WBC belt he had previously left without fighting.
This year, defending his title as a champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Areola of the United States.
"I just took a break in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Vladimir is a WBO and IBF Federation champion.
But it is British David Haye who, having torn the great Nikolai Walujew - 2,13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko, which was due to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotion company is planning to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the Kunduz case.
The parties SPD and La Gauche (the Left) ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition appealed to the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) for deliberately dissipating certain facts.
The Minister deliberately "formulated a contraversity" on the murder of two tankers last September, said the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the broadcast of information from the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (The 20h Journal).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given to the total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is, in substance, the content of the NATO report, which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the goal of the trap was in reality, not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to NATO's investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured during the U.S. air raid that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Gauche asked the Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday, to speak as soon as possible before the federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Verts Renate Kunast party are of the view that Madame Angela Merkel must clearly state whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the federal government's Afghan policy if the Chancellor, Army and Information Services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesperson categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellery had no effect on the army's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were increasing to express doubts about the real reasons for the referral of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Department.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had sent to Guttenberg regarding the attack of tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have undermined the existence of NATO's report and hid some misleading details to the Minister.
However, the two senior officials were informed by the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a military police report.
"Frankfurter Allgemeineer Sontagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have requested in a mail a clarification of the facts.
Until now, he has not received an answer
On Saturday, the Ministry did not wish to comment on these allegations and referred to the Federal Parliament's commission of inquiry, which was to be held next Wednesday in order to bring the light on the facts in question.
The worlds of the dream
Some see images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
There is nothing but mental illness, or under the influence of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is very good.
When we are lying in our dreamy rooms, we can easily fall into the darkest dreams and ghosts.
However, the one who, wakes up, experiences the state of dreams, hears and sees things that the others do not perceive, has quicked the reputation in our Western world to be crazy or drugged, or to be at least an original.
Such images and voices appear only in patients with or under the influence of drugs.
It's our imagination that's in question: it's the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes stimulates the limits between dream, madness and reality to deepen.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can be presented in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect differ, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the Malays, psychosis and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when balance, neurotransmitter substances in the brain - first and foremost dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achethylcholine - breaks and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delirious thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The earthly attraction force no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great similarity between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud's dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that make it up".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a drawing band.
Its body is in two dimensions with the colors created.
The earthly attraction no longer has power over it, it plans at the dawn of the ceiling.
He's feeling a bit.
Behind him are the creatures of the devil winged, grinning, the breathless mouth, showing the teeth.
They pursue him, give him feet with heavy flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over the body.
Tonitrous, evil, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from its stereo channel, in fact a loop and attach it to a hook fixed to the ceiling.
He goes up on a buffle and passes the loop around the neck.
He's out.
The loop is falling apart.
What a lesson it is for you to learn, raise your voice in a heart to pull his tampan. "Go to a clinic and take care!"
Today Henning T. 40 years old, he lived six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was launched by the LSD.
The diagnosis: schizophrenia psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is maniaco-depressive, it takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
During my psychosis, I lived in terrible sorrows and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their schizophrenia life; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitement, which can cause them to suffer from hallucinations, megalamonia, relational fraud or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare anymore.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is drowned under the sensations.
Like dream, psychosis opens the doors to a tide of ideas and ghosts from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of the reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry of the CHU of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
Schizophrene is at the centre of the situation, all with a focus on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That's why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, wake up is excluded.
Make the experience once in your life of hallucinations.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
Degrading thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of life takes place in a real framework.
Why our brain makes this kind of cabrioles, it's always an enemy for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition in schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinant factors.
Researchers suggest that the individuals concerned have brain damage.
It is assumed that brain neuron maturation is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a mother's viral infection during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is how the anomaly of the neuronal system develops and overcoming the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a psychosis trigger, if there is predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain's hot.
What's crazy is, the professor of psychology Erich Kasten from Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of it while others buy expensive drugs to get away with it.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on illusory images and hallucinations for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Real World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are a large part of the common phenomena of psychosis, but also an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, plaque clerose, Alzheimer's disease or chronic trauma.
It is surprising to note that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They form when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently refractory; when our brain heats but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the lack of incentives, stress, grief of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, at least one third of the participants recognize that they have experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomeriane before and goes to high school.
A young girl's doing everything normal to be true.
If there were no images and voices.
During the recreation, a young boy, a thin, long-haired boy, sends the word to him.
When she answers her friends, she looks at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy young girl is a moonshine dreamer, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's certain of it.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy just as she sees and she hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence at the moment.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this nice young man.
I'm crazy, she's asking you sometimes.
But she well knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night, appearances are generally frustrating.
Often visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she is unable to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is obviously explaining equations to the table.
At night, appearances are generally frustrating.
When, in the dark of her room, she waits for the sleep that comes too rarely and too late, she often cannot make the distinction if she is awake or dreams already, if the images she sees, the grinning faces or the young girl with bloodproof details on her arms and legs are in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or her friends, they'd take it for a fool.
In autumn 2009, Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her bacc last year and she lived with her friend.
One year ago the hallucinations ceased.
Since she got in touch with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Folly is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough incentives, the probability is that he has hallucinations at the end of some time.
I suppose the brain is not busy enough, so there's an animation.
Sarah K., a single daughter, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was old to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience", according to Kasten "there is a place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, so they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia, a mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to treat hallucinations as a special talent.
There's only one step between dreaming and hallucination.
Unfortunately, in our world too focused on consciousness there is a quick tendency to take the imaginary experiences for pathologists, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor of Heidelberg and medical chief of the psychiatric clinic and psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but which also contains something positive, creative - the folie is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the form of experience called oneiroide, a particular form of the change of consciousness raised by the dream.
Oniroid vecus are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that it cannot be distinguished from the dream even when it is awake.
The state of the oniroid consciousness manifests itself during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathy that are fully aware of, the experience of a motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is separate from reality.
It is a state of mental limit between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, a capacity of organization that is given to us men, so that we do not wander in the face of loss of consciousness.
It's all real later in the memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Clasen, an art historian, also describes his uniroided experiences in his book "Compassion of the Heart" as a soul's saving action.
He is 49 years old, at a time when he is aware of a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain real in respiration.
Claussen dives into a world he created from all parts, visit foreign places, travel in time. He sees himself as an old man raised in a railway sanatorium, a robot with his hair watching over his health.
He lives in the middle of age among the noblemen who make blood-based drugs.
He is taken away by a Greek motorbike who takes him to his country, survives with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It absorbs completely in this imaginary world, everything is really even later in its memories.
According to Claussen, these internal journeys are fundamentally distinct from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes describing what he has lived.
On the contrary to dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even in the years to come.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and intense than real life.
The intensity of this life is causing the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, the oniroides, psychoses, hallucinations and psychological experiences show us how weak our internal representations of external reality are even in a watchful state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At 27 years of age, children will follow the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment to the Burda editions PDG post is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to re-enter the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, editor Hubert Burda sees his society between the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 years of age and are firmly determined to integrate the society, said Hubert Burda, 69, in Spiegel.
All the details have been dealt with in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will then arise.
You'll also need to see if they're capable of it.
It is not possible to impose its children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of it.
This would disturb children as well as the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he withdrew from the post of President-General from the post of President-General in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years old, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technology sector.
He then deals with the Treasury sector, that is, he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the lead in marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time, it's not a family member who's in the head of Burda's editions.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in the families that have been left to train through a capital bulimia, which have made enormous unfortunate speculations, thinking that they could grow ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
I've never dreamed of universal power, Burda said.
I absolutely do not see myself as the country's predecessor as Springer could be, and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues such as Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Full Beauty
Everything you can wish for, in terms of beauty and well-being, by hand.
This is the goal which has been set by El Corte English, which has just entered the Callao commercial centre (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, includes prestigious teaching such as Hedonai, a specialist in laser digging, Spaxion, with its rooms for relaxation and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Taci, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a sports room, or L'Occitine and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a diet radius, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different varieties.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while considering the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation zone to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and to relax thanks to a session of jacuzzi, massages while drinking a cup of champagne.
In total, it is 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy care.
For example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as "virtual trainers" that guide customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touchscreen, located in front of the device.
Several videos show us how to perform our exercise program correctly.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and extractions) are enough to make all the muscles of the body work.
And if after having made our body work, we want to go through the coffee shop, Luis & Taci has a room where we offer hair repair rituals, luminosity or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusion seem to have been the order words of this urban spa, which will be opened every day from 10 a.m. to 22 p.m.
Misc Decelerations
Noël approaches and it is never superfluous to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party dress.
The form of decolletation, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables we need to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated discount. This is not very recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Endesa electric company, in collaboration with Barcelona City Hall, created the "Live Office".
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and establish mobility agreements, taking action, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric Cities ”
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the deployment of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Séville are joining the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, within the framework of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the deployment of the electric car.
The Endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalonia.
It aims to promote technological research and development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that Endesa participates in with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in European-wide standardisation groups and has a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero interviewes "a future of peace" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, interviewed "a future of calm" for the Spanish automotive industry, which he recalled is the country's main export sector.
At the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Car Sector Competitiveness Plan, we would now have a abandonment landscape, closing some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain in a highly competitive sector, we can consider a peaceful future for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Full Plan for the Automobile Sector (PIA), has dedicated EUR 800 million to projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliaries, which have mobilised an investment of more than EUR 3 000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the Government's support measures to the request, in line with Plan 2000E, in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a “high increase” of registrations, which increased by “40 per cent” in November.
20.000 m2 of car collection
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Chamber of Car Collection, a meeting space for the professionals and the passions of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can you find motorcycles and car collection, but you can also find ClassicAuto Madrid articles of any kind related to the engine world.
Thus, in the exhibitors of the pavilion, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will bring happiness to collectors and curiouss.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among other things, Classicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restaurant, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restaurant, or Cochera Classicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Exterior aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this room will also include parallel activities: collections, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Ability tests with cars and motorcycles will also take place on a circuit built outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop : A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sports spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated on Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, baptized i-Stop, a device that is at least currently only available on the 2.0 engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it has obtained in its entirety.
Details, vehicle finish, habitat, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable about the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it appears that the front seats have an excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The steering wheel touch is also particularly pleasing to him.
By continuing with the overall set of controls and consoles, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and commands, as well as live colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sovereignty of German products, and especially with the Gulf of Volkswagen, which all want to overcome.
By continuing with the habitat, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitat to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, there is a large box of regular forms.
The engine's automatic stopping and starting system, at least for the moment, is only available on the engine with two litres and 150 horses and with manual change of the six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, its low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
In fact, although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not carry out a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-stop with essence engine, both for its great comfort of speed and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model selected for the test is the Sportive, in other words the one that presents the largest number of serial elements.
Among the serial equipment, the RVM, which removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed regulator, the photosensitive internal mirror, the edge computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the audio bluetooth, as well as the 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
In addition, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which includes, for 1,500 euros more, among other elements of the adaptable bi-xenon headlamps and an audio BOSE system with disc chargers.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not do many kilometres per year will be able to choose for the i-Stop version associated only with the engine with essence 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between €21,770 for the Luxury finish and €23,270 for the tested model, the Sportive.
In contrast to this important amount, Mazda3 will offer us a great dose of satisfaction every day.
"First" luxury
L.A. recovers the red tape of sensuality incarnate by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever blushed us, dressed in as elegant and sexy models for Nina's release. (Photos : Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had chosen for a dark "lady".
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to watch your e-mail, without offering the possibility to see some kind of attached parts or to navigate the Internet.
It enjoys its five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designates it as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see it in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, which is less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free living data service, for six times the price of Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He's as limited as his American grandfather, but it's a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those traveling with a smartphone already know what it means to give up the data when you cross a border or desperately looking for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a phone connection) to be able to consult your mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly seductive and it takes a long time for it to work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have made a physical thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated reminders of the European Commission to propose affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a very bad effect.
Outside of his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device such as FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon while it does not have Wifi) offers this type of tariff, meaning that operators start to think differently and study various proposals allowing them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
No subscription and no gallery.
It is a connected device and is paid at the time of its purchase, not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: an option to buy with access to life as Peek already offers it to the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my e-mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
The preferred colour of Michelle
The yellow is undoubtedly the preferred color of the first woman in the United States.
If she became the president of the United States, Barack Obama, with a dress and a coat of this color, she chose the same to accompany her at the second moment, no doubt, the most important thing in her life: the surrender to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling to the green with brilliant reflections, twice, the fabric consisted of three parts: clothing, clothing and clothing, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or necklace.
Although at first glance, it would seem that the first woman in the United States follows the silence of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to restore the same tenure.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If for the job it was a thick tooth, on the other hand, it carried a printed velvet to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium green shoes for the first time, and a similar model, but dormant, this time.
The hair has changed: the hair has now been recorded while it has been released the previous time.
75 per cent of working mothers have had occupational problems due to their motherhood
Labour discrimination has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what the study "Fecondity and professional career of women in Spain" carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9 737 women aged 15 to 75 does not leave any doubt as to whether 75 per cent of mothers who work have seen their limited professional careers due to maternity.
The study shows that there are many differences regarding the start of married life and the number of children, whether or not women work and the type of employment employed.
Those who do not have activity outside the home, work part-time or have little stable work, get together early, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, restate the entry into marriage and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed employment have their first child, on average, 3.7 years of age after being married. This figure goes to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. "These data show that women with stable employment need more time in their lives to get it, which has led them to abandon the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised greatly affects maternity, but less the date of the start of common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that increases the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training is, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who conducted elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years of age on average.
"Another discipline also appears among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have performed elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have conducted middle or higher studies invest in this program and give priority to getting a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger also worth it well
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
As of next year, the German actress will incarnate the image of several products of the brand, twisting the universal currency "Because I like it well".
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actors in the international scene, thus joins other celebrities recorded in L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if selected were the Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
In men, the cosmetic brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
His largest representatives, creators and monks, yesterday and today, met for the annual reimbursement of their prizes, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed you.
The former mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chose Best mannequin of the year.
Manuel Vincent's Aces Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poker de aces (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have spent their literary life (and sometimes their other life).
He does not do so according to the predictable and learned genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the character's ingenious core.
The trip is exciting and Vincent does not save the losers or the lighting.
Delightful, this book is also an exciting invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you here a few minutes.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical pulse, the same as I felt without a name: pleasure in the fundestine destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any gods."
On Samuel Beckett: “Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotentness and ignorance, with a poetic humour that blushed, in a sense, like the blade of the knife that killed him.”
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman by a passion that lasted thirty years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery with joy of sorrow, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven by the way of destruction."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which has to be recorded by the northern face, on which the best climbers are still and always taken."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange type.
For himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a county landowner and other times that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were of great size. ”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the demented cry from a bridge by this Munch character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he did it in the flight of himself and calling for posterioriity with a violent speech to the astics."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneels down and prays: "God is well-loved, I beg you to make me stop writing as a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were burned the verses of Spencer: "Silence after effort,/ after storm the port,/ rest after war,/ after life, fatigued the ravit death."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband generally agreed that she was told that Edward VII was the spy among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man as patient and loving as a neuroscientist whose literary talent exceeded the folly."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it is not to try to dissimulate Joyce at Baroja?
What if it's not to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did He do if it is not to abstinence the glory of this man so that he may serve him as a martyr?"
An Aggression Strikes
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed next to her and our dog, a blood-sweet, saved from the SPA and weighed no more than six pounds, and without a word, they took two blows of feet that left the dog severely injured.
Our anger is immense because we don't see what it's like to be assaulted free of charge by a little defenseless animal that was also left behind.
It must be added to this the indignity of a woman who walked quietly and who, when she ignored these individuals, became afraid of her physical integrity, because an energy that attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person less than him.
The episode took place at 5:00 a.m., one Tuesday like another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been playing all day.
We have heard a complaint from the district commissioner, even if we suspect that this is very important and not to touch the sensitivity, we just want to state that the murder was Spanish.
Indignity has led us to deny it.
We do not understand what is happening in young people so that they find it fun to abuse an animal free of charge that gives us affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the port of the helmet
The Michelin tire manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the port of the helmet, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as both structures today have indicated.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of the port of the helmet, since it is the only protection element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of an accident in two wheels.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which "go beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and stated that it contributed to this objective through other educational and informational actions.
This new campaign to encourage the port of the helmet in two wheels, under the currency "To be or not to be", will carry a first phase during which the posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since as a manufacturer of two-wheeled tyres, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles has progressed
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 per cent compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the master trade union of the Anfac and Ganvam manufacturers, the dealer.
However, the good news should be undermined, since the reference to the comparison, November 2008, was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebounding of the previous month, the accumulated registrations during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (cars of tourism, pick-up, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95 853 have been sold.
The major clouds that affect their demand are not so dissipated. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
In addition to the restrictions on the limitation of bank credits, other factors such as the increase in unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation need to be added.
In view of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, aid for the purchase of the 2000E has not been used.
In addition to individuals, independent and SMEs wishing to buy a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, they can also benefit from it, but the number of operations itself speaks of it.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, we reminded again of the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The Association of Dealers provides for a 2010 year similar to that for which it calculates a 19% decrease in sales (tourism vehicles and 4x4).
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As this has taken place with the ABS brake anti-lock system and as it will take place with the ESC stability control, emergency braking systems will be an essential element of European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered light commercial vehicles and tourism cars, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The European Union's objective is to strengthen pedestrian protection, even if, by its way of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant shall act by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the case of emergency detected by the system by the footing given by the driver.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of vehicle components Bosch, one third of the drivers involved in an accident could not support the brake before the collision, and half of them did not benefit from all its power.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in return, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that a crash on four with injured people would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, by means of a radar or camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver from acting on brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not respond, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors surrenders the plan for Opel until January
While Opel de Figueruelas (Saragosse) workers were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warned that he would need more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, believes that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
This may include the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, being postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, a decision on Saab's sale should be made in the next few days.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the Swedish government has put pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as quickly as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with potential new buyers.
One of them might be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the application of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian Converg group, is of importance.
In case there would be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
On the Porsche Boxster Spyder flight
To design their latest and precious jewelry, Porsche engineers left Boxster S and managed to lose nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance only 1 275 kilos.
This led them to move, first of all, from the automatic roof that was replaced by a hand-held roof, allowing to reduce 21 kilos, to use aluminium doors such as those of the GT3, 15 other kilos less, to remove the air-conditioning, 13 kilos, to reduce the core tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of gain, to mount sports tanks, another 12 kilos, and with light tyres of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, thus winning six other kilograms and replaced the pockets with tissue pockets, saving the remaining kilos.
Although the model also exists with the double-wrapped PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on the roads of the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
Its behaviour can only be irreproachable.
The weight decrease does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with ablomb.
On the contrary: it was a long time ago that we had not tested such a small and lightweight model that at the same time ensures so much safety in the turns, including at high speeds.
It's a little athlete, able to heat up his little muscle speed for the time needed, until we asked him to sprint, pause, recover and push his engine again...
That's what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as precise as it says, the car will do what our hands will tell us about the wheel.
And she'll do it with a surgical precision.
Voluntary engine sound
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the option "sport" or a system that changes engine roughness, already used on Panama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether in arrest or in recovery.
The suspensions are closed, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The roofing of the roads we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty low, but the car managed well with the chicken nests.
Electronic assistants are hardly present on the entire journey, while on some turns we found the mirror in the morning and the engravings later in the morning.
In the end, an ultra-light car, the most fun driving and that is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of EUR 70,831.

Basconia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a 91-82 triumph on its visit to the Maccabi Electra hardland, despite the many absences suffered by the Dusko Ivanovic team. It is thus at the head of its group, following Mirza Teletovic's great show, which, with eight three-point banners, was the best of its team (29 evaluations).
The Vitoria team has managed to complete the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a great deal of commitment and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill since the perimeter, with 16 panels with three points marked, largely determines the final victory.
The match began quickly for blue and red, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four panels of the Victoria team were marked from the perimeter made it appear that they had jumped on the Israeli field with the hot fists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but the Alava team chose the inner game of Barac and Elijahhu's work, which was received by acclamation and applause to his former home, to increase their benefit to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to notice himself as the best player of his team, with 13 points marked, although the "less than six" evaluation of Splitter already had to assume that this night was not the best of Brazil.
But in this match, despite being on the right track for the break, nothing was played, far away from there, and Avala's team wanted to remind Victoria that we don't get so easily on their ground, and thanks to "the hand of Elijah", they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, injured but far from being dead, needed to scrambling some skilled action to take the air, and it was at that time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, which, with three posters at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas, sent the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the premises managed to accentuate at the end of the third quarter-time (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play all the time during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they were not going to let anyone take what they had earned for the first 30 minutes.
However, Pinni y Eidson, the best of their team, did not sign up and try to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for errors, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defend well, and while the Israelis were getting closer in the last minute (80-85), the party was already playing and the victory escaped to Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Accidents prevent Unicja from delivering battle
Unicaja lost her voice in Greece in front of Olympiacos and gave her the head of Group B of the Euroligue, during a match marked by the absence of Unicaja players, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frustrated by the atmosphere of the flagship of Peace and Friendship or the vastness of the rival, no doubt one of Europe's most powerful and budgeted.
The game of the first quarter, made it possible to dream of the Andalusians. An aggressive defense and three posters at three consecutive points, two of the master Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who blew up the local team 12-18 at the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the internal game of Bourusis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse the score 22-20 at the 13th minute, when an action, a start to baccarat, between the North American teenagers Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to function by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit to hurt the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez weighed on Unicaja.
The internal players and the Lithuanian eagle Linas Kleizas, with their three-point banners, increased the advantage 44-32 at the nineteenth minute.
No mount possible
The third period was particularly offensive to Olympiacos, which, despite the 19 losses, was shown to be higher and even equal to the difference in the meeting held in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, causing the group's head to fail.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, three-point cooks, and Lewis support, left little hope with 66-57, at thirty-first minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible because Olympiacos would prove implacable when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to lift the score to 81-62 at the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submits, accepting the victory of Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application by Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The "How much should you be paid?" tool calculates the pay of users from more than 140,000 job offers available in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
Since a week of application, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker "is feeling poorly paid", explained in a communiqué the responsible for Trovit's products, Albert Ribera.
According to data provided by Trovità from its research engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45 226 euros per year and a French, 31,059, while a Spanish receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives EUR 34 247 per year in England, EUR 25 751 in France and EUR 16 420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid work in Spain is that of the server, with EUR 11,592 annual net, followed by the seller, with EUR 14,725, and that of the worker, with EUR 15,667.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet over the last three months are the driver, the medium-term job and the social worker.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a time limit for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy of Tegucigalpa.
The vice president will have to abandon diplomatic legislation by 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, a business manager of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed on TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been refugees since 21 September before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, following his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The chain also cited the former mandate officer, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the appointed deadline: "My position is as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya ensured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, as Zelaya refused the political exile condition that he understood to impose on him the government actually presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After days of roses since last spring, during which the inflation of the assets was the dominant market note, the uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising because it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise markets was to currency the debt through the direct acquisition of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at close zero rates so that financial institutions would buy assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have been practically completed and, without challenging their non-conformity liquidity policy, they start putting a little sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their award for one year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reverse reduction in risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and the deviations from business obligations are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached in the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize their private risk and public debt is again affected.
Once again, there is a return to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the investors' chosen shelters, causing an increase in the differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely touched by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened with a new revision to the decline in the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral risk, who tried again to raise a case of conscience among the world economic policy leaders who had stopped the destructive effects of limiting the credit for the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is a new day of action.
However, the situation in Dubai is similar to a tribal struggle between the Emirs to restore its place to power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that dissipates a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot to the roses.
I sold it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be totally irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area Member State to fail to meet its commitments.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens responsible for the need for special measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few too high positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our gap in public debt increases to the extent of the obligations of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European disparities were to decrease and our growth continued, then it would be a Spanish idiopathic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators require most of the study services to anticipate their recovery models and to review their forecasts upwards for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which are back in charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not open much hope for their warning.
Again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment "preciousness is a mother of soberness".
Connected Sectors
The President of Iberdola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday in front of the Congress's sub-committee of Members, which discussed Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades.
After his intervention, which was followed by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán made a search for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommission at eight o'clock.
For the President of Iberdola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million by 2020 and EUR 60 000 million more between that date and 2030, if nuclear power plants are to remain open today.
If not, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue changes, and power needs to be increased.
Its pari focuses on both gas and coal plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW are more needed, with other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what its company claims, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term balance" in that sense, despite the "point-to-point" measures, as the President of Iberdola has called them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, as they take some time before they reach maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Air Lingus maintenance market in ten airports
Swiss company Swissport, subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground airport services, will play the privileged role of Irish air carrier Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a period of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructure.
The alliance provides for an investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to carry out research on energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Actiona disputes its first highway in Australia in Hochtifti and Bouygues
Actiona fights for its first concession highway in Australia, a market on which it already works as an energy company and a water manager.
The construction site is an estimated $1,700 million Australian dollar tunnel (approximately $1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtift are its rivals.
A tunnel of 5 km long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Akiona to settle in the country as a public works company and a car dealer.
The mayor of the city wishes to be able to make it available for the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of the finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the salary.
In the expectation of the submission of their offers in May, the planned investment amounted to $1,700 million in Australia (about EUR 1,047 million) and in the last phase three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The Transcity Baptist group is run by Akiona, the only Spanish company in luxury, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European underground specialists.
Against the Actiona team, the Northern Direct consortium was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Lighton (the branch of the German manufacturer Hochtift, which has its turn of participation in the ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the galloise company specialized in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large buildings and privatizations, but entering it is a great challenge if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by Hochtiv and Bilfinger companies, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS is hardly able to acquire a place on this market by its 30% stake in Hochtift, owner of Leighton.
Monetary assets
It operates on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a wide presence through its energy supplier activity and in the de-salinisation sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and manages the group of companies responsible for erecting and managing Adelaide desalination, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to benefit from synergies to enter into the infrastructure construction and management markets.
The underground footpath, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the Northern Link (north link), is called to link Toowong's western highway to the peripheral road in Kelvin Grove (see map), 4 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The administrative timetable indicates that the award will take place during summer 2010 and that the work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this route will be opened at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the building will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will understand twice, an electronic charging system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) for funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtiv
Australia continues to make Hochtift widely fruitful, which mentioned yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will, through its local branch Lightton, equip the infrastructure of the high-voltage national network in optical fiber.
This intervention will allow 400 000 people to have rapid Internet access and provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company gave up the King George tour construction project on 27 floors in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet started and Hochtift completed the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically in Manchester, it will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is seeing to award a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine branch, is responsible for the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 km long for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having been responsible for the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel, Austria, for an amount of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the project is scheduled for early 2010 and its implementation will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore sees Renfe's advertising award
Renfe provided the advertising and marketing services of these two years to Mrs. Rushmore, for a budget of approximately three million euros a year, indicated the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen from 16 agencies that have submitted themselves to the Renfe call, four of which have been finalists, including TBWA, who has been responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A 63 million fine in France Telecom to stop competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million in France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region of the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephones by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and loyalty programs to consumers on the part of the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company, has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it puts on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has also been increased because the competition authority considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore reciprocated.
A store of applications
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile phone company’s branch followed the move of other operators and opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
At the start, the Orange application store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the League of Champions has reported 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The League of Champions has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona won 467,4 million, which puts them in the third and fifth positions of the clubs that put the most money in this competition.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Gaining the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income from major clubs.
In fact, the competition allocated EUR 5 362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament during the 1992-1993 season, according to the UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third of the continent to touch the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, has won the trophee three times.
The Catalan club, currently under the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is the fifth on the list.
The Manchester United and Bayern of Munich are listed in the list, the two teams that also billed the most money for their participation in the last League of Champions.
And that, although they lost in front of Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the League of Champions, although it has won more than any other title (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of the money applied by the UEFA.
For this year, Michel Platini's agency plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the League of Champions.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the ranking games (including the Madrid Athletic) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to EUR 550 00 for each match fought.
There is also a bonus in the event of victory (EUR 800,000) and equality (EUR 400,000 for each team). Those who arrive at the eighth end receive three million each, the eight teams that arrive at the fourth end receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will receive every 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça has invested 2.5 million to win the European Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, which are dedicated to 337,8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and it has four attractive places.
The previous year's champion will attract 40 per cent of the money, 30 per cent for the second, 20 per cent for the third and 10 per cent for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The New Rumasa Group listed yesterday the details of the offer of purchase of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for the whole of the securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per action, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1 % per year for this report.
Yesterday Sos' shares ended at EUR 1.85 ; the New Rumasa offer therefore assesses the company by 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the €1.50 price reflects Sos's actual assessment.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group gives a 15-day period for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
CNMV has not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos has claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If necessary, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos capital is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure his leadership.
In an attempt to stay out of any bids to buy and go and come judges of his former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as a director of internal audit.
A decision that the first woman to occupy a position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will directly depend on the group's president.
And it is not free of controversy, since the company remains in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
In addition, the possibility that in the coming months His revelation of new fund disbursements cannot be excluded.
Regarding the credit to Salazar, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) announced yesterday before the national hearing that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes the Paternina exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved yesterday the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paterina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were appropriate to the standards in force and that it considered the content of the explanatory sheet submitted as a result of the amendments made on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerned the acquisition of 550,008 shares from Federico Paterina at a price of EUR 7,65 per share, representing 8.95 % of the social capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to negotiations on Madrid and Bilbao's scholarships.
He further explained that 5 592 778 million shares were reallocated, and that they could not be transmitted in any way before the end of the offer, indicating that the price had been fixed by Federico Paterina, in accordance with the provisions of the existing standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a crash are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each sinister is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complex work.
To calculate the cost of repair between €20,000 and €30 000 by hand, including the parts and the work hand can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes.
For this reason, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Providers of services and solutions for the assessment of disasters and maintenance devote themselves to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then treating them and offering them to their clients in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Auditex, of the North American Group Solera, is the leader company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies in competition in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audetex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, although in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car gets out of the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard job, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and record its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image of each model you can click on on the different parts of a car of tourism is established.
If this is a model sold massively, the work can be done in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
In the case of a small car, this can take three or four months. Currently, Auditex has complete information of 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about Porsche, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini.
As far as vehicles are concerned, the figure exceeds 99 %.
In order to carry out the documentation and development work of databases, Auditex has eight centres across the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in certain brands.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (generally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Auditex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information enables these companies to give them different uses and to offer various products.
The most frequent application concerns repair and maintenance, but according to countries, there are also tools for the management of parts of the case or for the calculation of the veneal or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide to the value of the opportunity cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Auditex does not propose it in our country, but it does so in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Auditex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the pharaoh product being AudaPlus, the standard pain assessment solution for experts.
And there are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the pieces, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is EUR 5.75 for low-cost customers at least ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of experts, negotiates its price with Audetex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it comes out of the mounting chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass, and AudaSubbastas is an open server for the professional sector on the Internet that allows to be placed on declared vehicles.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, carry out geo-demographic analyses or know the current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand have gone to the garage for a bread or how many have suffered serious sins for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It commercialises, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions to the assessment of the damage, damage or damage.
The assessment GT Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its volume of business has increased by 20 per cent per year over the last three years, with a turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she began her process of internationalization, with the implantation of an office in Paris.

According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is achieved in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% of the remaining in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.

Since 2007, it is next to the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auctions of injured cars
Last October, the soloera group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The operation involves a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85 per cent of the capital of the company, which could expand next year to the remaining 15 per cent.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimate and sales service is addressed exclusively to sector professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cash registers and professional sellers that need to be registered before the start of operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages over 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4,000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car with the number of chassis removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not absorbed can be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex approaches.
Garage currency in four stages
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audetex company ensures that the user obtains a currency in just four steps: to identify the vehicle, to search for the spare part, to create a currency and to generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially in order to convince the older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 land, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and Internet connection are needed.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears then the required piece is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the working hand, the majority or the reductions, and then he can print the device to return it to the client.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include the estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which can be covered by a credit.
Currently, the Audatex company works for these images to be in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will, for example, allow them to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
