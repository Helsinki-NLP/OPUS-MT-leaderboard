Republican strategy to resist the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republic had justified their policy of combating electoral counterfeits.
At the Brennan Centre, however, they consider the latest myth, claiming that the cases of counterfeiting in the United States are less rare than those of a milling strike.
In addition, only 300 cases of electronic counterfeiting in the United States have been reported by Republican lawyers in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In this sense, such actions are partly discredited by the American system of democracy.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most governments have since 2009 adopted laws that complicate the registration or voting process.
This event was renewed after the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to the Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, 180 drafts were adopted for one year, limiting the right to vote in 41 states.
New electoral laws require the elector to provide a certificate of identity with a photograph and proof of American nationality.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of pre-trial voting, abolish the right to register the elector on the day of voluntary expression and withdraw the right to vote to citizens with jurisdiction.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state had forced voters to file a photo-certificate.
India became the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the law adopted in 2008 in India.
The Republican authorities have speeded up the dissemination of this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated draft laws which oblige voters to issue identity certificates with a photograph in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity as a medical insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, that is, 21 million people who have reached the age of voting, do not have a certificate of identity with a photograph issued by the government body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
However, the value of obtaining the required identity certificate is often more than a hundred dollars.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of those who earn less than $35,000, 18 per cent of the population aged 65 and 20 per cent of the voter from 18 to 29 years do not have the required identity with the photograph.
But that's not all.
Students - voters who are considered to be voting for democratic candidates, in a number of states, are not allowed to use the identity of the person with the photograph issued by their educational institution.
The same states therefore allow members of fishing and hunting clubs who vote primarily for the Republic to use the certificates issued by these clubs to vote.
By 2004, no state had required evidence of American nationality to vote.
For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the vote of the people from Latin America.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are expected to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, the Republican legislators initiated legislation in 2011, which abolished the voter registration on the day of the vote in eight states.
They have also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This restriction was not without effect.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the electoral registration campaign helped to list some 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a 17 per cent decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
Thus, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters voting in advance were African Americans, although only 13 per cent of the total number of state voters were present.
The same has happened with Latin Americans.
Only 11 per cent of the voters represented 24 per cent of the people who voted in advance.
Unlike whites, which accounted for 76 per cent of the voters, only 46 per cent of the voters voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were welcomed by democratic governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended through the intervention of the United States Prosecutor General.
This allowed for a partial limitation of the negative effects.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have adopted laws requiring the identification of the person with the photograph.
However, the new rules in force would, of course, make it difficult to exercise the right of election at the 2012 elections.
Critics from Democrats condemn the prejudice of the laws that were adopted, with a clear focus on affecting the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
The report of the Brennan Centre since 2011 shows that the States that have adopted these laws are 171 out of 270 votes required in the electoral college to win the presidential elections.
It was too early to confirm with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral system would have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In this sense, such actions are partly discredited by the American system of democracy.
Screening the hand of the available iron: pass the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes produces erroneous results, false and sometimes false, which lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctantly dissident, have even more doubts.
Is the test going on or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
Studies conducted in the United States have seen numerous cases of infection among the study groups, so it is difficult to interpret and make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a different level of mortality among the patients who had been hiding and those who had not passed it.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the incidence of metastases was 30-40 per cent higher than that of those who did not pass the screening.
Therefore, I would recommend that a test be carried out at 50 years of age or at 40 if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African descent are also at high risk.
The key point is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and powerful.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer by offering possible options without compulsory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a long-term risk to life, and by making the choice, in these cases, for the benefit of active monitoring of the disease.
To this day, many men with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts to progress, we will start treatment.
We are increasingly setting criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment.
I would therefore recommend that the test be carried out.
But it is also important to consult your doctor in order to determine whether this test is necessary or not.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Mowember has established a tool to assess all for and against the passing of the PSA test.

Preventing Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in scientific research, compliance with a healthy life - style remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people were well fed and moved enough, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one was smoking anymore, this figure would increase to at least 50%," stressed Andre Bolie, the Canadian Cancer Association Press Secretary.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases are caused by inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain unexplained.
For the Canadian Association, smoking cancer remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85% of cases of mild cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It's a huge harm to people's health.
"Even today there are 1.5 million chickens in Quebec," says Press Secretary Andre Bolie.
The encouraging fact is that 10 years after smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Wes
According to CAR data, excess weight and obesity also contribute to the occurrence of disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat and direct faeces, food, iron and mats.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against the cancer of the thick tissue," they add to the Association.
Question
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of the cancer of a heavy cough.
Cobalt products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by cutting, drying or planting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to cancer," explains the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
However, the results of these studies cannot now be called definitive.
According to SCC, vitamin E studies produce conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of developing prostate cancer, the other led to a counterproductive outcome.
The impact on the development of vitamin D cancer is also not fully clear.
However, Mr. Bolio stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with a doctor.
"Adequate analysis doesn't lead to cancer."
Bozon Higgs in detail
Last summer's report that scientists may have been able to find Higgs boson, caused this journey - and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
In addition, it is the last particle that has been predicted in the Standard Model - our best, or, in any case, the "minimum imperfect" description of nature and the behavior of matter - but which has not been able to detect in advance.
But physics isn't even sure it's about Higgs.
We know that there is no doubt that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it is very fond of the Higgs boson, as predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, although some data are not yet fully reliable.
Let's imagine what it's about on Higgs, because the chances of making mistakes seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, a law that is completely inevitable, that two things cannot happen in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to embrace this rule, even try not to be too stubborn, or hurt yourself.
But although the physics of the elemental particles is a rather strange world, it also appears that there is a law of a similar nature: the principle of the exception of Paul, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same “quantum state” it is the “state” that is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
As a result, physics divides particles into two categories.
In one corner, we are well-informed citizens called farmers who are well-informed under Pauli's principle.
In contrast, the bozos, the angry band of anarchists who have no respect for anything, at least for this principle, mean that they can be at the same place at the same time.
As reported by the site (parts, completely unusual) Part Adventure Laboratory Berkeley, these bozones are divided, in turn, into two groups: mezones that we are not talking about here and the "parts of force" through which the main forces of nature are disseminated and which some kind of bozone Higgs is associated with.
These bozones should be stressed, not all such exotic substances as you might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it's because of one incredibly banal boson: photon, or "part of light", which is the "currier" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "breaks" the electromagnetic field in that particular place, like a stone thrown in the dust.
This “infraction” produces an electromagnetic wave (world, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photonomial, and thus one of the bosons of “power transferors”.
A More Stable Field
The same is true with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that, in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be broken.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable in the electromagnetic field; in order to stimulate it, it needs to achieve very and very high energy, as if it were a frozen rod, whose surface could only be crushed by a very large stone.
That's why we need a huge particle acceleration, like the one that's operating in the CERN, the Great Adronite Collider, which is a 27 km diameter ring, to achieve such enormous energies.
Analog with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, and others do not: a paper sheet, for example, will never be held on the refrigerator itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (such as photon, etc.) do not have it.
So, what can you do about all this research, Mrs. Plamondon?
They are used in science to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also enables physicists to learn the difference between the results of observations and the projections of the SM.
In addition, some of them are eager to find such a gap, so smaller disagreements can open the door to "new physics" and shut some of the doors of the Model.
The last thing to say is that there are still significant deficiencies without any explanation for gravity (o!) or for dark matter, which accounts for about 80% of the universe (o-o!).
But until the CERN found such differences.
Consequences
It would be a mistake to assume that it is not possible to predict the benefits of these studies for the average human life.
See: In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in Bell's laboratories could not even imagine what a revolution would call for their work.
They predicted their applications in science, but not more.
In fact, a late physicist, Willard Boyle, who worked at the Bell Laboratories, where a laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (previously pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was originally considered a "laboratory gadget".
Imagine...
In addition, the annex can be found for the accompanying study tool.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his optical studies.
This sensor, although it was not its original purpose, now serves as an eye for all digital cameras of the world and earned the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
This, of course, doesn't mean that the work of the Greater Adron Collaire will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative assistance is the best way to die... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Commission recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life in Quebec for worthy death.
The debate must be resumed soon and the bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
Long tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. Another man lived in his apartment in Monterey.
Prosthetic cancer, which destroyed him from within, gave him a two-year delay.
"I've been five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the shelter of Victor Gadbua's palliative care in Belyo, where he arrived.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for it," he says.
The disease is doing its job: an incredible weakness that does not allow itself to walk into the toilet and even eat alone.
Sitting at the dining table, he gives up and agrees to help him eat.
He dares even laugh, talks to strangers who work around him, bring him drugs, take him to the bathroom.
The courage before the usual death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"We are taught during life that a man should wash his feet," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadbua's reception.
Regress to the status of the child - for some unbearable humiliation.
"All depends on man's ability" to settle down with the legacy, he claims.
As many people in palliative care believe, important events are also taking place at the very heart of this decline.
Patients who go to Victor Gadbua's palliative shelter are all cancer patients.
Forecasts lead to a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the medical team and nurses are no longer providing any assistance called "medicine".
Ms. A., 89 years old, is the most afraid of dying "in the consciousness of the ghost."
But that's why the disease made me know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything more in life," she says before letting her put on a breathing mask.
She is still awaiting her son's last visit from Italy in the coming days.
In the host, Victor Gadboua, with the help of a group of volunteers, provides body care and food assistance.
This is a palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care facilities.
It's very small, given that sooner or later we're all gonna die.
This life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Kristian Martel, one of the host doctors.
Be comfortable physically, emotionally, or mentally.
We agree with the dying one to give the oral cracks from a brandy or pepsy, since he will ask for it.
Diabetes, we no longer have to control the level of sugar.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Last night we brought Mr. H.'s beer, which died tonight.
In the morning, his son got this beer in his leg and fell asleep.
"We help people as close as patients," says Natalie Savar, director of care for the sick.
In Victor Gadbu's reception, it's not like the previous day.
A number of 93-year-olds who enjoy their last meeting with their family in the yard, sitting on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically die a young man 36 years old, surrounded by parents, wife and two small children, and trying everything to survive.
"In the last half of the year, between three and five chickens are always treated with cancer at the age of 45," Dr. Kristian Martel said.
53 per cent of patients admitted to Victor Gadbua's hospital are from the house and 47 per cent from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have reached the final stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the hospital.
And some institutions, such as Victor Gadbua and the Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in care for cancer patients.
It is this great breakthrough in Quebec's health system that has caused many doctors who are experienced in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law that legalizes euthanasia and helps in suicide.
As early as October, the manifest signed by the palliative care lights, Dr. Balforom Mount and Dr. Bernard Leapunant, and demonstrating their disagreement with such an initiative, has been circulating.
According to Dr. Kristian Martel, the health system in Quebec is not effective enough to ensure the right to palliative treatment of high quality before a transition to euthanasia is permitted.
Recently, she said, "I've seen a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to relieve them.
I'm afraid patients only want to die because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have tried to save patients until the last day, despite the pessimistic predictions.
The hopes for survival of Ellen Richard were already minimal when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was stopping the fight, she told me.
At that time, she told me that my days were considered!
There's no universal care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask for death thank the hospital for not complying with their request after the palliative care team eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely effective in the fight against pain.
Elsi Monroe, director of palliative care in the Palliative Care Society, said that patients were not susceptible to recovery in 8 per cent of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often go to a palliative session, where the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time, or at all times.
It is no longer possible to pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
More and more sick people who cannot ease their pain will be able to have access to the palliative session.
The sick people who suffer from pain always say the same phrase, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want to have an euthanasia," that means "I want to make it easier for me."
The creation of this report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Institute of Health Studies in Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, fund collectors of political parties and Italian mafia specialists tell of what they know about the enormous "system" that is driving the construction industry, public servants, politicians, trade union actors and mafias.
Industry, which was very expensive for Quebec's taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's funny how this system breaks out after all the funds have been released, Jack Duiheno, the deputy and former chief of the Montreal police."
It was the result of the scandal in 2011 that led to the investigation of official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, which the prime minister of that time from the Liberals, Jean-Share, agreed very unwelcomely.
The report of Düšeno has established a direct link between industry, the secret financing of political parties and corruption.
“From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stressed that only the Ministry of Transport would retain a billion dollars in contracts”, if some had prevented their instincts from taking part.
The Sharbonno Commission “has already set up two mayors”, he adds, hoping that it will be able to “close up the schemes that exist behind individual personalities”.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case was linked to the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011, which consisted of a large state of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the staff of the Special Unit Molt, who had made Montreal's "Steel Card" after 2009, cease to increase the value of contracts.
During the last few weeks, a series of searches had been carried out, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Markotte, the mayor of a small town, had been accused of fraud and corruption.
In turn, Gil Wayangur, recently retired from the post of Mayor Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He was suspected of being charged on a number of occasions when public orders were placed.
In addition, the official charge was filed by several communication engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akurso and Lino Zambito.
The last bomb was shot by a "system" investigation into the procurement of public contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contracts entered into in Montreal to a Mafia broker who in turn transferred the money to the Mayor Gerald Tromble's "United Montreal" party.
In the 2000s, Zambito had laundered money to the right and the left, listing more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about EUR 68,000) for different provincial parties, mostly liberals who were then in power.
He also recognized that he had illegally collected funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party of Natalie Normando.
Formalization contracts in which value has been increased
The "system" of corruption in Montreal worked unimpactly.
Gil Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewerage contracts whose value he had increased.
Other road construction officials recognized that they had received a 30-40 per cent increase in the bill with false supplements.
Then an organizer from the mayor's party, Martin Dummon, accused Mr. Tramble that he intended to close his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party's cash registers.
After these discoveries, Mr. Tramble retired early in November, loading Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal to have killed the alarm.
The River-de-Prery district in the east of the island, it has been opposed to the sale of a municipal plot purchased for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million for the construction site.
70 per cent of gross money in pre-election campaigns
She said that in the investigation, which would eventually be initiated, she would “sit down a thread that would understand the functioning of a system that was squeaking with ants to stop the gangrene and identify the perpetrators”.
This process is described as “sick but positive”.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we're going home.
Regular.
Jacques Dušeno notes, on his part, that “the perpetrators have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars”, but he is particularly concerned about the role of “election officials who know about this scheme” but who are not involved in machinations.
Considering that the share of dirty money in the funding of the electoral campaign in Quebec is 70 per cent, he jokes, "I was told that it was just a bright reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit to $100 donations to parties, but it does not say that this will change the situation: "Until we strictly limit the election costs, there will be no money in politics."
He called for a full restructuring of the public contract system and the financing of the parties: "We can't go down below; we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy."
If this story leaves a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dušeno calls on those who laugh to look into their own yard...
"PZ - not FK Barcelona!"
In this season, you have achieved an unusual range in the GSP.
How would you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but may also be by a new measurement of the GSP.
Big games have come.
I grow up with them every day.
Technical personnel have also made a lot of contributions.
These factors make me raise my game level every day.
And at the time of the match, it's simple.
It's going very fast in football.
But I don't burn.
From the very beginning at the pre-training centre in Klerfonten and before I arrived in St. Etien, I was always walking ahead.
So you're taking advantage of the competition established by Carlo Ancellotti...
The filling of this summer is not in the news to play a very high-level match.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to such a game as I want to be at the level and to be taught as much as possible.
Also, Carlo Ancelotti is supporting my position.
He's been assisted by a deputy like Claude Mackele, who played in the same position as me.
Ankeloti is the owner of the situation?
Of course.
Ancholates bring respect to all technical personnel.
Today in the First League, he is not equal and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He had extensive experience, and he won many high-class titles.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
I had a encouraging conversation with him in January.
Then I left the whole series of traumas.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In the First League, Lion took the lead in us.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have been effectively qualified in one eighth final.
What's the goal of the club in this tournament?
We're trying to go as far as we can.
It's all possible now.
We can say our word to the person with very good European teams.
We first wanted to end the first in our group, in front of Porto, to have the opportunity to take a response match in one eighth final.
Can the GSP become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for that...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and maintain long-term positions.
It's not like that today.
The GSP has financial resources to make this project real.
Not taking the title in the First League, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to get this championship title.
Last season, we were close.
In May, there was disappointment because we had everything to get to the finish line first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points are called the champion.
But the other team, Monpele, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that the title struggle has entered such powerful teams as Marcel, Leon and Bordo, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media are waiting too much for the GSP?
It's normal for us to expect a lot, given how much we've been invested and what games we have.
We're all ready for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Trua at home, and we still find something to criticize, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what people are looking for first.
We're never gonna be able to win every one of the 4-0 exits.
We're not the Barcelona FC!
We're trying to implement the game project.
The command is formed in time.
We have proved in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which has not been able to spend two seasons in one eighth final, although they have also spent a lot of money!
In view of the amounts invested, we have represented you at 15 points ahead of the winter break.
This would be a disregard for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lion and Marcel, who were not high in the past season, were "exploited" by these new GSPs.
This shows how interesting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The GSP seems to depend entirely on the pursuit of the Golden Abrahamic Way.
Well, what if they say there's some "Golden Dependency"?
It just means that Ibrahimic is very successful and that he's killing a lot of heads.
He's here to prove that he's the star of the First League.
Where he was playing, he showed that he was a great player and a world-wide star.
In the group, we respect him as a man and a toy.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he did is really exclusive.
It also stimulates others to improve their game.
He is one of the best defenders in the world and also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 with the French assembly?
It's a disappointment.
I really wanted to study in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from wasting some time in the game.
I've seen a lot of things out there, and I'm getting stronger out of there.
Today I'm gonna be able to play good fights.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized in the Blues.
We learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now they have to be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didie Desham in the head of the Blues?
They're good for him.
He's got a good position in the defense team at the world championship.
He's a strict coach, he's close to the players and inspires victory.
What Lauren Blanc looked like.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc reached his goal, he qualified us in the Euro.
I hope Didie Dasham will bring the Blues to Brazil.
Good night (1-1), which was issued in Spain on 16 October, is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in itself.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, my career had no such match.
Pay and sell without bank help - with Bitcoin
The full contrast to the current cash exchange based on central banks, the number of transactions between the receiving parties and the commissioning fees for their processing.
In addition, as is often the case with these technologies, a political vision is evident: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is also a virtual currency (but converted into dollar, euro...) and a protected bittorrent exchange protocol that allows for the exchange of files between participants at one level.
About 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers in the network.
A number of thousands of sites have been accepted for the execution of donations or as a means of payment.
The Bithkina Course, reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (EUR 23) in June 2011, fell to $2 a month later before returning to about ten dollars today (the courses are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in this system in its report on the virtual currency published in October.
He describes the battle as "the most successful virtual currency", "competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like the usual currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as "credit" used to promote video games that are earned in the game process or that can be purchased (and sometimes exchange).
The Facebook social network has also developed a similar system.
But the exchange operations always control and process a central body.
In Bitken, all networks are simultaneously accountants, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mails, like an e-mail.
Only for each new payment the user can choose another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The collection of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically using a two-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is possible to verify that the battles used in the transaction actually exist in a public account book sent throughout the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It passes through a mathematical task sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, is privileged to add this new line.
This is a phase of file browsing, that is to convert a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add the number before "hashing" it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (very zero at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, other angles are easy to verify that it is correct.
The transaction is thus carried out in a non-participatingly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the sake of fraud, the user would want to pay twice the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures.
A computer that solves the problem gets 50 beats.
In order to avoid inflation, the prize will be divided regularly by half by the end of 2012.
Therefore, the number of bats is limited to 21 million, but they are divided into one million, leaving still a reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with an increase in computing capacity.
The lives of the network have already been affected by flooding and falling.
Bitcoin service sites have been attacked, and battles have been stolen from reserves.
"The defect used does not relate to the protocol itself," said Pierre Nouaz, who recently launched Paymium, a real-life payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But money is also lacking.
Major games, such as Wikipedia, are refusing to make such donations.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, are allowed to do so.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Watchman Institute in Israel analyzed the book and found that almost 80 per cent of the battles were not on the move.
The giant sales were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," Ion Holmkvist, who works in Coinabul, who is engaged in the conversion of biticons into gold.
Pierre Nouaz, another author of this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in this money) or a wireless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is cheap.
The owner better controls his personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Just to report the address that can be photographed and identified by the phone, Pierre Nouaz explains, confirming that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend towards a more horizontal revision of hierarchical systems.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 may become a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB intends, in fact, to review the various risks that are now considered to be high, in the case of the success of the system.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capis and Surabi).
NATO and Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not just us.
We have suffered mainly from the Afghan Crescents, which we considered to be terrorists.
And we're alone, with 88 soldiers killed, and wounded and dragged.
The Taliban is one of the foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of the Christians who reject the presence of the foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, and even join the Georgians, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbek, Tajik.
They're patient, sometimes they're helping local rebels, but they're not going to be as close as the West is going to be.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the heights of trees planted by the mindal trees through the French credits, was fine.
The convoys of trucks and helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban invasion in Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their insurmountable progress from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the fight between different groups.
They were then taken under the control of the country as their kind of release, return to security.
Afghan women have been paid for the neglect of these peasants, in which Al-Qaida has overcome them, but their situation has not improved in our days.
The former Mojaheids, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in subjection.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become parties to State-owned lands in order to resold them to return to return from Iran and Pakistan by using huge US subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them, in fact, were not fighting themselves.
People, as I heard in the rural area, want a government that would be free of thieves.
Many young people want to leave as those who have taken up the U.S. generosity: capital flow is significant.
Young people have stopped the war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during the exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population are under 25 years of age; in Kabul there are now 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the population.
State schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return to the dark of the old parties or to corrupt some leaders.
All, including armed fighters, love mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and that look everywhere.
There's an army right now.
The authorities that will command it, will they be considered legitimate?
The old anti-Soviet commanders have already taken steps to restore provincial women who would not be subject to the central authority.
Afghanistan, with strong local differences, must be decentralized to some extent, in the form of Western countries, but the United States wished to turn it into a centralized State with a strong presidential authority, removing the Prime Minister's post that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the April 2014 elections.
But his country, starting in the 1950s, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid.
Industry has not been put on foot, nor does any platinum work, nor has any irrigation system been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is done except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by the Thirty Years of War, State control of infrastructure would be necessary.
They heard that Afghanistan had enormous mineral wealth.
This only strengthened the feeling that the Western countries were present only to take possession of them.
No energy for the processing of iron or copper on the ground, no means of transport to export them through the mountains, there are no useful excavations.
The Chinese have almost left the location of Mess Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers of the province.
It is also necessary that, on a beautiful day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The French military units were completed on 20 November.
The new Treaty on Cooperation provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a person for girls, boys, a French language faculty at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to “fear hearts and minds” and to achieve the impossible task of complicating aid with offensive operations, the military-citizens service with the Ministry of Defence (Chimic), which was abolished in 2012, along with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public work and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These efforts, with the intensive involvement of the local workforce, have been able to help keep up the rise: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, soil protection, and the increase of farmland.
What do we keep in mind when we spend two billion euros on military expenditures?
Much more modest budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very severe in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for the implementation of small agricultural works originating from local communities in the province of Capri.
In order to get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, which farmers wanted, as they told me, they had to provide small non-military support that would be well controlled and directed towards them.
Weighty Generations of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky move by President Muhammad Morris.
While Egypt was divided more than ever on the issue of a constitutional declaration, which temporarily gave it extraordinary powers, it decided to play a va-bank.
As a result, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text for the next day.
One week ago, the Head of State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete the work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been based on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative only strengthened the country ' s division.
In the view of his opponents, the President insists on his “automatic bridge”, continuing to “break this word” and “supporting the right”.
The camp of its followers is convinced that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time when the Brothers refused to explain the text to the Egyptians, article after article.
For the President, this is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction is rampant throughout the country.
Muhammad Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians are voting positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
The more the call for an accelerated vote goes to the ultimate of the Egyptian people: " Either you vote for my text, or I leave the extraordinary powers," which are supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constitutional Assembly, most of the Islamics, voted for the text yesterday.
Most liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to bring their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the required quorum, 11 people with spare parts were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that, in most cases, the articles have been voted unanimously.
The commentators, in fact, have made fun of the fact that one of the few differences of day occurred around... the time for prayer, as some members of the Committee felt that the time of the Constituent Assembly was wrong.
The text on which the vote was taken yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, article 2 eventually remained an identical article of the 1971 Constitution, which called for the "principles of Sharia to be the main source of law".
The Salafiist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is a fundamental requirement, hoped to replace the “principles” with “rules”, which would enable them to be more rigorously applied.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is evidence of their good will and respect for other participants in Egyptian society.
"Licemerie," they answer the liberals who only see a pirate in it.
Because they believe that Islamization of the Constitution is taking place through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of the Shiriat.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pomye, it is alarming, that is, “people who are meant to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can observe the birth of theocracy."
Many Liberals are also encouraged by the fact that the next Rector of this university appears to be less moderate than the present one.
"Now there is no specific religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain under civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text were not victims, but people with university education, some of whom were trained in the French system," Alexis Bloe, who prepared a dissertation on Egypt's constitutional transition.
However, he acknowledged that “the scope of article 220 could be inconsistency, since the terms used in it were borrowed from religious lexicia.
This refers, in particular, to the 'fix' [Islamic jurisdiction, e.g. order.].
And in the future, there may be a question of how many civil judges are competent to make decisions about this."
In addition to its religious dimension, the text adopted yesterday was criticised as it gave wide authority to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers claim that they have significantly decreased compared to the old regime.
Another controversial moment: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military's wishes, the defence budget will be considered, not in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
Nor will the courts be prohibited against civilians in military courts, despite the requests of associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered to be harmful to freedom.
The responsibility for blasphemy has been maintained, and there is now a ban on insulting, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Moreover, none of the articles mention the protection of women, notes Heba Moraef, from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak yesterday evening on television, the demonstrations were scheduled for the second half of the day.
The Heads of State will, in turn, go out to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Pope Land and the sea from the desert
The Promised Land unites itself with the grandeur of Bible truth, modern comfort, and the superiority of nature.
The AIF has given five of the most important reasons to be found in Israel.
Worship at Sacred Places
The Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized, is worthy of attention.
It is thought that all those who enter this “buy, ” the grace of God, will disappear.
And Galilee was a place of miracles, and of Jesus, turning the wedding of water into wine, and of watering, and of storms, and of nets.
Jesus came here before his disciples and after his resurrection.
But the most sacred place in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here are on the Path of Grieving or the Crossway of Jesus (in Latin - Via Doloroz).
It begins in the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria, where there was a court, and on the streets of the Old City, it leads to the Temple of the Lord on Mount Golgotha, to the place of Rising, the Stone of the anointed, and the place of Jesus' burial.
Here, however, is the symbolic Christian pope of the earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will rise to a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree from which the cross was made for Jesus ’ burial was planted.
There is also the most sacred place in Jerusalem for the Jews, the Stone of Plac, left from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different faiths are left here with notes of wishes that are then fulfilled.
Make a vertical trip
The ruins of Massada’s fortress remained a secret refuge from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on the cliffs in the mountains at a height of 450 m above the ocean level.
And only those who are attracted to alpineism can reach their path.
The rest of this historic peak is delivered by the canathon.
And in the north of the country at 1600-2040 m there is a famous Hermon mountain resort, where in the winter months there is a huge wave of tourists.
He's got a bus shuttle on the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the mountain crossings is 45 km.
Ancient tradition suggests that the gods of the language lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You don't go all the way in for a trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located not far from Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or the Dead Sea Scrolls found in the caves of the Jewish Desert, and some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's worth a visit to the Museum of Arts in Tel Aviv.
Its exhibitions feature a wide range of impressionists and expressionsists of Mona, Pissarro, Renoara, Sezanna, Sisley, Matissa, Modiliani, Shagala, Picasso.
Akko can be found in the Al Bash Museum, which represents several halls of ancient Turkish baths with a crowd of visitors and children of that time.
In Caesarea, you must enter the unique part of the Rally Museum, where you can fall in love with the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There are no excursions and souvenirs.
Access is free, and donations are not accepted categorically.
The fifth is the Holocaust Museum or Jad-Vashem in Tel Aviv, which tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section - the child memorial - is built in memory of 1.5 million people destroyed in child shelters and gas chambers.
You're going into it and you're going into absolute darkness.
The stars are marching.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they were killed sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Healing
The three main resorts of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them has swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphins and oceanariums.
It is interesting that the Red Sea is bathed even in the winter months, as the water temperature is not below 21 degrees and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and it has been bathed for a year.
In fact, it is the most unusual sea in the world at the lowest point of the planet at 417 m below sea level.
It has a lasor of salt, which is easy to keep in the blue, even without the ability to swim.
The landscapes around you are not really beautiful.
They come here to be treated with salt water, rap, and heartbreak, and to treat health in dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus, to bring the nerves in order.
Encouraging Ancient Secrets
They're kept by the old part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffo on the Mediterranean coast.
It was followed by the famous Sea route, which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, this is where Noah built his ark, and Persia saved the beauty of Andromeda, with which they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists are very fond of sailing on the narrow streets, named after the signs of Zodiac.
They're talking if you get to the walls on the street of your sign, Fortuna's gonna be kind.
Jaffo can meet young women from all over Israel and even other countries at the photo sessions.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can sail through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusades.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The play is currently being used for evening concerts and opera shows.
A tourist on the note
By sending to Israel, don't worry about your incomplete English: about 30 per cent of the country's people know Russian.
Travel money is better not in the euro but in dollars that are easy to exchange on the shekels (now $1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly bus, but in Jerusalem there is a rapid tram, and in Haife is the only metro station in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City to the Upper.
In fact, it's a underground funnel.
The journey in all urban transport is worth 6 shekels, which can be carried over for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, on the basis of Jewish tradition on the Sabbath, the network is noted.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport cease to work.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without garlic, and dishes, in which milk is compatible with meat.
It offers a wide range of banana and beef, soups and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta humus, various sauces, malt nuts, falalal, fruit and vegetables.
There are no boat dogs on the streets of the Israeli cities.
That's why there's a lot of dehydrated cookies that just "play on their own."
They can be seen in the evening even on the roofs of parked cars.
The ants love human places and do not give up the comforts.
The rental of the car, depending on the brand, ranges from $37 per day (Hyundai Gettz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
In addition to insurance, $15 a day.
And the bike's going to go down at 15 a.m. a day.
Tickets in the museum are in the middle of 30 shekels.
Language of digits
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists worldwide.
Most of the time, U.S. citizens, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine arrived.
There were 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists on Earth, which was 51 per cent more similar to 2010 before the visa was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"Great and capable" will lead to Moscow: migrants are digging money in the language
While MPs and human rights defenders argue that the law on compulsory language testing has already appeared in the country as frauds who are selling “lipid” certificates.
In Moscow, Petersburg and other Russian cities, 13 million gastropods arrive each year.
Most of it is a citizen of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the family.
Since 1 December, the law has entered into force that each migrant worker will be required to submit an examination of the Russian language.
While this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the field of services, housing, housing and retail trade.
However, in time, they promise in the IMF, tests will become mandatory for all arrivals.
In addition to language, Russian history and the framework of legislation will be given.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed both in order to obtain and in order to extend the permit to work.
The exception applies only to nationals of countries where Russian is a public language.
The law does not apply to persons who have been successful in obtaining certificates and diplomas of education prior to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, reliability and protection of rights
The network of examinations will work under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute of Puškina, the University of Peoples' Friendship, the ITU, the GSP and other Russian ties.
Migration tests will be available in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The test initiative was supported by Members of the House and the FMS.
And here, human rights defenders, before the law came into force, have been able to ask the press many times: what is it?
What will change the obligation of knowledge of the language for both the Russians and the arrivals themselves?
First of all, representatives of the Migration Service are responsible for reducing the number of people suffering from “hard slavery”.
Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, as explained by the head of the Mission of the Russian Federation in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment will allow 90 per cent to address the problems of foreign workers.
There are problems with migrants without professions, education that do not know languages that do not have medical examinations.
Without understanding of the language, -- sure Sebelev -- the future migrant is doomed to face the unfavourable people who will take him off to the yellow narrow bar, where he and his ten like him will spend months without food and documents for 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one to their family, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they choose passports, they are not paying the promised salary," says the head of the Labour Migration Management of the ICT Tajikistan Tolib Sharip.
Don't cry, you coward!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian Republic are admitted to working in Russia, they do not only know the language of the country in which they are seeking, but also write to their own.
Of course, it is not as bad as their fault: a few Turkmen, frogs, and tajiks may even have so much primary education.
For in their families there is something to feed children, not to dress, hug, or wear at school.
As they grow up to adulthood, such children are sent to employment at the very earliest opportunity.
It's hard if they're not familiar with the language, they'll admit it.
"You feel humiliated and worthless."
True, the human rights defenders' language law is one important moment.
Tests will only be carried out for migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
However, most of the hosts still live in Russia illegally.
"It's good to welcome you, or the foreign entrance is threatened."
Many of the arrivals claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is in bureaucratic suggestions and all the same language difficulties.
Also, legalization is worth 12 to 16,000 rubles.
And that's how fake registration can be made quickly and in the last half a thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registrations, no warrants.
"A hundred, two on cigarettes, a cup of tea," was shared with reporters from Tajikistan, Umed Hoškadamov.
"Fly, don't pick up, pick up your life."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was found that false documents on registration were not only available.
Several lip-certificates for language testing have already been removed by FMS staff.
Sub-printed paper is printed on a regular colour printer.
Of course, they did not reach new owners: each of the migrants, who hoped to facilitate the test, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is twice as much as the official test procedure: it will hit the migrant in three thousand.
In that the main challenge is to protect the system from corruption in the near future so that “shorts” cannot be simply bought, brought together by government representatives and human rights defenders.
As long as the authorities can promise hosters who have failed to pass the test for the first time, it is time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian arrivals will be offered work in areas that do not involve active contact with people.
IMF does not market illicit arms markets
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is extremely small
The Russian IDB proposes to strengthen the law on the holders of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: To blow fires at the weddings when the victims were killed, and the war that was waged by Moscow's lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the killing of seven people.
Police want to prohibit the use of torture in public places and increase the age from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the think committee on security and anti-corruption of Irina Yarova and promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be made to the House in the near future.
It is not all enough that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "crushing the hooks".
There was an open letter in the network, whose authors, representatives of various public small-scale organizations, were required to reject the "unreasonable increase".
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, according to the Russian Bureau of the B-bi-ci-criminalist Vasili Lesnikov.
According to IMF statistics, 142 firearms were committed in the six months of 2012, while 1168 thousand crimes were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the strengthening of civil weapons legislation does not place the offender on the black market.
Now, they say, any weapon at a low price can be found in Moscow.
In the meantime, the MDGs claim that they control the situation of the proliferation of illicit weapons.
Suppliers: from plants to officers
The black arms market is being filled with several channels.
The main five channels are reported by Colonel Viktor Baranec, who has worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and Gender.
Screenshot of a site that accepts arms orders
The first is an army or military trail, that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Wears have both Russian officers and cowards themselves," said Barantec.
The next type of "black weapons" was stolen by criminals from the forces.
Baranic explains that both police warehouses and law enforcement personnel are included here.
The illegal "stars" are sold from military warehouses.
In many military camps, explosions have often occurred.
"There are proven versions that some of the fires have been made especially to cover the lack," said the former soldier.
According to Barantz, they are imports of weapons producers.
"Now there are private weapons plants that do not support competition on the international market and select weapons from under the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
Another "black" market source is contraband.
In particular, guns and machines from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, are very numerous.
"It has its own production, sometimes artistic, and it's a mafia that has organized a stream," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
The experts considered what an approximate proportion of each of the sources of supply of illicit weapons to the black market.
The report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design in 2011.
Specialists have analysed the reporting of the MDGs and Rosstat, the criminal literature and the open data of the weapons portals.
The overwhelming part of illegal weapons, written by researchers, comes from the army and the force units.
Half of all weapons in the black market have been found “for the fault of armed officials”, the report says.
According to the researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons come from armed conflict sites, 14 per cent of the weapons production takes place, and 5 per cent of the weapons are "black archaeology".
The salesperson of one of the weapons stores, who asked not to name him, assures that weapons found by black miners have long been bought - too old.
Most of the time, he says, a new party of sales is going to war.
Through a gun, a man buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
They're writing it out, handing it over to the hostage.
"He transports it to the city and sells 900 euros here for two shops," he says.
"True, the police in all cases, so periodically when a crime disclosure plan is being set up, they run a check-up with illegal arms dealers," added the consultant.
"As in a luxury store."
The seller and buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I've been looking at sites, blogs, until a friend who's offered to come to the "God" platform, where there's going to be a man who's going to take me to the "angle" where we're going to trade.
I only knew the price of the barn there.
Military Observer Victor Baranek
I need a friend who has a way out, a salesperson tells me I have a friend, but I don't know him.
There's a market salesman, but there's also a need to come, on condition, "from Ivanović, who asked to pass on the teeth of a daughter."
I'm even getting a couple of cassettes through the man I'm sure of.
He's also giving it to me because he knows I'm not going to give it up.
Newspapers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former Military Victor Barantec tried to become a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he prepared an article on it.
The schematics, he says, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where everything was "whatever."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," remembers the soldier.
The buyer, according to Baranza, does not offer the cat in the bag - all you can try.
I'm a potential client, I'm not just buying, we're going with a salesman in the woods, we're putting a bag in there.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm convinced that the weapons are good, we're starting to trade," says the expert.
Smoking store
The Internet search results in sites and groups in "Vkontakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
There is no need for documents and personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in a commercial hat on the "Buy a gun or a machine."
Users leave their applications on it and ask questions.
What about the minors?
"No license, of course," asked the user "Ivan" (orthography preserved).
"T.Moscow Cup" is laconically formulating a "Fedorenkov" request.
The Federal Security Service has now deployed a huge network of grounded sites that want to buy weapons of war with a shovel.
People go like a hungry fish to feed, and then they get to Siberia coal

I have heard of such schemes: the site is usually registered outside Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes a payment through the ATM.
"In response, they send a photo and instruction where weapons are hidden," says Dmitri Kislov, the press secretary of the public organization.
Victor Baraneck claims that by leaving the application on the site, you can remain free of weapons and be re-elected.
The Federal Security Service has now deployed a huge network of grounded sites that want to buy weapons of war with a shovel.
"People go like a hungry fish on a cobblestone, and then they get to Siberia," he says.
Makeovers for $100
The purchase of illegal small arms, according to expert estimates, can be made from $100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitria Kislova of the Arms Rights organization, the Macarova gun can be purchased for $100-300.
It'll take a month and a half.
It is disbursed from long-term storage stocks by the management of those medium-term stocks.
According to the official statistics of the department, the number of such crimes in general in Russia decreased by 7 per cent compared to January 2011 and by 22.9 thousand, and the number of reported incidents of the theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the United States, fast food and supermarkets are based
MacDonalds works through all four American teenagers.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in the Walmart corporations and fast-food restaurants, such as McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendis and Kentucky Freide Chechen.
Until no one predicts whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave or will be sentenced to an early stage.
The actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries received by several Walmart workers and the fast-food system, the goal of protestors is to establish trade union organizations in them.
Until this sector is almost covered by trade union movements.
46 cents a year?
The shares began last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday", when the United States was disrupted by cheap sales, captured by millions of residents and sometimes accompanied by bribes.
On that day, some Walmart corporate workers, with 2.2 million people worldwide working, left their jobs and took part in the company's trade unions and left-wing activists, whose goods are calculated on the basis of modest and medium-sized resources.
Walmart sells everyone in the light, from chicken, wild roses and car batteries to chickens, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores averaged 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Thus, many low-paid Walmart workers are only retired to work.
The availability and assortment of goods made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart may allow itself to sell the goods in part because he pays little to his employees.
The latter also complains about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of autoloaders or hand scanners.
The Black Friday shareholders demanded a higher salary and noted that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart employee, who received $9.5 an hour, was not a carnival, they said.
Researchers at the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart would raise the average salary to $12 per hour, it would be worth $3.2 billion.
It's about 1.1% higher than it's spending on pay now.
If Walmart completely shifts pay on the buyers' shoulders, each visit to the store will be about 46 cents away.
In a year, they're going to spend $12,39 more than they're now.
The Walmart participants note quite well that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any minor damage to corporations.
"Black Friday" continued in her shops from 8 hours of dinner Thursday to midnight the next day, while Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of almost 100 million transactions were made in the Black Friday.
The representative of Dan Fogelman argued in an interview with the left site Huffington Post that the jobs had left a total of "less than five" Walmart staff, and that the protest was the most "special pirate" of its trade union.
"Free bag!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not the Walmart University (which is why they are not here) and McDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonalds says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and doesn't pay you for your honest work!
Jumee Williams, a member of the New York Forest
At the moment, the minimum wage, under federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
Restaurants of fast food in time increase it, but do not know it, and on average, their number of workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one earns less of them in this city.
How can there be money in New York, it's impossible for me.
Sometimes, through McDonalds, there were four U.S. teenagers who had been working for them after school, living with their parents.
Few have seen in this main source of supply or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I'm constantly getting into an interview with McDonald's employees, who are complaining that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed children on it.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum hangs a comment, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them for.
Participants in protests, which began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonalds on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food companies start paying at least $15 an hour, more than doubled their current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of trade union organizations in the area of fast food.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing trade union activists with bribery and dismissal.
On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates their lives.
But it is difficult for the trade union to deal with fast food for objective reasons.
One of the main is an unusual flow of staff.
Inconsistencies
The noise protests took place on that day and in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The summit took place in the middle of a meeting at McDonalds near the Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the Jumein Williams forest, who said, "Macdonalds," said he was selling billions of shares, and then he didn't even give you any hospitals or pay you for your honest work."
The demonstrators also supported other prominent New York democracies, such as Bill De Blasio's mayor, who said that "we need to join fast-food workers in order to achieve a fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves."
As described by the New York Times, this was the largest action in the history of the American fast food field.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, but not all of them were workers of a quick welcome in which tens of thousands of people were employed in New York.
It's not clear if this spark of mass movement is going to give birth.
"To deceive the brain gets the average."
A popular theme among modern technology lovers has recently been the subject of the added reality to be perceived mainly through the perception of special points.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference, Google showed, and then in November it became known that the application for the patent in question had been submitted to Microsoft.
However, the interview with the leader of the 3D interactive technology group at the Cambridge Laboratory Microsoft Sharam Izadi shows that the eyepiece is a phased one for researchers in this company.
Their perspective is to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, to create virtual open spaces.
- Tell me, please, what's your research team doing?
- We're dealing with human interaction with machines, but we're trying to shift the boundaries of this interaction.
While mankind in mass has been stuck in the process of working with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes beating them with their fingers.
We would like to look at the five to ten years ahead and predict the dramatic changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is sold without Kinect, because it's all interestingly bad management.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Despite Kinect's physical interaction, a lot is still taking place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data) and the conclusion is not very yet.
We're trying to change it, we're really working on three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projectives.
We need to release computer peace into our physical world to make it more committed.
To that end, however, we need to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more comfortable way.
And first of all, these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voting?
Popular art, but aren't they re-evaluating it?
He certainly cannot be called a panacea - a matter of privacy, because he does not always want to tell the surrounding people about his actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interactions with computers are good, but each one in his own nest.
For example, we had a project to manage devices in public places, where we thought about gestures, but not over bulky, but over such expensive, short ones.
This was not the device’s camera, but the hand bracelet that fixed the movements of the bones and muscles.
As long as it's large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the manual hours.
But in general, the future for a mixed type of management, for example, a gesture+voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to hand you this newspaper bank?
You'll say and show at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, that'll be very difficult to recognize.
- Do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine might or may not be able to do at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual bond.
I think that in the near future, we will have to work mainly on developing new types of sensors that will allow for a more accurate identification of human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a poor depth clearance, it's very important.
- If you're talking about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Not enough permits, depths, or anything else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be avoided in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at 1000 k/s.
But it's not in the megapixels itself, but as a matrix and depth.
From a recent point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds to the work of algorithms designers.
So we need to remember not only the X and Y axis clearance, but Z.
It's also a very important speed, the number of personnel per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s are extremely small, especially for gestures.
Steven Betisses from our Redmond Laboratory made a sensor relationship with a controlled delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between humans and machines.
I would be very comfortable in my work with the equivalent of such a device, but not demanding that the staff be increased by one second.
- And you don't have to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared trigger, and the other is a signal receiver.
And here's the third camera, that's actually the normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A potential greater number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or increase it by increasing the amount of the calculations required.
It would be a shame to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the camera's critical position, and see how that would help in the three-dimensional definition of the situation.
I remember Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present his eyes to the audience.
Don't you think that the daily use of the technology of the supplementary reality of the eye is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, it's not very convenient to keep the smartphone in your hands, but I think the coolest option would be the "walking" added reality, when you could switch from point to point to smartphone, projection display and further away.
The eyes are a very personal device, in which their strength (private things you only see), and at the same time, a weakness - added reality based on the eyes will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a minute that the manipulation of virtual golographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the Iron Man, but to the mortal.
There is one problem often identified by criticism of this idea: there is no tactical response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your group's responses to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh in terms of a breakthrough in human and machine interaction.
I think the eighth could be just the addition of tactical sensations.
While one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a self-imposed base for images.
She's doing great!
But there are technologies that are really aimed at adding these "air-carts" to senility - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic tapes at a certain point where there is a finger gives a feeling, but while it's very weak - it's like you've been hit by a finger.
There are also locks that affect the nerve endings in your fingers, as well as a positive direction.
- Did you try to fool your brain?
To make him think he feels what he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried to do that yet.
There is another challenge that has to be tackled for a long time - how to force a person physically in a very limited space to believe that he is going on an open, practically endless, work and on the concepts of escape routes (not just in clubs) moving platforms, as well as huge layers.
While the brain is being fooled by averages, work is still very much for many years.
This is what works on the virtual reality of such attractive to the researcher - a lot of things at an absolutely early stage.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the Peterburg Avant-garde project on the citizens who are in advance in the cultural and artistic avant-garde.
The list already includes bright actors of the Petersburg Art Scene, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, with far-reaching knowledge.
The new "Rosbalt" hero is an epic artist, Kiril Miller.
The whole city is known as Cyril Miller, a bearded man dressed in all red that is meeting at the Russian Museum, now in Summer, in fashion bags and reindeer.
Kiril Miller's paintings always collect audiences wherever they don't show.
Kiril Miller is one of the major socio-philosophical historians in Petersburg, who created new mythologies.
Kiril Miller is a bright man from the late '80s to the early '90s.
He is also a city man, with his appearance on the streets causing a smile at the village, raising the whole mood.
He had recently taken a charm and became a peterburg charmer, for he had created for this difficult role all his divine existence, philosophy and image.
Kiril, why are you still walking around the city all red, not yellow or red, for example?
- I've chosen a red color as a model of a kind and an image.
In this world, the red color is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker and a society.
While everything in society is not feeling serious, it is a cause for aggression and the emergence of bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to a discussion.
- And when did you realize he was supposed to be an artist?
- At the D.C. Nevsky, where my work was shown.
I realized it was my way.
Then the wave of the old free informal artists passed, and the new, free-types were hard to find.
I began to associate with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gason girl who led to Puškinski-10, and there was no more wave.
I'm left in the theater, in the clothes, in the music, in all the genres, except words.
And all of this has come together in your art clinic... and it was important for me to feel at the center of Petersburg's culture, where all the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied the territory in Puškinski-10, and there was a music-artist club, a religious club, a peterburg house.
Many were born there: NOME, Tequila-Jaz, I remember Schnura bringing with the "Echo Van Goga" project.
Schnur and his friends sang easy songs under the banner, they were in the moving trick, among them was the modern composer Igor Vdwin.
When the group played live, she became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the leader of many programs until the Hali-gali era.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and he's gone a great career, and he's been given basic education and education.
Gallery D 137, Griboedov Club, it's from Art Clinics.
That's where our workers and they've gone forever.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the name of "Journey of the Year," I was named, and my culmination ended.
In new times, it's hard to work on old rules, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, it can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work has a familiar manner.
- Many of my paintings are tricky, they have a clear sense of relevance and severity.
I'll have a program show, the Russian Museum in the Clooney.
Clooney is an emergency category.
I used to be social, now being like this is painful and scary.
But the clowns are freezing, the tragedy is taking off.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through totalitarian reincarnation.
They are now wearing clothes, focusing on external mechanics, not on internal man.
Oh, maybe he can't have his hand and spit in the rose.
And the lie will be taken away by means of a garment.
We recently saw you as a city charmer.
Who I don't want to be.
- Can commercial art be beautiful, too?
- Business art must now be accurate, tactical, sweet.
It's going to be cultural disintegration.
People used to be in a room, a god loved one another, and a god loved the other.
Now it's all broken down into a micro community, and it's hard to like everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar paper so everyone likes it.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now there are 100 worshipers of each cult hero.
- And Stash Mikhailov's coming in a few thousand!
- He's got a gun, there's a sex-social field working.
And 300 people will come to the cultural soil, and 10,000 will not come, and as a result, less management, money, they'll all come out.
I have worshipers, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to export them in vain.
In my youth, I wrote such paintings that they have one collector on the wall next to Falco and Larion's hangings.
I started with pictures that usually end up.
Now there's a lot of misunderstandings.
They say: spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I was a man of yesterday's culture, grew up in the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money to paint pictures.
I'm for that kind of culture.
- Kiril, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
That's the idea: an official of culture.
But not every one of them can be a culture.
In the case of the right kings, the kings may not have understood much in the culture, but they understood that they needed to keep the right experts.
Here's good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're called, because they need higher experts who will properly assess these experts and give them the road.
Now it's a taste.
The same is true of Erart, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we take, there are artists who must look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, much more culture in Moscow, there is soil.
And on our rocks, it's hard to grow.
We need cultural soil, and we have writers now more than readers, it's wrong.
Here are a lot of interesting people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of tone.
We need to do modern art, as it was in the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented by St. Petersburg Grant
Born into Space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with an asteroid-killer.
Ships of spacecraft with land on board are sent to search for a reserve planet.
In order to preserve mankind, is there a major question about how to continue their generation in the face of ignorance or on the same saving planet?
I think it's a small choice.
In fact, the present planet is only two that can be captivated at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," the senior scientific officer of the State Astronomical Institute named P.C. Sternberg (GAISH) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions are more suitable for life in Mars, the surface area of Venus is 500 degrees.
It's possible to live only on high altitudes or orbits of Venus... in space.
The question of reproduction in space began with flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
The four generations raised in the orbit of the mountain were no different from their earthly classes.
Then we're going to take out on the orbit of the insect, the little fruit fly-drozofil.
In 1979, an egg was sent to space to check how the embryo develops in pregnancy.
We're getting a perfectly normal bird out.
And that's where the problem starts.
"The problem of the bird's need to find resistance, he has to get up on his feet and start moving," explains RAN Vladimir Sichev, the head laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP).
I didn't find any resistance, the birds were unscrupulous.
Within 10 hours, a complete atrophy of the instincts occurred in newborns.
The birds did not react to light and sound.
And the trouble was that in four days they just died.
"And twice we've dug out the birds, then we've given up because it's just impossible to work with them," notes the experiment with birds in the space of Vladimir Sichev.
With animals the last time a biological "minico" flew to orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, experiments will continue.
However, only one-half persons will be on Bion's biographies.
There was an experiment with crosses that were sent to space with fruit.
In principle, they did not find anything supernatural.
"This was once on the biospheres, but again it is a unique experiment, and such research needs to be carried out," notes Vladimir Sichev.
After the land was planted in the outer space, a seed appeared.
But come to the problem of reproduction directly into space until it's done.
Simple task.
Animal, losing, and habitually living, simply cannot achieve their sexual instincts.
But a man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a better emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women in space have been flying for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Teresco.
And the most precious thing there is in mankind is a woman's organism.
Our Chaika flew, and no one on Earth could say, "Will he stay after the flight to space?"
Is she supposed to have a baby after that flight?
"No one has answered this question," says the veteran rocket-space industry of the Wachtang Vakanda.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight to space, the first woman, Valentina Tereskova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andrian Nikolaev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savicka, a second woman with a cosmonaut, was born twice in orbit and even in open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have little, units of space, with long flights, and a healthy generation grows.
"And if more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," says the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valerie Polakov.
Nevertheless, mankind needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPC Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory phase of flight preparation.
In this context, under zero flexibility, spacecrafts develop open space work skills.
Water imitates insanity.
If for adult water, let it be comfortable, but still a strange environment, for babies, it's a birthplace.
Small self-esteems seem to confirm that life on the land has come out of the ocean.
There is a connection between having a baby for about 9 months in the mother’s fluid, making it easier for her to get used to the shower later.
In principle, this is logical because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, only two weeks have passed.
"It's very little to forget something," says the nurse Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if the pregnancy of the unborn child is more natural, a woman needs gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in the womb the muscles of life, the taza, fall into the ability to extract the fruit.
All right, let's just drop this by relying on birth-stimulators.
Of course, in a special camera to go to birth, she's gonna pull him out.
"And what else?" asked Valerie Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling Earth's tension, the organism does not form skeletons and the muscle system.
It is impossible for a newborn to wear a special training load suit as an adult.
He's just going to be deprived of what he's going to need.
"And this experiment that we're going to go to, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled, fully disadapted person to Earth," the head of the Committee on Bioethics IMBP RAN Igori Pestov said.
Until the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
In time, however, it will be a reality when the earth on its own ships will travel to a distant planet that will be a home for their descendants born in space.
Chief of the Audit and Audit Management: Checking the system has failed on the part of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, remains in application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Chief Audit Office, in an interview with Aktualně.cz.
"The law will never be ideal, but it must be applied properly, which I think is not enough," commented Kala's current situation.
Such findings provide a joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of wrong practices, Peter’s approach to a so-called fraud system is sometimes used.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that GDP (Grazdan Democratic Party) would not concern entrepreneurs with checks - is this prohibited or allowed?
“The law should be established in any way, and if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of institutions which are obliged to verify and strive for compliance with obligations,” said Kala.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared the laws on public procurement of both countries.
What exactly was that about?
There's a parallel check we started two years ago.
I simply say that European legislation affirms how public procurement should be carried out, and national legislation should be followed and then applied in practice.
All the information was collected and, even in the case of an unresolved verification, interesting differences were found - but we could have legislation "right and without error", but in practice, we are applying certain parameters to Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules to focus on the application of the law itself.
And actually, how can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is such joint control that can contribute to efforts to halt the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, as this does not lead to a positive result.
The economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid wealth and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not the fact that we're going to achieve this by reducing the limit of orders.
Perhaps this system will be filled with bubbles so that those who want to find laziers in this system will find them much easier than if the limit had not been reduced.
You are talking about internal problems in the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there an organization such as our CIA (Control and Audit) or is it working otherwise?
With regard to institutions, there is the Bundesrechnschaftshof, which is based on our principle, there is also a college that works a little differently, but mainly both institutions operate in a similar way.
In addition, the powers to a certain extent are similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at federal level, their system differs somewhat from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounts.
With regard to local legislation, is that just what we have?
In fact, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it cannot be said that it is best in all.
Is that because they're better at controlling?
It's definitely not, but I repeat, I don't like these comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't benefit from cooperation with our office, would they?
When it comes to domestic legislation, how has the amendment to the Government Procurement Act affected your institution, and how do they affect you?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is short enough, it has not yet appeared in our control work.
As we control the facts, some delays need to be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future checks - we have started using our new tool "to identify the risk of inefficiency", through which we have pursued almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them, and these changes will, of course, be made, because restrictions are changing, changing the conditions of some types of tenders and so on.
Do you think that the adoption of this law would benefit or add weight to the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will be "enhancing" and that they will not be complied with.
In the course of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes, to the regional council) that any non-compliance with the State Procurement Act means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it appropriate to strengthen the law in such a way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who wish to take and abuse but do not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the solution.
Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead to anything.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the GDP will not concern entrepreneurs with the checks of the so-called fraud system.
"Swirl system" prohibited or permitted?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the bodies which are obliged to verify and strive for the fulfilment of obligations.
We can say, "We change this law and let it go," but we can't say that we're going to pretend that nothing's going on.
The Government Procurement Act contains rather strict rules, as must be formally implemented, and that is correct, which will protect public procurement.
On the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best proposal is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, which I think we do not have enough.
The roads are rocky, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are freezing and snowy.
They're basically passing, but something more careful.
Karlovary County
This morning the roads in the Karlovar coast were passing, but some frozen and snowy.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but the temperature should be less warm during the day.
The snowfall in the region has ceased, but only a small layer lies below.
However, on the back of the Red Mountains is about 30 centimeters [30 cm] of snow.
From the information received from road workers, it was known that the places were lower visibility due to fog.
The R6 and the first-class roads in the region are now under way without restrictions.
However, attention needs to be given, for example, to bridges where the surface can be moist and slippery.
All roads relating to the second and third classes, including mountain trails, are also accessible.
But in some of their areas, the remains of frozen snow are still present.
Particular attention should be paid to the roads at the heights.
Pardubic and Royal Garden
The management of Czech roads and highways on its pages on the Internet informs that some roads in eastern Czech Republic are threatened with famine, while snow may be on mountain roads and high roads.
Regional road workers warn drivers of the famine, which can be trained especially at the heights of the Pardubic coast.
Gololed can be around Lanskroun, Usti-on-Orlici, Polički, Switavi or High Mito, especially on the roads of the second and third class.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located in Switzerland, processed by chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of the Giant Mountains and the Orlick Mountains.
The snowflake is on the roads at the heights of the Rihnova-sur-Kengen and Trutnova districts.
In eastern Czechia, there is a changing cloud with no precipitation.
The temperature usually varies from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, a light wind.
Pulsenian Region
The roads in the Plzeň coast are passing this morning, but places need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning, the temperature fluctuates from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places, it can be cold.
Drivers can meet the fog, but visibility will improve gradually.
Regional road workers provided information.
Shosse D5 is now practically unrestricted, but road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the first class roads have dry and frozen surfaces.
In southern Pulsa and Tahowa, there may be frozen areas.
The second and third class roads are wet, and in this case there is also warning of the possibility of rolling sites.
Drivers should be careful, especially on the few roads used in the Shumawa area.
Olomoutsk
The leaders of the Olomouc coast must today take into account the snowfall on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Red Sea and on the road towards the Videlian Cross.
On the night of the snowfall, some three centimeters of snow fell on the street of the road workers, according to information from the road management.
In other parts of the road, there are usually no restrictions.
"The snow remains on the heights of the Schumperka.
The leaders on the side of Esenika must bear in mind the presence of snowflakes in the Cherveneur Seedle," ČAN (Czech News Agency) reported today.
At night the roads were cleared and their colleagues from Esenika, convinced that the roads on the highlands had remained bare and wet after the chemical treatment.
In Olomouca, roads are unrestricted, but in Sternberg, drivers must be careful at forest areas where moisture remains.
Ossetian coast, Liberian coast
In the morning, road workers from northern Bohemia reported that there were still a few difficult places to go.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several locations with ice or snow, the mountain road is closed at the Telnica station in the Usteck region.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lows, so snow and ice remain on the roads, especially in the south-east of the Czech Republic, on the other hand, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
There's still no problem on the roads.
Road workers report the appearance of a famine in the districts of Stety.
According to meteorologists, the ideal conditions for his education were created at night: the rain and the snow covered the whole day, the night sky was brightened and the frosts began.
The unfavourable conditions are reported on the main axes and on the I/13 route on the coast of Usteck and Liberia.
Because of the snowy layer of trees on the road itself, they were forced to close the road in Telnica at the Knice.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to buy positive energy
What do you think, that less than a month later, the end of the world should come?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we, people, are so easy to find.
Together with The Tap Tap Group, we are constantly shooting at this topic and we are saying that we are the only group in the world that will be able to collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give an absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Would you please tell your readers more about this?
This is a national fund-raising event that we have been planning for two years.
We have decided to take advantage of the marketing capacity that may have been announced at 11:10 a.m. on 21 December.
On the day before that event, three concerts are held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava in parallel at 21:00.
They end, hard to say, at a time when the May Calendar will be completed at the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours earlier than we do.
Who's got this idea in his head?
That was my idea, and we've all been thinking about it together with our artist Gonza Augustan.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about how we will once pass this world over to our children.
In the event of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of items from shoes, soccer, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These items can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz and thus provide support to us.
The Tap Tap Group, along with other musicians, also performed a gimn against the end of the light, which is called the End of the Light.
Will your favorite YouTube audiences sound gimmn at these beneficial concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if the end of the world does not come.
It will be held by all executives at all concerts at the same time.
Gymnasiums will also sound in the direct air of Czech television.
This song was written and played by Jesus in the clip by Thomas Ganga, also involved in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other people in Czech cultural life, as we conduct many charity activities and concerts.
We are actively trying to link them to these projects.
It turns out that a lot of people like to work with us, they're interesting.
What's going to happen when the concert goes against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the STUDEO wireless educational centre, for the sixth year, we have been working with the Tap civil association at the Edlicka Institute.
Teachers regularly visit students at the Edlicka Institute and conduct fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.
As part of the project for the further construction of the institution of Edlicka, there will be a separate building in which we will move with the project.
There will be several music groups and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to establish a programme that interests all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague are spoken Chinese, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irgy Suhi.
Both details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “Graditional activities” in the future?
In May, we will be the first to attend the Prague Spring Festival and, of course, we will prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
The following year we would be pleased to have a presentation at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we were in the United States, would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
In view of your serious plans, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with limited opportunities.
How do you deal with the way of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it seems to be first.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs should travel in the trunk, plus a large number of items and boxes with tools.
The Czech ČSA and British Airways aircraft have always been excellently prepared for us, which I was surprised to see.
Even in Moscow, where we just got back, everything went smoothly.
You can compare with different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations with people with disabilities and so on.
What have you been up to now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, in Russia we have witnessed that the East is still at the base level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are many barriers, and there is still a separate movement of people on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also, there is no such thing as walking along the path of the disabled in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with limited opportunities.
What, on the other hand, should we always reach out to the leading countries?
There's a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's perfectly normal that people with a severe form of disability move on their own on the streets, can go to the bathroom, to the museum, wherever you want...
It is not very common for a large number of people with limited opportunities to participate actively in public life, in this with The Tap Tap a little overrun!
Respect for the public or freedom of the public is one thing, but when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, we will all really change.
As long as these are unique cases, people with strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is now very popular, but we'll be back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I went to the Edlicka Institute as an educator, and I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself, including a saxophone, I've organized an interesting musical circuit together with my colleague.
Well, in time, as our leading Lady Angelovic says, it's a little out of control.
But the popularity has come only in recent years, or am I something?
That's true, it helped us to start joining famous singers and actively working on the group's propaganda.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can evaluate is essentially as if there were no.
Through the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was the goal of breaking The Tap Tap so well in front of you?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential to do something unusual.
In show business, it's full of things that look like each other.
That's logical, all the new ones are taking care, and it's been a long time.
There are very few things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, is of course...
But this grief is extremely excessive, because people with limited opportunities are not some suffering and all the missing persons that we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities get something, it's not just for them, it's for society as well.
Has the success of being the strict leader of many of you proved successful?
If we want to do work qualitatively, we must be in many things uncompromised and have certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and fly in the clouds, and when they know that twice a week they have to go to reintroduction, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose their enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
The Tap Tap is currently a group of twenty people.
How many were there in early 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent it.
For those who have will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place on the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20.12.2012, at 2 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno, Fléda Club and Ostrave, in the centre of Plynoj with 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are united by a telestom at the time of the song of The Tap Tap "The End of the Light Is Canceled".
The aim of the project is to fund 25 million crowns for the purchase of multifunctional wireless equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Edlicka Institute in Prague.
The ticket is 400 kroner for children under 12 years of age free of charge. Tickets can be purchased in Bohemiaticket in advance.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twenty-second member of the European Space Agency as a second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ECA in 1994 and participated actively in a number of Agency projects over the years.
But the way to the Polish space began a long time ago.
By the time of World War II, Polish enthusiasts were traveling to space, but this did not always come about with understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture A. Sternfeld, which on 6 December 1933 presented to the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory an idea from his innovative work "Introduction into Space".
The ideas of a young engineer (1905 B.C.E.) left an audience with an equal spirit, and after a few years, Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltri and Andre Luis Hirsch Prize in France for "Introduction to Space".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great advocate of astronomy and cosmonautique.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
The Gadomian became known as the world's propaganda of space, and his contribution was assessed, including that one of the craters on the other side of the Moon was named in his honor.
In 1925 a railway wire equipped with a rocket was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as was the project ' s details.
It is not even clear that a missile should have been used for the explosion or for the braking of the body.
Information on this site is only known from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery has begun to think about rockets.
The study was conducted by the Arms Technology Section, in cooperation with Professors McCisslav Wolfe and Gustav Mozzicki.
The remaining material shows that the studies have been carried out in the course of practical tests.
But the arrival of the German labour force was interrupted.
In 1937, the special press came up with the idea of a photoelectric missile by Rogosinski, and the following year, the work “Aerial Torpedo and Aerial Bombing Missile” was carried out by the author of Leviva-Kvijoblokko.
Both projects were designed for the military use of missile engines.
Prior to the war itself, all projects of military use of missile technology were undertaken by the Temporary Scientific and Advisory Committee (Tymczaswi Committee Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, work was completed due to the beginning of the war.
The following scientific work on space was carried out in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautic Society.
For the first time, the issue of society was mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the “Problems”, which published four volume articles on astronomy.
In one of them, Professor M. Sobotovic proposed that a society be organized that would be occupied by spacecraft.
At the time, the projects of artificial satellites were already underway, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronomical Society (POA) has tried to enter the international Astronomical Federation (based in 1951), and has already become its true member in autumn.
And next year, the first President of POA, Kazimej Zarankevic, (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in this post until his death, which occurred in 1959.
Since 1956, POA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological missile RM (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna), which has become the first Polish rocket to conduct a scientific study.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, capable of exceeding 1,800 metres, was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
The improved version of RM-1A was subsequently built and two-stage RM-2 tests were carried out in the Bledud desert in 1959.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already capable of doing this scientific work - the RM-34 missile could be over 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the high winds.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
The first RM-type missile was the Meteor-1 missile, which was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, which differ in size from the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had an area of 0.4 l, Meteor-1B - 0.34 l, and Meteor-1C - 0.62l.
The maximum distance of the flight in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 missile was developed at the Aviation Institute and its first summer tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with an initial weight of 380 kg was able to extract a useful load of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland ' s entry into COSPAR ( Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, within the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space research on Soviet artistic satellites, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslav Hermasevski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Law on Public Works.
The decision triggered a lively discussion in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with one another.
This is related to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted private capital movements, along with unscrupulous financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the value of the labour force (wages) there is a significant tension.
In this sense, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, through the delivery of the cheap goods, is trying to withstand economic competition by reducing the value of the competitor in order to take most of the market and thus increase its own income.
As a result, unemployment is rising in countries where labour costs are higher than in others.
Since private capital has no social responsibility, including for its unemployment, the inevitable costs of the State for social needs are increasing.
In general, the situation is exacerbating the willingness of employers to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social and economic damage they suffer in the pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistical data.
Non-ceremoned private capital practices create at the level of the economies of individual States when Governments have to compete with each other to artificially reduce the social level of their people to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments are giving their own population a profit on private capital, despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in changes in existing legislation.
It is the goal of economically forcing its people to submit to the dictatorship of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool to cut workers ' rights in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty is rising, and the gap between the poor and the rich is still growing.
For several years there has been a public distribution of products to poor people who are unable to feed themselves with their own work.
The number of people is approaching a million.
As part of the competitiveness of the German economy, there are always cases where employed people receive such wages that the State must pay them to obtain a minimum of living.
A similar scandal has also become known to the public in the case of additional workers in Budapest.
Economic measures in almost all southern EU States undoubtedly lead to the same condition as those under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in social status, forced to migrate, as in the 19th century, or to be on a poor wage at the expense of society, hoping that private investment will ever come into the country.
But where does he come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turk, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for the share of European wages.
This is true of all Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim that the State cannot participate in equity, which leads to economic disaster.
The private capital insists that the State should not be involved in the economy by administrative actions.
Should private capital, now practically managing policies and so on by the entire State, be answered for its own selfish purposes?
The only answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of almost all-powerful and vast lobbying in all States.
As a result, we have an unprecedented situation in corruption, mutual benefit, legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but it is not a crime.
In the AWG, the situation is such that public ministries, due to the lack of funding, mandate the development of draft laws to private legal firms that are closely related to industry.
The bill then approved the Bundestag.
All power is not from the people, as the Western Constitution states, but from the financial-strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal democracy is now rapidly taking place in the situation described by Appian in the production of "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "The State has long broken down, and the authorities are engaged in violence.
Takeovers, illegal receipt of mercy by means of stones and swords.
Encouraging and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to the elections with a voice that was previously sold."...the people who were executed did not vote for the governor's office, and at the end of one day the State remained without a consulate for eight months. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As in ancient times, today’s society has its own unreasonable interests without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is, in fact, no longer intended for public use.
The present outcome is not different from the previous: the improper fall of the elite without any effort to carry out a deeper reform.
That is why fascist and communist regimes should be brought up, and we must seek to liberalize the economic systems for 19 and 20 centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be seen as a certain pause, followed by the next round.
Above all, it is tragic that the present elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of future victims, the humanitarian and social disasters that we have already observed, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The repeal of the Law on Public Works is not a decision or at least not always.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The decision is the aim of political and social reforms that will strengthen the left participation of States in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the State and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will come out of violence, and it will never go out" -- Sting, the song "Hrunky", where the main verse is, "We don't forget what we're doing."
"If my sons didn't want a war, they wouldn't be "a dying Guttel Snaper, Meera Amshel Rothschild's wife.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, caused many reactions.
Some speak for Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence, while Palestinians act as terrorists, others support Palestinians, arguing for it by Israeli State racism, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I don't want to think about who in these periodic repeated killings was a criminal and who, at the end of the day, Israeli citizens, including self-government territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation, and were not witnesses of the beginning of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to take a look at the entertainment, to look at those who have been serving for the past 95 years in the small area of the Middle East (referring to the signing of the Balfort Declaration in November 1917).
Some of my discussions are supported by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of fighting for power.
In each era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their steps completely independently, or have been behind their throne by someone who has led them to the pre-destined goals.
It should be allowed that we live in a period when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of several people, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not occur for the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families, there is one that could be considered the head of the platform (I don't know if anyone is on top of them, but it's not off) - Rothschild.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) has been bought in the 1990s to stop hearings that link their names to criminal acts in the higher spheres in which they were, and which have always led to their strengthening of power, wealth, or at the same time, and to others.
They have large stock packs in almost all central banks of the world and against countries in which central banks do not have their share, they lead or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the invasion of Cadafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian Government took the central bank of its country into its hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, began to issue his own (minor - government) money during the civil war and was killed in the theatre in 1865.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System), which was killed in 1963. MP Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to bring the FED to court for the dissolution of the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their desire for the world power from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of the plan of the three world wars, established by the 33rd-level massive Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchic States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third was to bring about a reduction of about 0.5-1 billion people (which would be sufficient to provide their comfort and shine and would not need many resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and the ultimate acceptance of the absolute authority.
The method used by a group of the richest families in the head with the Rothschilds is the challenge of the crisis and the next proposal of decisions (order ab chao - order of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, which had to prevent the recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to unblock World War I through the murder of the Habsburg heir to the Austrian-Hungarian throne in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Royal Russia, starting the multi-wisdom revolution.
The first world war ended with a sudden, unwarranted war on Germany's military and economic capital (there was no need for a war to destroy the royal Russia) and as a result, the Central European Power, Austria and Hungary had been split.
In order to facilitate the deployment of World War II, bankers and politicians have created a hidden conflict situation by imposing huge military repairs on Germany, rather than creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of the mass of decommissioned people, and then it was left to push only Germans to a strong enough, responsible and offering simple solutions to the leader, to further create a multi-national Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed to play the function of the fifth column in the fire of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschilds provoked the foundation of a Zionist movement, one of which sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historical Judah and Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfort declaration provided a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The Second World War had begun, it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had been expelled from the ranks where he was originally held by the bankers or all he had done was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps had created a prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially established in 1948 and, as Germany was provoked by military reparations for the Second World War, the State of Israel was called upon to create a door to the third war.
If international bankers succeed in disbanding it, the Jewish people, as well as in the second world war, will be the victim of a war on the front, now with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of disparity and chaos not only within the country but also at the international level (to bring only a sharp division of people against Israel's opponents and opponents).
Who is responsible, and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the insults are caused by an endless cycle of violence, if it all begins with the desire of individuals and their desire for the world power?
There is a need to distinguish the usual people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we do, international banks are forcing people to vote on elections only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Yastreb Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker, who is doing everything to start war with Iran, which, through Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan) will threaten to become a world conflict, and given Iran's control over the Ormous Gulf, which contains 20% of all world oil stocks (the maritime corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a common crisis, and people will receive a new world order."
The new world order in their presentation is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serve a harsh financial aristocracy that enjoys comfort.
A world where every birth-bearing organism is implanted with a chip with which it becomes a substance under total control.
"And causes all the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves to have on their right hand, or on their foreheads, so that a man who is not noted by the name of that beast, or by the number of his name, may neither buy nor sell.
Here is wisdom. Anyone with intelligence can calculate the number of beasts.
Because it corresponds to the human name, and that number is sixty-six.
"Argo Operation" movie: When it's worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamic Protestant students captured the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats into custody.
They were to be released in exchange for the twisted chess of Mohammed Reza Pehlevi, who had fled after the U.S. revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
The U.S. administration did not expect a positive outcome - it could not have allowed itself to throw the chess out of the ship, because it could have undermined the trust of allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not in a position to do so.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by a unsuccessful attempt to free hostages from the force.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations with the Government of Algeria.
Their fate was a cause for concern in the home of solidarity and anti - Iran.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential elections, which ended with Ronald Reagan.
The film by an actor named Ben Afflek "Argo Operation" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought small victories to America.
Soon before the embezzlement of the embassy, six workers were able to escape.
After difficult peripecies, they completed their journey to the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, with the help of an extravagant cover-up legend that they had gone on Canadian passports as members of the so-called " Space Group " that sought a place in the country for the scientific and fantastic era.
Group of Genres
The plan, invented by an evacuation expert, Tony Mendes, demanded the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order to be reliable, specialized journals wrote about the film project, a press conference was held, and the proposed production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept in secret for a long time, a film based on the memories of Tony Mendes.
Afflek's film is a special combination of several women.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, so-called "film-kinoops", the story of a successful funeral, an affair - for example, could be a number of films about Ouchen friends.
The film constantly changes the moods - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (the headlines show the landmark historical photographs of events and how the same situations were shown in the film - there are no major differences in that).
On the other hand, smoothed Hollywood cracks that cross with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions -- the men in the costumes are discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, on the ladders of the institutions, on the phone...
Ben Afflek has been able to start a career.
The actor was a respected director and his game ceased to be the object of ridicule.
Operation Argo his third full-time film, after the dark detective "Excusement, Child, Forgiveness" (2007) and the Triller "Grod" (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Afflek film that's not filmed in Boston's hometown.
The feeling of the local atmosphere is one of the qualities of the earlier filmmakers over the Hollywood standard.
And Afflek shows it in Argo, where Teheran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, when real events are reconstructed, the introductory scenes of the embassy fall impress with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when history suddenly changes.
The effect of Afflek and his colleagues is similar in the scene of the inventions (sub-station at the Tegeran Base).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the presentation did not imply a lot of cinematographical scenes.
He works pretty well with this little one, sometimes something he thinks - it's not so elegant in there (the scene where the phone call in America prevents the rising crisis at Tegeran Airport, and the flight-season race looks pretty clever).
The lack of Argo is a dissipation of the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are really very promising, but their characters would deserve more space, and they're not the only ones in the movie.
Afflek's film is not a little dramatic, it's a film that can be viewed with moderate interest, evaluating the order and the retro-style that re-establishes the seven-year-old triller.
But he's busy.
However, this is enough to remind us of one, still known in the sense of living history, as well as to give evidence of the exaggerated representations of all-powerful and all-knowing services.
Air Layer, Banana and Circumstances
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual survey of the most absurd banking collections, has now decided to announce a competition for “the only absurd order or project from the Master EU”.
"We have been encouraged by this recent event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies," said researcher Patrick Nager.
The recent decision of the European Court of Justice to pool the rate of insurance contributions for men and women has already been made.
Up to now, women have had opportunities for life insurance because insurance companies are at a lower risk.
"More incredible ideas from the Master's EU can be brought to competition by the end of this year.
Only the vote will take place by the end of February 2013," Nager said.
The EU's contested orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, resulting in damage to nature, as well as the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury gradients only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of chicken cells, which has made the eggs significantly travel this year.
It was also criticised for the actual ban on the use of the term "buterboard oil" or the removal from the sale of classical lamps.
Quality bananas shall be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under pressure of a trade or industrial lobby whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or a group of States (the Czech Republic is now even under threat of veto to the requirements of its banks).
The interests of the lobbying are: for example, the top quality bananas in the European Union should have reached a length of 14 cm and should not be “anomalous charge”.
However, the European Commission was justified in harmonizing only the existing different national rules that made trade difficult.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, has nevertheless eased the standards for fruit and vegetables, recalling that existing directives will lead to product dispersal.
The candidate for a victory in the survey may also become a more recent EU decision that the air-sellers must be provided with a warning that children under eight years of age cannot push them without adult care.
The EU has referred to American studies that indicate that the air bubbles in the game are a potential cause of children's death by drowning.
Such a restriction is now extended to children under 14 years of age who are prohibited from smoking in yellowish dunes.
Fun ideas are born at home
It is quite absurd and the rule concerning the European officials themselves: everyone who holds an official position in the EU cannot, given the delicacy of the subject for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, and should instead speak "BURM" (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com portal, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists, Laissez Faire, proposed a vote, in addition to several of the above-mentioned absurd rules, such as the EU rule on the amount of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has established the maximum quantity of food stocks that may be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the Eurosonian Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the levels of preserved mushrooms, which threatened the high fine.
The questionnaire organizers were also interested in paying some countries for their absence from the sea and the idea of granting subsidies to the grant application.
But these ideas came up in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We're in a bad position because we don't have a sea.
Let's ask the European Union for compensation," said Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he indicated that there was a high crop in the country, and as a result of so-called intervention procurement, the State had full stockpiles that had to be exported.
Because the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission has visited the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies to receive the grant were proposed by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Paul Nemce (US-DEU), in particular, such grants should have been made for a grant from Brussels.
EU: Amazing orders are an exception
While the decisions in Member States are easily criticised, the EU's regulatory efforts, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the Euro Union, in the opinion of many experts, deserve greater recognition.
The serious problem, experts believe, is to extend EU grants to projects that do not even have an interest in something common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have achieved when discussing the budget.
Emotions among Czechs and that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this context.
Although six years after the battles with Germans and Austrians kept the name "Olomowic raws", but "Tuzeme Roman", whose traditions in our country were rooted in the 19th century, our producers had to be renamed "Tuzek".
The name of the rom can only be derived from the triangular distillate, not from the sugarcane.
In the official list of EU registered products, along with world-famous "fat" and "gondzola", a marzipan from the German Lübeck or Parma vetch, for example, carlovar sugars, peas and peaches and jasmines have already been found.
The EU's trade mark can also be proud of the pardubic pen and the bitter tube.
People want me to keep a republic, but I'm a lover, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man get into the head of the president's office?
I don't think I'm going to be a senator or president myself.
If we had all worked out in the country, I wouldn't have been anywhere.
But I can't see how the country has been developing in the last 20 years, how the war is going, people are increasing taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I have been forty years old and I am an independent person who is not a party, I have no other way to influence things than to be a senator or president.
You fell into the Senate, but you were soon sent to the presidential castle.
Will you not then turn your backs on the people who have chosen you?
I have always said that I will be involved in the fight for the presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I made it clear that if I was elected as a senator, I would join the presidents.
My goal is not a post, it is a tool I can use to carry out my views.
That is why I need the most influence and the most extensive powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we're a nation in a bar or a TV, but we're willing to drown anyone who's trying to change something.
This is added to the media that black people and that distort freedom of speech with the freedom of the lie.
For example, I was told that I was giving a reception to journalists, or that I was a adviser to Irish Paraubek.
Let's go to your views.
You began the fight for the Presidential Castle with statements on the material and criminal liability of politicians and on the return of property declarations of more than twenty million.
In order to do so, it is necessary to amend the law.
You have no such authority as president, and only a whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to meet this challenge?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed for excursions to become a free enterprise, it was able to move forward.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good offer to the left or to the right, he is deliberately obstructed, and this hinders citizens.
As an independent single person, I have far greater potential for support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country and apply it without having to look at the dogmas.
Do you consider yourself to be more concerned with the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I think people are more likely to treat me as left-handed.
It doesn't matter to me, a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not about someone being right, it's about someone being left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good solution for society, whether it will be proposed by the CPCM or the GDP, and I will be against the wrong idea.
You're angry when someone says you're popular.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
It can be called populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already working in the world, or they are spoken by prominent experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll be left with nothing but slogans.
And that's why you won't be in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to fulfill a criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have any other options.
Only convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to turn them on their own, so that we can achieve our own.
If I had been elected president, it would not have been a problem to organize a direct television broadcast, in which I would appeal to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, public servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to report why they do not wish to do so.
If there is a strong personality that sounds abusive, there will be pressure on the political scene.
Take the President's direct election - it was a public pressure.
I'm just saying that I'm a lover, not a genius, not an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies to stand up for my beliefs and views.
I am only beginning in politics, and for my programme I am trying to get the support of the majority.
I am trying to move on on my own; in case this fails, I will end up in six years and return to the private sector.
This part of it sounds like Okamura's supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that I'm not doing anything by myself, so I visited a number of well-known people with a proposal to join the Senate.
I went to Radi Janchure, he refused much work.
I also at least supported the leading investigation by journalist Jan Laurentzov, who exposed fraud with light fuel products.
I put out my candidacy because people are really unhappy, but now I feel weighed.
Sixty per cent of the people did not go to the elections, but the majority of those who went to have elected representatives of the institution.
Only two of us are independent in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that changes will be made with difficulty.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
You're thinking about the basis of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the purity of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money.
There's no money on the presidential campaign, only twenty thousand crowns on my transparent account.
You don't have the money?
You're talking about property declarations, and how are your own business doing that?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a site in Prague worth about 25 million, a 10 million apartment, another 8 million apartment, an art collection of about 10 million, Aston Martin at 3.5 million, and Skoda Superb at a million, well, and a few million more on account.
As Aston-Martin came to me because it was my little dream - I always liked James Bond who rode in the car, was gallant with women, and at the same time fought against subjugation and lawlessness.
You're driving to Aston Martin, you own 60 million property, and you don't have any money on the campaign?
You're saying you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I've put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for a pre-election campaign from my carnival.
The campaign costs me, in fact, will cover the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't live on that money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't be anywhere else.
So, you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Did you not say that you would reduce this activity?
But it doesn't depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, the director of the tourism agency will be my deputy.
People would like me to be an unscrupulous man who will keep the Republic.
But I also need to live for something.
How much, as an entrepreneur, do you get used to it every month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, that's what I get.
And if I were to be president, I would end my business.
You'll find a full interview on Saturday's issue of the "Right."
MVRDV architects prove that the present adventures are not only in the imagination - for example, Speikenis and his recently built Book Mountain - 2 photographs
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, and finally we can see something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in the close proximity of a large company, says, "No, it's a really beautiful building."
But I wonder, why do we have another library today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
Now no one is volunteering in such old - fashioned libraries, right?
Speikenis, a small, sleepy town under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this deplorable situation a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to common education and build seven coined bridges, which are represented in euro banknotes, in the form of beautifully decorated iron concrete miniatures.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city’s fathers realized that they had the only opportunity to resist the statistics: to build a library here!
The wines of Maas from the rotterdam Architectural Office of MVRDV, the master of bold columning diagrams and the author of sharp, sometimes even cynic constructions, dealt with the challenge of their usual impatience and appeared at a competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under the mouse and perch on the face.
And while the jury's members looked over and rubbed their shoulders, the tough Maas made out of his original pyramid gift of size and ended up defending his project with the following words: "Regarded villages!"
That's my proposal: "The Book Mountain" in Spain, so called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain amounted to 30 million euros.
It is part of the project of revitalization, which also includes a underground garage, supermarket, mail and several housing houses and tunnels of a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the book Mountain was marked by the second award of the 2012 Lucche Library of the Netherlands.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch National Forests Competition.
Thus, the unique landscape that had previously been able to offer nothing but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a wonderfully unpretentious rat, whose white façades led to the idea of a milk factory, was richer than the modern construction of the architecture.
But the main thing is that in Speikenis there was the first public cultural destination building in the history of this city.
A Long Way to a Book
First impression: a book Eldorado under a cheese cup.
There is only one elevator in the center of the mountain mass, for the present architects of architecture and reading would prefer to explore this location by foot.
From all sides, the room is bright and easy to see, the fields of the worshiped rags and elegant street banners create a sense of public urban space.
The city environment is perfectly restored.
Looking around is looking for a rock, a dog and a football boy and a girl.
And everywhere there are books, books, books.
"The book crews usually stand along the facades, and there is a large dark hall in the middle, usually inconvenient and indisposed," says Vinny Maas.
We put a classic configuration of the space from the foot to the head and pulled out the area for reading inside the outside.
The interior area of the bookstore has been well used: the centre has offices, Internet libraries, chess clubs, environmental centres and technical facilities.
In particular, the black bookmakers who serve as the wall section, the parapets, and the lattice pearls are delighted.
Their kind, texture and smell are unusual.
Even experienced architects and construction engineers are lost in suspicion that it is an unknown material.
"We tried to work with secondary materials," explains Jop Trauborst, the project manager representing the Speikenis community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once on a farm in Frisland, we met the right side product of agriculture.
For many years in carpets and fields in the Netherlands, the artificial fibre material of a millimetres thickness has been used as a base under the roots.
It's cheap and saves time.
A thin textile serves one or two seasons, then it can be removed.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time - was printed in four centimeters thick panel.
Under the heat and pressure of the so-called ‘Landbaauplastik’ (CLP), it is transformed into a dark, uniform, durable material, with the smell of a little new car and a little cross-section.
There are 105 degrees at the top.
A person who survives a distance of almost 500 metres will be rewarded in a literary coffee not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and wooden figurines in the woods.
They are concerned about the atmosphere, and above all about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Costs per New Soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model environmental project," Trouborst says.
The heat of the ground is used for heating and cooling.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass cup, even in bright days the sun falls just a short time inside.
Widely wooded farms, which are perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and take on most of the sunbeds.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the belts are fully automatic.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verhaig was here, too.
And also a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "the soul of Speikenis, which has long been missing."
Reason: Within a few weeks of the opening, each person received an invitation to offer a book from his own congregation.
These books were to be held empty places on the poles, not yet fully equipped library, at the time there were 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The poles are placed to the top.
"There's nothing worse than a semi-published library," says architect Vinny Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, every resident now somehow relates to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV has been able to solve a royal task, which is called the creation of identity in the professional jargon.
Speikenis wrote his literary story.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for the identity building.
Sabo: "Germans should play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, an expert on the relationship between the United States and Europe, Berlin thus balances on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first realized that it was voting against the Palestinians' request for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stefan Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be cautious about its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that she does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, but it was not too critical of Israel.
During the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the introduction of a restricted zone for flights.
As a result, NATO has made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The matter is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, and that is to say, it is from a policy that has been managed by the United States to its own German foreign policy.
The additional situation is complicated by the lack of a coherent single policy for Europeans.
Thus, the Germans are again placed between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just pushing their role, but they're on their way to "more normal" foreign policy.
Such an external policy carried out by France or the United Kingdom.
What, specifically, does "normal" foreign policy mean in German terms?
It is a willingness to take a position that is not dependent on the position of the United States or European partners in their national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests differ significantly from those of other major States, and Germany should therefore protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Persian Gulf States.
It should therefore be cautious not to offend the public and the elite in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its part.
But I wouldn't give that too much importance, it's not a completely unilateral relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Did Germany harm its relations with the United States by abstaining from important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, the understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don't think it was the same dramatic blow as in the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
This indicates that it should be taken seriously as a game on the international stage and that its interests should be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States of America, on the other hand, has made a clear statement about the veto.
Is there a distinction between the US and many European States?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government in the depths of the soul has sufficient understanding of the European position.
But, of course, with regard to the local political situation, the Government cannot take such a position openly.
I believe that significant differences in opinion are not as significant as they always appear.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, note that Obama is not at all in the rush of Netanyahu's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the situation of an important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for Germans.
Of course, Germans would be slightly simpler if there were a single, non-controversial European policy, but that is not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and are forced to act instead, based only on their own vision.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that Germany will play a leading role in developing a common European position in the future.
It is understandable that it is not easy for Germany to do so, even if it is because of its relations with Israel.
This subject has always been touching.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international game, will it not really take on the role of itself?
Or does Germany still have a heavy role to play?
Germany has not been used to this, and it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Let us consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany plays an important role, the most diverse anti-German feelings are expressed.
The Germans aren't just dealing with it.
Actually, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It must take into account the different neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Thus, the impact of the United States on European policies is constantly weakening, but at this point the EU does not fill this vacuum, but who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
Even if you do not like it, it makes you feel uncomfortable or makes you feel unloved.

"Protection of trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous trade mark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a very officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from which it is established.
However, it will be protected until the holders of the original names have made a claim.
But it is not clear if they will be able to defend their rights.
"Alternatives are becoming increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violations of the right to trademarks in the Far East.
On my desk every week, there's a new case of this kind.
Imitators are sufficient to add a few letters to enable them to record their trade marks.
This is how Lu-Gucci gets from Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German companies are legally copied, such as the Puma sports product manufacturer.
The patch opens a folder with records of the registration of trademarks in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trade mark, which also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese are champions of the world for copying and violating intellectual property rights.
In large cities there are multi-faceted universities that sell almost exclusively subcontracts.
However, Patloch's case is not the case, and according to his trustees, he advocates that Chinese companies be given the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere from the registration of trademarks.
The Chinese call it the ban minipai, the brand-passer.
This word is associated with the "dakuan ban".
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not acknowledge their guilt
"It harms the business, it has to be fought," Patloch is convinced.
"The trade mark is missing, the unique situation is lost, the image is very much in pain."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected sectors are estimated by millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China sells 15 billion euros a year, the third in size and the fastest growing market for the sale of luxury items.
However, it is difficult to remove the questionable entries in the trade mark register, and it is worth it.
The process may take up to nine years, with a unclear outcome.
The record tells of cases in which the court dismissed the case, since after a long period of time the contested title became "the real market".
If the claimant fails, he will even have to pay the plagiarism, as he has damaged his trade mark in China, says Patloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had a court dispute with the manufacturer of Sany’s construction machines, an enterprise that had recently acquired a Putzmeister concrete manufacturer.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the Mercedes star emblem.
The buying Volvo Geely originally used the blue and white logo that BMW remembered; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The fashion product manufacturer Lacoste lost China's copyists from Hong Kong and Singapore, where the famous crocodile looked on the other side.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.
The TCMO trade mark registration in Beijing confirms that in 2010 there were difficulties due to the lack of staff and equipment.
But last year there was a "return from the emergency to the normal process".
Thus, the number of unprocessed cases on objections was reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
At least 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
It's worth fighting against.
As often as in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million trade marks protection applications were made by CTMO, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China has launched a list of new registrations throughout the world on the tenth occasion, reports the department.
The same applies to the total number of actual trade marks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan fees were paid.
To simplify, this means that each registration is worth an average of 1280 yuan or EUR 160.
It's worth a lot more, according to the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the concerts have been fighting against the Chinese plagiarism.
The Germans were able to find that the illegal production of their sub-car details had been eliminated.
However, the simulator secured Chinese rights for the Freudenberg trade mark.
This was its own loss, as the Germans are not protected, says Hanno Ventcler, President of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO trade mark registration agency rejected the Munich claim.
True, in both of the following instances Freudenberg has won, but the opposing side continues to fight so far.
There's gotta be a start.
The issue is now before the Supreme Court.
Ventcler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money, and nerves."
The internal costs were hardly taken into account, and the company's archive had to examine even centuries-old acts to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully proposed to the opposing party "a large six-digit amount in the euro" for a settlement.
"It's clear how much it's worth to us," says Ventcler.
The dangers of the Far East are threatened even in Europe.
This is where the simulators record unprotected trade marks.
Yes, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The concert had long ceased production in these areas, but it was able to prevent registration.
"There's got to be a start," says Ventchler.
Both he and Patloch's lawyer recommend that German companies be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions on the protection of trademarks, and foreigners should rather “all that is to be protected, also registered in China”, says Ventcler.
Otherwise, it could be much more valuable than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his drama on the trade mark, he will have to pay the opposite party for his own name, explains Ventcler.
Otherwise, they're pulling us out of the market in a disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: Flooding, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, Imbongi chorus, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy to do so.
The history of relationships over a distance of more than 8733 kilometres.
The first is that cowboy shoes, basketball shirts, ladies' jackets and men's jackets are picking up a tat on the park floor and they're quick to find it.
Two-three-four.
Only after that will the voices of the singers grow slowly - alth, bass, tenor and soprano - they come up, wonder, and follow each other.
And Pete Hopf, a 29-year-old driver, doesn't jump out of his mother's shoes when he carries them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberge chorus, Imbongi repeats a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age, from human genetic experts to court, were present.
"Om "Obani" is a simple thing, every voice of people has their own text, and in a completely foreign language: Zulu, where 11 million people speak in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Self - Help
According to the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are approximately 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS orphans live.
More than 40 per cent of the population are HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitheni, the Association of Voices for Africa found leaders in Germany.
70 attended the school for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take charge.
It guarantees children money for school, school and daily hot meals in the Gogo Centre.
Imbongi in Zulu means a storyteller or an admirer.
There's no running around in this room, so they can sing.
Almost ten years ago, chorus explores songs in this foreign soft language, and from time to time he even brings them back to where they first appeared: in South Africa.
Because at 8733 km of the summer from Heidelberg, in the north-west of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitheni, which depends on the voices of the German people.
Forty per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people, some of whom have lived in simple clay and straw houses, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of the HI virus.
In Estonia, the disease of all Swaziland is reflected in the mine: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest expected life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF data.
The cut-off in men, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, has almost not been accepted among the population.
More than forty per cent of the population of Swaziland have a virus of immunodeficiency, death in the middle of the fourth decade is not rare.
Hor opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before that, Imbogni saw a number of children on the streets who were not only concerned with parental care, but also simply: food, clothing, education.
Without school education, people in a poor country have no chance at all.
At first, it was a private obligation of individual participants to send the child to school for several euros a year and allow him to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded a "Voices for Africa" association, which since then has been very professional in dealing with AIDS orphans in Estonia.
Facts of sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important diseases transmitted by sex?
Bacterial IPPs include syphilis, chlamidiosis and tripper (gonorrhea).
HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, and hepatitis are common viral HPVs.
Lobic pedicules and particles are part of a parasitic PPP.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly seen in men who engage in sex with men.
Robert Koha is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilis registered in Germany are transmitted as a result of sexual contacts between men.
Heterogeneous adults often experience sexually transmitted diseases include Chlamydia infections, trichomonosis, candidiasis, gonorrhea, and human papilloma virus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections are present in this group.
Among young people, Chlamydia infections are significantly more frequent than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
We also have a human papilloma virus that is common among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory registration.
Syphilis disease, according to Robert Koh Institute, doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
It's about one tenth less than last year.
What are some symptoms of venous disease?
Infectious diseases, genitalia, wet rash, vomiting, lower abdominal pain, as well as mucous membranes or emulsions may occur.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain undetected.
How can we protect ourselves?
Preservatives are able to reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide a percentage protection.
In part, sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact infection and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend a regular survey, especially when sexual partners are frequently switched.
In early diagnosis, the majority of PPPs can be cured and the remote effects avoided.
The chief, the donations, and not least the honours of people throughout Germany, are able to collect something.
"We have all sent about €200,000 to Estonia," said Annene Lennartz, president of the Association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is available to the Dlaminas, a conscious and active woman.
She is also concerned that orphans are well-equipped, for example, in one of the grandparents.
Gogos, as they call Zulu's old women, is the village's resistance.
Some of them took up to 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and took care that the children would appear in the classroom every day.
Those who do not have a family come to the home of Hanisil, a single woman who receives a salary from the union, as well as two riots that each day prepare for over 200 hungry children.
In addition, the "Voices for Africa" association organized a Swiss school, built two smokers, and organized a HIV analysis for many village residents, along with the American health organization PSI.
It is difficult to imagine, but the disease that is so evident throughout the country prefers to remain silent deeply.
King with 14 women
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Anne Lennartz, "because it's related to sexuality."
It is quite unusual for a country in which the King has 14 women.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Msati III, is known for his love for the remains.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, the lifestyle of such an authorized State is also responsible for the spread of the HIV virus so rapidly over the past years.
But it's also on shipworkers who blow up the virus in the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they're almost out of use.
Another culture is the flesh."
In order to support a little cultural exchange, the Ibmogni chorus every two or three years travel south Africa and sing songs, chests, military spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many in the southern side of the Black continent have known since apartheid.
The bus, full of white people singing songs in the black language, is not only a recognition of good mood and joy, but it has even caused tears in the eyes of heavy borderers.
A visit is always made to Estonia, where singers visit underprivileged children.
Despite the fact that a small village with difficulty can be found on the map, it is more well known in the Eculven Valley.
"Go to Estonia, there's a light," people say.
And after a 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the warm singers return to the Rehabilitation Hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is burning here too.
Messenger: NASA opens ice in Mercury
The Messenger's son found evidence that there's ice on the planet of Mercury.
The ice cover may have a thickness of up to 20 metres.
The United States Space Agency has proved that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as appears in the three studies published in the special journal Science.
Zand "Messenger" has found evidence that the ever-lasting region of the planet is covered by ice.
Its thickness shall be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 metres.
It is likely that the water comes from a comet or perhaps an asteroid that hit Mercury.
No one connects the opening of ice with the existence of life on the planet, says Scientific Director Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these openings could help explain how the water and other building elements of life had fallen elsewhere in the solar system.
For the inhabitants of the Earth, the intelligence, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, are studying the depths of the Universe.
From time to time, they send pictures to Earth: little circles into endless valleys.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Plank Institute.
The eighth planet of our solar system, as well as the Carlic planet of Cerer.
As with Pluto, who is addressing the Sun for Neptune, Cere, as a new definition of the international astronomical union of 2006, is not “planned”.
This fragment of the "Spitzer" telescope is the "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue points, it's harder to identify the pink "new" stars in the star circle.
This region of star formation - scientists call it W5 unromantically - is an open telescope "Spitzer" in the constellation Cassiopea, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This translucent fire of a dying star photographed the NASA Telescope "Spitzer".
It looks like a ring is made of material that the star released in the process of dying.
In the giant fog of Trifid, which has been removed for 5400 light years from the Earth, new stars and dust are emerging.
NASA Telescope "Spitzer" took this photo of the Galactic Home Hall.
The constellation Pleiade, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night by unarmed eyes.
Of course, the color telescope gets better.
As a red eye, the observer's misconception of the Street on this infrared picture is muzzled.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation of Water.
The Earth's similarity to the continent has brought about this misconception by the name of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photos provides an expressive coloring.
This new star, in all its beauty, was photographed only with the help of infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his ring: How did they come up is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Maybe it's a satellite moon scan, which has been missing 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and clearest photos of the Hubble telescope: the Waterworth galaxy
Depending on the colouring of the images of the spiral galaxies, they are transformed into the present production of art.
The photograph published by the European South Observatory shows Trifid's misconception in the starry of the Shooter for several thousand light years.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (triangular, triangular), since the dark poles of dust are divided into three parts of the broken heart of the star.
In the constellation, astronomers photographed a preface of space collision: 400 million light-years away from the Earth of the two floating galaxies meet one another and inevitably meet each other.
This was the birth of the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
A person who does not like technical reductions may call it the Southern Cycling.
The photograph of the space telescope "Habble" shows Iris' fog fragment in Cefe's star.
The fog removed for 1400 light years consists of dust particles of between 10 and 100 times the size of the usual domestic dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, which is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
Most spiral galaxies are called UGC 1810.
There is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star bell always creates new stars.
This star cloud associated with Rosetka's blindness is also constantly creating new stars - within 5,000 light years of the Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, only gas has not been washed.
Researchers suggest that it occurred shortly before the Great Explosion, when the universe was essentially hydrogen.
Our Views in the Universe — The Key Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented by Hans Lippersgeem in 1608, even before Galileo began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, optical telescopes have become more and more accessible to space.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar observatory under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror shown here was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, U.S.A., it's set up a "Large Binocular Telescope."
It allows you to see space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
"Gran Telescopio Canarias" has a giant internal device - the diameter of only one mirror is 10.4 metres.
The "Great South African Telescope" in South Africa is segmented to reduce the value.
However, in diameter it reaches about 11 meters.
Lack of low-cost structural performance: the telescope is firmly anchored under a vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobbi-Eberley Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its speciality: high light-collection capacity.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the largest world telescopes.
Researchers are listening to extraterrestrial signals in space using a radio telescope in Aresíbo, Puerto Rico.
Radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
Participating in the "Exterior Mind Search" project (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing its computing power.
Type of European Astronomical Service (ESO) observatory in the Andes of Chile.
There's "A Big Telescope" here, which is entirely in line with its name.
Its four mirrors allow for the display of even the average infrared spectrum.
The Chilean ESO Observatory also plans to establish a European Large Telescope Assessment.
Its main mirror must be broken down by a total of 42 metres and will be made up of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photographs should be expected not before 2018.
By 2007, both Kek telescopes on the Hawaii volcano, Mauna Kea, were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors of ten metres in diameter.
Kek Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which is also seen in the sky with the help of Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, there must be a new giant telescope in Mauna Kea, with a diameter of 30 metres.
They can love illustrations here.
However, the most important species in space is provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has provided pictures of far-reaching worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, especially where life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the beginning of the mission.
The photos feature the latest preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webba Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space not earlier than 2018 on board the Arian 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the Great Explosion in the world of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest that Mercury has ice on the southern shelf.
However, there is no reliable data on this, since "Messenger" is returning closer to the North Pole of the planet.
Radar measurements over decades indicated that there was ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the wisdom of "Messenger" launched in 2004, the first to come back to Mercury, scientists are now convinced of this.
Eat butter every day - and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a more Biblical age.
There's even a museum here for a long time.
A search for a puzzle in a country where 97-year-olds seem to be still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a more Biblical age.
There's even a museum here for a long time.
A search for a puzzle in a country where 97-year-olds seem to be still relatively young.
A trip through the Tales Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The minibus with a thunderstorm is on the high road beyond the thick woods of hills, stormy hills, and simple Christian homes.
It's so green and it's bright to think you're in Schwarzwalde.
But it's the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian border is only a few miles away.
These are the people of the towns, some of the people of the Caucasians, who know little, but they speak beautiful things in the Persians and the Azerbaijani, and they are distinguished for a long time.
The final item is Lerick.
The small town is built by too heavy architecture of Soviet times, which does not at all harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are not coming here, the road from Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tired.
It's eight hours away, because the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the Caspian Sea is here in the province until it is well.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) is convinced that there is nothing to interest tourists.
"In May Baku was celebrated by the Eurovision Festival - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulaeva said.
She's the director of a long-standing museum, probably the only one in the world.
There are approximately eight dozen of these places, over 100 years of age. Fatulaeva points to black and white photography.
It's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child
But the controversial museum is the head of the Shirali Muslims, which was probably 168 years old.
The evidence of birth, however, is not.
In view of the fact that the older person, whose age is confirmed by the documents, was 122 years old, Muslim age seems to be extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaeva.
The man had been married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136, he was probably born a daughter.
So did the Muslim chaplain add a few decades to his age?
Even Rembrandt Shollz, a senior researcher at the Max Plank Institute in Rostok, heard of debtors in Central Asia.
"Many people of overage age can also meet in some areas of China, Japan or the Huns Valley in Pakistan," Shollz says, "there are also very many very old people living in Sardinia."
However, because of the lack of documents, it is impossible to confirm age because there were no civil status registers.
Every day a glass of hot butter
Nevertheless, the fact that people in the area of Leric have become more and more old - fashioned in Bible times.
20 people over 100 years of age are now living here.
Why are there so many people in the south?
The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimdade explains this by a special gene.
The director of the Fatulaeva Museum, on the other hand, believes it's a matter of nutrition.
Fats love meat, bread, and most dairy products, many of them drink on a hot butter bottle every day, but if such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or in the first form of life that keeps people young? In Chengemeon, a small village near the town of Leric, Rubab Mirzoev lives.
At 97 years of age, she was still relatively young for these spreads.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a bottle of butter that doesn't stand there.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of Mirza's sons and daughter, who have long had their grandchildren.
Two little ones will jump in the vicinity too.
In the kitchen, guests are prepared to make tea, which is supplied in typical strawberry jars.
In Mirza's ideally level and strong white teeth, under the main plate it removes the long dark-Russian hairs that her son proudly exposes before us.
I'm always my hair with milk, so they've never come out and kept the color.
"And I've never used shampoo," says Mirzaeva.
The monthly pension is sufficient for life
She always came only what grew in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, beans.
For the rest of my life, I never bought any products at the store.
Then she tells of her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest was after World War II.
But it's better when "loving father" Geedar Aliev got up in the role.
Propaganda does not often sound like an old woman.
However, the culture created around the figure of the nation ' s father, who ruled as dictator, in Azerbaijan is virtually unknown.
He was in power before 2003, and then his son, Ilham, was in power.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among Azerbaijani elders.
Mirzaeva receives 230 manats (approximately the same amount of euro) as a monthly pension, for local conditions, the amount to which you can live well.
And perhaps the long-standing son of Mirza's right: "The old people in our culture are being treated with deep respect."
They live in a large family of loved ones, surrounded by caring and happy people.
No reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Contestant demonstrations in Cairo indicate a deep gap in the country.
The future Shariate-based constitution has met with fierce resistance.
The Egyptian President did not gather for the Paphos.
We need to create a transition.
"And his success rests on my responsibility to the people and to the God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but primarily to Christian graves, liberals, educated Muslims, and non - religious Egyptians.
Indeed, all of them, who have so far been hopelessly exposed to a disunity, are afraid.
Fear of a religious State in the Nile for the mercy of the powerful Muslim brothers.
Mohammed Mursy, if you don't excuse me, said he temporarily cut down the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his jurisdiction to "to save the revolution."
However, the fact is that the 61-year-old engineer with the degree of a doctor at the University of South California in the United States is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the whole world.
Will the judiciary be powerless?
In fact, 234 articles have been able to extend to a 15-hour walk at night with obstacles to the Islamic constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is a part of the fear.
As in the previous constitutions, the draft stated that the case law was based on the “principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and remains a case of interpretation, and it could be feared that Islamists would use the vague language and the resulting legal ceiling for a more strict interpretation of the Shariah.
At least one new article is included: in all matters relating to the Sharia, Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country, which enjoys great authority throughout Sunni Islam, should be brought to the Council.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy are monitoring legislation, that de facto would result in a limitation of the judiciary.
In the draft Constitution, much is the subject of interpretation
Another problem: Civilians must remain liable to the military court.
These courts served during the period of Mubaraka's power to oppress the opponents.
There were up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
Also, as stated in the draft, the State must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “support its morals and values”.
Legally, this is so vague that public institutions will be able to control even the content of cinema and literature through this article.
The open text does not mean anything like censorship.
In fact, no article establishes direct equality between men and women.
Therefor the other was forbidden that they should be reviled, and that they should not disobey the apostle Muhammad and his apostles.
But what such insults and how they should be punished remains unclear.
It is also questionable to say that it is prohibited to “suffer people”.
Will there be enough cartoons on the president or jokes about the law?
The question of interpretation, as well as many in this project, which Morris proposes for signature and which, he said, will be presented to the Egyptians at a referendum.
"Revolution has returned"
A few weeks have passed since opposition to the superiority of Islamists was formed.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual loneliness on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document even before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, taking third place in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Prize for Peace and the former head of the International Atomic Energy Authority, Mohammed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution was “a waste of history”.
Because of the short news service Twitter he accused Mursy's undertakers of wanting to lead the "way against democracy".
"If he announces the referendum, we'll go to his court and take it off," said opposition Jasser Said.
"We have not stood up yet, our brothers' blood has not yet been avenged," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition policy of Haled Ali.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for a counter-demonstration, but, with caution, not in Tahrir Square, but after the mass prayer on the other shore of the Nile before the University of Cairo.
It was attended by a large number of women under the roofs of the Salafites, who shouted: “The people require the application of God’s law.”
They demanded from Murcy, "Clean the country," and they swore, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic place at which it all began sparked the state of practical civil war.
The Mursi followers obviously did not want to take that risk.
The Muslim brothers stated that both the opponents and the supporters of the draft constitution had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide in the electoral era where the country should go.
Most of the Islamic project is considered to be a decisive case.
"The notion of "human rights" is not mentioned at all"
Hafiz Abu Saeda was angry with this forced constitutional process, which had to last until February with the participation of all the public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOPR) protected the Muslim Brotherhood when they were sitting in or before the court in Mubaraka.
Not because he has divided their vision of peace, but because human rights are inseparable to him.
That's why he was killed, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in a conversation with "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Mursie's influence on all three branches of government in the State disappoints a lawyer.
These measures are a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil state, the President de facto cancelled it," said Said.
For democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saida feels that everyone has left him, even an international community that looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be the payout.
A protesters on Tahrir Square warn: "You're creating a monster that you can't control."
Norway's fishing: the world's most foolishly smelling fish?
Norway's five million people have one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Perhaps the secret of the country's success is related to a local passion for one extremely evil fishing habit?
Take a few transparent pieces of cheese.
Put them in a dirty and sweaty sports suit.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll get the wrong smell of cancer, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacys.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but in the air there's an inexhaustible characteristic smell.
Racfisk is a powder, salty and water-flavored for years, depending on what the soul needs to achieve.
As the sorority cools and cools, the Norwegian crowds gather at the Fagernes festival, which is about it, let's say it's a captivating ceremony.
"They eat raw and drink water, a local sinking water," explains Harvard Halvarsen, a local fire department in the profession, and a "racic general" fellowship, which is led by the festival.
We are surrounded by people who eat small pieces of fish and drink it with small portions of alcohol.
"Someone likes aquavite more than a crab," says Harvard.
This drink can break the smell.
I'll try a couple of pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not so bad - it's a little different from the dry portion you've been driving on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a completely different time, a time of poverty, when, before the coldhouses appeared, the fish were stuck in hermetically closed bottles with salty water.
Then a deep winter, when the fish had been well and thoroughly loaded, had been pulled out, and had been absorbed by alcohol, consumed with food.
Remembering the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to migrate mainly to the United States, the past generation still remembers that they had to leave their country.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13 per cent of the immigrants are employed, high wages and a social security system developed.
The people of Sweden (the former rival and not so long and much more used neighbor) are coming to work here.
Raqfisk is considered an important symbol, a constant, even a few evil elements of previous Norway.
It's one of the most expensive local sights.
On the other hand, here all the expensive, small glass of beer or sandwich will be worth 9 pounds of sterling (14 US dollars).
Norway has rarely appeared in world news, and most of the country's inhabitants seem to be doing so.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name Anders Bravik, a racist and extremist right-wing crowd last year who shot and killed 77 men, women and children.
Not to mention his name, the act is called "22 July".
Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peace-loving country, one of their fellow citizens was capable of such crimes and murders.
Norway's current well-being is based on the growth (from the beginning of the seventies) of one of the world's largest oil-gas industries.
"The same oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our officer, who has been involved in the suffering of cancer, a woman with long bright hair and a particularly blue eye, a flood of Nordic well-being.
We are but a people whom you call a people of understanding.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English beautifully.
We don't like showing up, we're not polite.
Norway is very careful about its oil, most of the oil industry's revenues are invested in a special fund established for future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when all the money they had not had, Norway carefully calculated all the costs.
"As long as you can swim on the winter meadows and walk in summer, that's enough for happiness," Anna says.
"And there's a crab," she adds with a jobless smile.
I'm in the snow for some food. I'm sick of a crab.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat, it's just exotic, delicious soda meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for an even greater number of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel, there's a special dinner on the crab, where the voters determine the best or perhaps the most aromatic fish.
There's a direct TV showing the lead in the Grandfather's Galstoke, surrounded by dishes with crabs.
It's like the song competition "Eurovision".
"So, Tor-Urgen, what estimate did you place for the best fish in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling off a chair, maybe by taking over the aquarium.
Maybe it's just by blowing the smell of that fish.
Mexico President Enrique Peña Njote is facing a difficult career start.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Njote, is preparing to enter the post, correspondent BBC Will Grant invites us to look at the challenges he will face and the mixed expectations of the people of his country.
The road movement in Mexico is now particularly crying.
The city was overloaded by transport and in good time, and on Monday, steel fences were brought, which cut several key highways into the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done in order not to allow people to get to work on the prizes, but to prevent protestors from falling into Parliament's building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will make a presidential transfer and take over the country's governance.
There's an uncomplicated task ahead of him.
Mexico has achieved good economic indicators in the administration of Felipe Calderon, which is now in its power, but the country has been in war with drugs, which has already taken about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government tells the people of Mexico that it is prepared to fight violence," Mr. Pinea Njeta told the U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week at the Oval Office of the White House.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Prior to such statements by the President of the United States, the political career of Mr. Penja Njet developed as Governor of his native state of Mexico.
His family, in a densely populated and extensive state surrounding the capital, shared the views of the new leader.
A Straight-line Man
In the idyllic town of Vale de Bravo, for example, they remember it with warmth.
The residents deserve to revitalize tourism, the development of the resort and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new streets built by Mr. Penjene Nyeto, which are quite different from the roads with bombs and baits that were previously in this place.
The tables on its name are dedicated to the modern building of the sports centre and to an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We link with him the hope of real and serious changes," said his friend and political ally, Gabriel Olver Ernandes, a state congressman from the ruling Njena Newt institutional and revolutionary party (PRI).
We look forward to the current and decisive changes that our country so urgently needs, especially in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay of the PRI party, Vicente Fox was forced into 2000.
Congressman Olver admits that after his 12-year absence in the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party has placed great hopes on Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he objected to the inconsistencies which had challenged the new President.
He is very direct and very devoted to the fulfillment of his vision of the future country.
He is an excellent public figure, and above all, a man who can listen.
But in the second part of the state, many people had a different idea of the former governor.
The Municipality of Nesaualkootl, also known as the Ciudad Nes, is the most distinctive contrast with the mighty streets of Vale de Bravo.
Hidden under the estacads of highways, it is, in many ways, the home of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe in this megapolis.
Earlier this year, troops had been drawn to reconcile drug-trafficking gangs in these areas; violence against women was particularly acute.
Several dozens of women killed were found in the desert near the extensive mine in the last two years.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during the reign of Mr. Pinea Nieto, which is much higher than that in the tragicly celebrated violence in the city of Sudad-Huares, which has become a nickname when it comes to the killing of innocent women.
According to opponents, Mr. Penja Nyeto, it was best said that he was unable to deal with the issue of the murder of women during his stay in the Governor ' s office.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of ignoring the problem completely.
The householder of a concrete house, like most of the houses in this obstetric area, Irina Bundiya is hard to stop, showing me pictures of her dead daughter Mariana Luna.
An official version of Mariana killed herself in 2010.
However, her family believed that she had been killed by her tormentor.
"When I got to her house, it seemed as if her body had been washed before," recalls Mrs. Bundy.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body had already been slaughtered.
Mariana’s mother tells the story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where she hangs close to the puzzle on which only one word is drawn: justice.
That is what they said was rejected by this family.
"The state officials treated me like an old gangster, a lack of peacebreaker.
They want people to just accept everything they say and to be small.
But it's wrong, it's not possible, especially when there's so many violations and omissions around it," she says.
Given the President's shift on Saturday, President Penja Njote will take on a difficult responsibility with her.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violence, and the new President has promised to make this issue a priority during his reign.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as the Governor," said Olver, a congressman from Vale de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, that is what the families of the victims in the City of Ness are most concerned about.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about being treated badly, he claims.
The prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's statements on the poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Protection requires closing the case on the grounds that the terms of Manninga ' s detention were cruel.
The U.S. Army is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that a number of Bradley Mannings, who had been charged with the greatest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not take advantage of the many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he said had to be transferred to the military prison.
During a cross-examined pre-trial hearing in Fort Mide, Maryland, the military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said that the weekly visits to Manning by the prison administration for nine months in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of Manning's application for protection on the grounds that the conditions for his arrest were cruel and that he himself had been sufficient to punish had been carried out on the following day, after Manning stated that he was under arrest, he intended to commit suicide.
The military intelligence expert, arrested in June 2010, was accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents during the service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks has not confirmed that the source of information was Manning.
At the hearing on Friday, Prosecutor Fein and Manning examined the reports that had been filled after Manninga's visits to the administration during his visit to Quantico prison, where he was under strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits, the prison officials asked Manningu questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Faine asked on Friday about the reports, Manning admitted that he considered the treatment of the prison administration as “exceeding” and the general conditions of detention as “very professionally organized”.
The reports under consideration did not contain complaints of maltreatment, although Manninga was directly asked about the conditions of its detention, Faine said.
Manning replied that he had voiced concern about these problems and that his representatives had discussed these problems with him and said that they would, but had not fixed it in writing.
"They wrote "no problems" (after my complaints) but that doesn't mean I didn't raise this topic in the conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Deniz Lind, also asked Manninga why he did not complain of mistreating him in January 2011 at a meeting of the commission that he had held in writing several months earlier.
Manning replied that at that meeting he wanted to make it possible to remove the "trafficking prevention" regime and ease the conditions of detention.
Military leaders explained that a limited detention regime, at a lower level than the surveillance regime to prevent suicide, was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I am all right for them to cancel the anti-trafficking regime... to improve my standard of living from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified for his arrest in Iraq and for his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before he was transferred to a military base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that thoughts of suicide had appeared to him in Kuwait, and that he once lost consciousness because of a severe fire.
He explained that psychologically difficult when you are not allowed to know how your participation is going and what is going on in the outside world.
"My world complains to the Camp-Ariffan base, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I'd die in this cell."
In Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small camera at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours in the day, in complete isolation.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only the mattress, clothes, socks, a few items of clothing and glasses.
He says that he was trying to move, as sleeping or even lying on a daily basis prohibited the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he had a constant light that penetrated the outside of the camera.
If the guards didn't see him when he was turning into a bed at night, they would wake him up and force him to turn back.
Lawyer Manning made a formal objection to the abuse of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manninga was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made on Thursday that after one night he was forced to sleep in his room in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners in the morning check.
Manning stated that he could not cover his clothes during the check.
In answer to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he should throw out the clothes that he could cover, but admitted that no one had ordered him to throw it directly.
On Thursday, Manning said that the night before, he was forced to sleep naked because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could use a shirt of rabbits or monkeys to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning, his lower whites, the monkeys, and the eyes were taken from the camera.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had to survive at the time of the detention and would significantly reduce the term of detention if Manning was recognized as guilty by the military court, which had to begin its trial at the beginning of next year.
The defence stated that it was planning to invite Manning to admit guilt for less serious crimes and other charges to challenge as excessive.
Resumption of the hearings was planned for these outcome, and it was expected that the accused party would insist that conditions of detention had been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the content of arrests under the strictest regime.
Among the charges brought by Manningu are the sponsorship of the opponent, the illicit promotion of Internet disclosure, the transmission of national defence information, and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he may be threatened with life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of the American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunity to realize themselves.
Mexicans are inclined to blame those who have left because they remind the people of the difficult times in the country.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are breaking up between two cultures.
During my recent trip to Mexico, I traveled on a corridor for the arrivals, approached the border control area and stopped at the site.
The signs were indicated in two rows: one for Mexicans, the other for Foreigners.
I've been standing in front of them for a few seconds, I don't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life was called a Mexican.
It's just a conditional name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York consider themselves Italian.
Later, I stopped at the complex "American of Mexican origin".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's family, there was no need for conditional names or complex structures.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than those with a language, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport, and I became special to Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda was typical for the meetings of the presidents of those countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Njota spoke freely about the rise of the Mexican economy, which would enable Mexicans to remain in Mexico now, with the same success, instead of moving to the United States.
He wanted to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a kind of North American trade bloc like the Euro Union.
In addition, President Peña Njota promised to continue the war against drug addicts in Mexico, but no specific proposals had been made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a serious and ongoing challenge.
Most Americans had never thought that in 1848 the United States had invaded Mexico and had forced its leaders to give up half their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not for minutes, and they see memories of those events everywhere.
Therefore, it is only up to any U.S. government official to complain, even though the word of criticism is being made against Mexico, the press and the elite of the Mexican society are complaining about the fact that Americans are reaching out for the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the Montesuma descendants are filled with war.
Mexico's relations with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States are the most complex.
Would you like to talk about the funeral?
That's enough.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who are in that country for themselves and those who are not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican origin were only one reason: at some point in their family history, someone - father or grandfather - had no opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and had to go north.
Most of the time, they were Mexicans of a certain type — smug, poorly educated, poor Christian families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
In Mexico they see it differently.
Today, our life is the fulfillment of an American dream, we've learned in good schools, and we've got good jobs, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider as its own.
United States of America.
We also know that most of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer them the same way.
They remind us of humiliating defeats, and they refer to us as people of the second kind, as unscrupulous Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish enough, and our relationship with Mexico is not strong enough.
Only our existence is due to failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We would not now be following a seductive lust, finding a real life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalahare and was legally transferred to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain exercises between Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin, Mexicans who clearly understand their national identity and Americans of Mexican origin, and this is offensive.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my well-known Mexican Americans do not feel belonging to any of them.
We're listening to the Mexican group Los Tigers del Norte, but we love Bruce Springstine.
Getting the best out of the two worlds, you're definitely losing the roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my visit, as if our relations were not sufficiently complicated, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals wanted to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work with Mexico's ambassadors and represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how much to visit it, and could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
There's nothing going to happen.
Too many attempts in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not see this country as beautiful.
I'm sorry, but get this straight, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States, they will also have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican origin are still in a position to blame for how their relatives in Mexico had been treated recently.
Yes, it is.
Please, we're more common than I thought.
Old Battles in the New Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas group could become a fragile foundation for further peace
Can the long - term peace between the Arabs and the Israelis in the Middle East be achieved?
A major round of bloodshed is the conclusion that such hopes are in vain.
There were regular, meaningless disputes about who the first was; many buildings were turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians and six Israelis, were killed; for the first time during the conflict released from the Gaza Strip, rockets fell into the vicinity of the capital of Israel Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the hopelessness of the Israelis and the Palestinians in their everlasting conflict, the changes had taken place in the Middle East.
This may be different, but the events of the Arab Spring have surrounded many of the established realities in the mass storm, and the Palestinians with the Israelis have not been able to stay on the side of the strike that is shaking the region.
Their fight may result in even more bloodshed than before.
There are, however, reasons to hope for the exit of this deadly dump.
War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation does not give rise to optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on 21 November, would be implemented, the clashes that took place this week only strengthened the positions of the strikers on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamic movement Hamas, who came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, said that they had forced Israel to retreat despite their losses.
Although some group leaders have been destroyed and 1.7 million people are trapped in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory controlled by the now more moderate Fath movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can come to the conclusion that time is working on them.
As the influence of Islamic movements in the Arab world is growing, new influential and rich friends are emerging in Hamas.
The reborn regional leader of Turkey, who at one time was the closest ally of Israel to Muslim countries, supported Hamas, who followed her example, Qatar, one of the richest and dynamicly developing States of the Persian Gulf.
The protracted supporters of Hamas claim to establish an Islamic half-month round Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the army of Hezbollah is ruling, to Syria, where the increasingly pro-Islamic rebels will overthrow the power of Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the king's allies are threatened by the king.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred at the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood was reinforced by President Muhammad Morris.
Hosni Mubarak, which was ruled by Egypt for 30 years and was defeated in 2011, was a world dictator who did not pay particular attention to Hamas.
Muslim brothers, on the contrary, are an organization, much like Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.
In future diplomatic arrangements, Hamas may become a significant player, whose voice will not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, Israel ' s hotline supporters will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was engaged.
The Israeli Iron Dome has justified the cost of its establishment and has successfully destroyed many of Hamas launches.
The citizens of Israel can sleep quietly, at least for a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its continuing position; many European countries also blamed Hamas for the beginning of the last round of violence.
Another important factor was Israel ' s economic prosperity, particularly with the Government of Binjin Netanyahu, who had largely ignored the peace process.
Although some 30 Israelis have been killed since 2004, Israel has been able to minimize the problem of deadly terrorists, in part from the wall of the West Bank of Jordan, a large part of the unrecognised Palestinian State, and protect Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite such illegal acts in the light of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, in preparation for the 22 January elections, has been combined with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Abigail Liberman, very comfortable.
What is the point of creating and giving Palestinians their own State?
If they put all their power into their hands on the West Bank, would they not start the missiles on Israel's side, as their congregations in the Gaza Strip do?
It would be better to keep them behind the wall and strongly push any attempt to lift their heads.
It is possible that the hardline supporters will win; however, their calculations may be contradicted by the Arab Spring.
While Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries, have no warm feelings for Israel, their internal challenges will become a priority.
The defence part of the Israeli budget is more than all its Arab neighbours, together.
Linking war with the regional superpower would hardly help Arab Governments strengthen their own economy.
The pragmatism of Egypt's President, Murcy, who worked with Barack Obama on the ceasefire, was a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel must, at least, take into account the long-term implications of its policies.
As democratic change takes place in the Arab countries, the deprivation of the right to self-determination by Palestinians is a slow-acting bomb that will explode early or late in the territories occupied by Israel, like the bus that was blown in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of a democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic aspect of the growth of the Arab population is only exacerbating these problems.
For blood transfusions, which are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement, the international community has to pay for the growing discontent.
Both sides need an external impulse
The only solution remains to be called upon by well-being representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the education of two States and Israel's replacement for security.
The hope that the ceasefire will allow other countries to have a more effective influence on the side of the conflict remains not too pressing in the short term.
Egypt, which has long taken a decision to overload arms in the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, has, as never, a beneficial position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the shared use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fath movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian State than a forthcoming UN vote, which could result in the recognition of the virtual state of Palestine.
President Obama should also play his part in putting Israel at the negotiating table.
During his first term, he did not present his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
After returning to the White House, he continued to demonstrate that he did not want to be involved in the problem.
It's a catastrophicly short-sighted position.
The United States is vitally interested in the stability of the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
A uniform package for cigarettes has entered into force in Australia.
The warning of the harm of smoking and the image of the disease affected by parts of the body is contrasted with that of the ungulate green boxes, which are the same for all brands of cigarettes.
In the world's first practice, the Australian law on the uniform packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logo and colouring of different brands with the same color of an olive oil box with vivid pictures of damaged body parts and images of children whose health is damaged by their parents ' smoking.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions warning of the harm of smoking, the only difference between the spots introduced in a mandatory manner from this Saturday is the name of the marks printed in the same small font.
These are the most serious conditions in the world for the packaging of tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, thereby depriving them of the harmful habit of fashion.
Such a decision was based on research that showed that people who did not start smoking up to 26 years of age in 99 cases of 100 never become smokers.
“It is obvious that even at the very young age, children understand the meaning that they are trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of packaging,” explains Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, referring to a study showing that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the princess's idea.
Australia is one of the world's smallest proportions of smokers, so these changes will not be particularly affected by the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
The tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of the law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market where cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will have a serious impact different from that of its initiators," said Scott Makintair, a representative of the British American Tobacco company in Australia.
Sub-contracted operations as part of manufacturing of sub-contracted operations as part of manufacturing of goods for sale in Australia.
For some, the new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha, from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for porters and silicones, covering the unpleasant pictures of the package, has grown rapidly (practically from zero) since only two months ago, such companies as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have lost the case in the High Court of Australia, where they tried to appeal this law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already carried out some six thousand products for optical trading companies and is expecting a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential for the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of the experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are addressed.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws making illegal television advertising cigarettes and supporting them in sports activities, as well as banning sellers from displaying cigarettes on the spot, tobacco advertising has moved online.
The Government of Australia has prohibited local companies and websites from posting advertising on the network, but it cannot limit this foreign site.
"If you trade tobacco products and you only have this little lasaika left, the idea of moving your goods online will prove to be extremely captivating," explains Becky Freeman, researching public health issues at Sydney University.
The Freeman notes the increase in the number of reviews on trademarks written by individuals allegedly by ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is this really the case of a citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he hasn't given up on the force and time and made a videotape, or is the advertising company behind it?
The Australian Office of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more involved in adapting to new rules than in advertising.
The tobacco industry has even resorted to measures such as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new rules: these States submit claims under the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been subject to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations with all these countries with Australia are very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plibersek, the Government had discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory placement of photos to prevent the harm of smoking.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The capacity to strengthen laws is being considered in Britain, New Zealand, the USA and India.
The majority of smokers in Australia do not respond to the news.
These pictures don't bother me.
I just don't pay attention.
"You're just getting a cigarette out of the carnival and you're driving a doll in the carnival," explains Victor El Haeg, who buys a cigarette with a picture of a mouthful on the doll.
I'm telling you, the only thing that can make me leave is my little daughter.
James Yu, the owner of the King of the Pack’s tobacco store in the centre of Sydney, claims that the same package has complicated the task of placing the goods by poles.
"I used to have the time for the new party, and now it's four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and ban cigarettes at all, then we would say, "Well, well, we're done closing the store," he says, shaking his hands up.
Squeeze in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections is not so bad.
That day, thanks to me, I had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane had mechanical failure and replaced it with another plane that we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of the boredom.
I won't lie to you.
The full day at the airport waiting for the trip is really boring, and there's no hard work to do with books, magazines, iPhones, or even free-trade shops.
In recent times, however, more and more child development scientists and specialists have spoken out in favour of neglect.
They say that in certain situations we and our children are not so bad.
This forces the brain to withdraw from interesting related topics that may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world we're all standing in front of someone's screen, the benefits of being bored are beyond us.
Maybe we should try to get bored?
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think, like many others, that it was boring to invent relatively recent times when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgaria, author of the book "Intact History of the Skuki" (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, it can be a very ancient story," he says.
The walls of Pompeii contain Latin inscriptions about the plague dating back to the first century.
This remains an open question about how we understand the shock.
The problem is, says John D. Isud, Deputy Professor of York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of the shock has often changed.
Having studied the research material on the subject and asked the task force of 100 people, Professor Izuda and his colleagues came to the following definition: boring is when people "want, but cannot do what they would like to do."
The difference between nausea and apathy, he says, is that the bereaved person does not do something that he would like to do.
You don't want to do anything when you're sick.
He said, chiefly in the suffering affliction, that it was “a violation of attention and related deterioration of the mood and feeling that time was taking place slowly”.
According to the description, nausea may appear to be very similar to depression.
Professor Izud, however, argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, the people who are suffering see the causes of the problems in the surrounding world and the circumstances, and the people who are suffering from depression see the problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think it's boring when we're really hard to focus on something.
In his study "Insensible reason: the definition of a miscarriage from attention", published in the September edition of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Izida and his colleagues referred to a previous experiment, whose participants heard a vote reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds not related to the telegram in the neighbouring room, others heard the same sounds in low noise, so they could hardly be understood, and the third group only listened to a voice without a side-by-side soundtrack.
Those who heard low-density television noted that they were bored, that they often found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for it and attributed it to the inconvenience.
When we try to focus our attention on a difficult or interesting task, the interruption may cause a shock, says Mark J. Fenske, professor of neurology at the University of Gwelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something interesting, "for example, looking at the stream of goods on the conveyor in search of a marriage, the distracting music can help to avoid being bored."
It is believed that when people start to climb a chair or paint a cartoon on a paper list, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that such actions really help not to relax physically.
"The study has shown that children who are not prohibited from going back and forth, learn better, and remember more information than children who need to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
At some point, all of us are bored: at the delay of the trip (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninterested movie.
However, different people are showing different degrees of tenderness.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “spanning scale” to measure such individual characteristics.
Questions and allegations, such as, “Many of what I have to do, uniformly and monotonous” or “I’m too interesting, so there’s no time for anything”.
Through such questionnaires, researchers have determined that boys miss more girls, says Steven Vodanovic, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when there are various external distributors.
In general, however, adolescents are often bored.
In 1991, Rid Larson, professor of personal and public development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment that linked him to almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored in school and during homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside school.
Only 3% of parents have noted that they are bored.
Professor Larson notes that he does not have any data on what would be such a shock now 21 years later.
However, he knows that “at an early age, there is a tendency to be bored”, mainly because children and adolescents are not able to fully decide what to do with them.
Let's go back to my original question: is this boring useful?
Sometimes there is no, because in extreme manifestations it can, as research shows, drive people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to escape the shock.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have been thinking about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who has devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us we should do something else; it's boring," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
However, this same brain does not always know what to do.
If you're bored and you're making that energy a guitar or a culinary experience, you'll do better.
But if you get to watch TV, you'll get better for a while, and it'll be over soon.
So, if your child is bored and you give him iPad, he'll stop crying, but he won't learn to struggle with the grief alone or in any other way manage his time and employment, says Professor Fenske.
“And such self-regulation skills are in different situations,” he said.
Your child learns not only to take care of himself, he also learns self-control at all.
I don't think it's boring to carry.
However, it is not worth considering it to be bad either.
You should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Yjudd agrees.
"We see this in a way that we need to experience more often the shock, while the shock is a very unpleasant, inalienable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get rid of their constant concerns and just relax.
"In today's world, we've become accustomed to constant overstimulation of emotions," he says, "and when there's silence, we're lost and we don't know what to do."
While it is uncertain how a new law on the legalization of marijuana will apply in the state of Colorado
Anthony Orosko, a 19-year-old football team and a student of the community college in the south-east of Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offence that will soon be completely legal throughout the state: the storage of a small portion of marijuana and the tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosko said that once in September he and his friends were in Lamar and drove to a car on the border with Kansas when they were stopped by the police.
After the police found out in the marijuana machine, Mr. Oroski had come to the drug storage court and had the power to adapt to the use of drugs - small offences, each of which was charged with a fine of $100 - and the date of the trial.
"We are being treated like criminals," said Mr. Orosko.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of uncertainty, which has continued for several weeks after the State of Colorado voted to legislate the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small cases is not so much dependent on the law as on the place of consideration.
The allegations of minor marijuana-related offences have already been recorded in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, D.C., which has taken similar action.
Police stations have already stopped accusing people of being 21 years of age and older than keeping small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law enters into force in a few weeks.
However, in more conservative districts, Colorado prosecutors have decided to consider existing marijuana cases and continue to be responsible for the storage of this drug.
At the same time, in some cities, from Denver’s suburbs to the mountains of the West, they vote to prevent the emergence of new, licensed marijuana stores in their places.
"It's all going so fast that I don't even know what to expect anymore," said Daniel J. Outs, police chief in the city of Avora in the east of Denver.
The representatives of the monitoring bodies in Washington, D.C., are also depriving themselves of their heads.
They must establish rules for the licensing of the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all must be done before 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, controls the majority of other states to solve the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado, a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, a representative of the Board for the Control of Production and the Marketing of Alcohol Products in Washington State.
But no one can do more now, Mr. Smith recognizes than to make any suggestions and hopes that it will work.
"We don't have the current precedent that we could focus on," he says.
The Washington State Bill, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will cast the state into uncertainty throughout the year when the state licensing system is not yet available and the right to possession of marijuana is already legal.
There are still some simple technical aspects that need to be resolved during this period, such as how to find a balance between the state's "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on its trade at 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and children's gardens.
"It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana trading companies in the range of cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the recently established marijuana Legalization Center.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police Outs from Aurora sent an e-mail to his subordinate that the city's prosecutor's office would no longer attract those who were 21 years of age to possession of a small number of marijuana, and that the police would cease to identify people in these violations “from this point”.
Police chief Outs reported that the police would monitor compliance in the city with the rules governing the activities of marijuana-producing people for medical purposes and would prosecute illegal drug traffickers and drug distributors.
The prosecutor of the Wild District of North Colorado, Ken Bak, is a more stringent approach to this issue.
After voting on the bill, he stated that the prosecutor's office would continue to be responsible for the possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage the treatment of its users.
At the present time, 119 persons were accused of holding two or less grandiose marijuana, although many of them were accused of other violations.
"The obligation of our institution is to pursue actions that are considered to be criminal at the time they are committed," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The response was undiminished even in places such as the Mesa rural district, where voters rejected the proposal for the legalization of marijuana.
The Grand Jankshn police, the largest city in the county, no longer hold a small amount of drugs in charge of minors.
The District Prosecutor Pete Hautcinger supported this decision, but also decided not to record open charges related to the storage of marijuana.
"I believe that to ensure compliance with the law until it is changed is our direct duty," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the inhabitants of the State of Colorado who took part in the vote supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana in public and legal activities would not be easy.
And the conflicting reaction of the population in different parts of the state has led to the indifference of the local authorities to the state experiment with marijuana.
"The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier," explains Sean Makalister, a Danish lawyer representing the interests of the marijuana defendants, and a local representative of the National Maritime Law Reform Organization.
"They have persecuted people for so long that they can't actually calm down now that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington are the first states in which small numbers of marijuanas are the same as alcohol. It is decided to become a country-wide experimental field to verify the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Legalization partners and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they expect instructions from the federal authorities that continue to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Legalization partners hope that the Office of Justice will address this issue.
Despite a number of large-scale rationalizations of the arrests of traffickers and patients using marijuana on medical evidence, the federal government has in most cases made good use of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The Office of the Drug Control Officers would not be able to hack into the house to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but would it be easy for them to close their eyes to the regulated authorities of the state of the recreational marijuana store, which was authorized by the new law, to consider Kevin A. Sabeth, a former drug dealer in Obama's administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not expect the actions of the federal authorities.
Prior to the presidential elections, some local administrations approved a moratorium for opening new marijuana sales shops, which could not be opened earlier than a year later.
Last week, Monterey, a city in the western part of the state, issued a six-month ban on marijuana trafficking, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in such a situation that we're going to issue a license to someone, and then this will cause serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nikolson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petronella Whitet: I was survived from Oxford because I was a conservator.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern-day analogous to the ancient symposium that laid the foundations of civilization -- freedom and tolerance.
However, after two weeks of training at the historic college of the Oxford University College at the end of the 1980s, I picked up a cadona and left, which was the first scandal in my life.
My father didn't survive and cry.
Friends have been cut off from so much.
The Evening Standard said I dropped out of college because I didn't like my peers having sex in the next room.
Author E. Norman Wilson was joking that I was leaving because I had to drink some brown tea.
It wasn't really that fun.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically disturbed and scared.
Not entirely because of my rather unusual name or what I learned in private school.
I was tormented only for one reason, and in this glorious circle of education it looked like this barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now dead Woodro Wight, was known as Margaret Tetcher, and I was himself a supporter of the conservators.
You'll ask why you should remember that now?
According to recent data, a new generation of law-centred students suffers the same trauma.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of students in Oxford was so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that which was granted to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the College of Corpus Christi College in Cambridge say that they "are often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and forced to feel unwanted" because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative to the Committee on Equal Rights to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation has only increased the recent BBC 2 documentary on the policy in the student environment "Strana miraclees: young, smart and right" in which conservators presented themselves with eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cook, the former president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, who travels to Rolls-Roise, wears a silver suit and a tie with a silver bead.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are making “nobs because of the increase in fees for learning”.
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Association of Nottingham University Conservatives, said in an interview with one of the resurrected newspapers that “in the university environment, there is an increase in bias towards left-wing views.
The people who do not even know us think we are in the past, and we are not punished by the powerful children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, a student of Corpus Christi's College of History, in which a request for protection was made, calls such an atmosphere “unusual”, and 19 years old, the new president of the Association of Conservatives at Oxford University, says that the attitude of students at the university to right-centralist views has deteriorated considerably.
"This is a threat to both the intellectual discussion atmosphere and to the normal life of the club members," she said.
The first few weeks in Oxford I wasn't just in the minority, I was alone.
I arrived there in September 1986, with a slave and a pregnant girl of eighteen years.
Oxford ran away from hate to a conservative party.
Prior to that year, the university rejected the former student, Margaret Tetcher, because of the reduction in the budget allocations for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, it would be unusual for even Stalinists.
In the first week of the first course, when the students met each other and with the teachers, I first felt what was waiting for me.
I still didn't know that teachers not only looked through their fingers at the student conservators' grass, but they were happy to take part in it.
Political issues - the strike of strikers, privatization and the Government ' s disagreement to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in the UAR - have been penetrated through the covered wooden panels of the auditorium wall.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I wasn't ready for what followed.
"Miss Whitet," said the teacher, now dead Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
Text gave me a hard time, I quit.
Harry Pitt was a very greedy person with a guy like a cake.
"Tatcherists don't learn French in principle or they just don't have enough brains?" he asked.
Other students have been bitten.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take a few basic French lessons in free time, if you are of course not very busy going back to society," pett said.
I'm back in my room completely unhappy.
That night at college, I sat alone for lunch; then someone grabbed me on my shoulder.
It was James, a second-class student from the English School, who was represented as a member of the Association of Conservatives of the University.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Anyone who is suspected of being in sympathy with the conservators will be exposed.
It's not easy for me, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Tetcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most of the first-class conservatives pretend to be labyrinthists."
Later, in the local pub, I tried to subjugate.
I insisted that I don't agree with everything Margaret Tetcher says.
The heat failed.
The first professor of philosophy, politics and economy, who was studying in Ethan, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're infected."
Other students took his words.
I've been cheated, dirty.
"How do conservators have sex?" asked one of them.
- They're stealing another one, right?"
I felt like I must have felt gay before the end of the sixties.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet the singles just under the cover of night?
Will I be forced to become a lobbyist and hide my current beliefs?
The next three years have become like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for being an adviser to Tatcher on foreign policy issues and one of its guardians.
In college, he almost didn't show up.
He despised it for the provinciality, melancholy and commitment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he graduated as a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents ’ home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unaccompanied capital friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his training in the fortieth years, any political views were adopted.
"But this is the best university in the world," he complained.
- They can't do that, but they can't do it in the city of dreary caves...
Even my Communist friends always behave inconveniently."
His wet eyes were dulled.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop the university."
I've been exhausted on a permanent trip to London and my emotional protection is weak.
My friend, as well as the conservator, did not withstand pressure and gave up his convictions.
The next week at the seminar, when the ordinary history teacher seriously called me an enemy of the people, I decided to do the same.
In my soul, I've come up with shame, and I've admitted that "I miss my parents' brains," and I've called them "old fools."
The drive was short.
The last iron on the roof of my career in Oxford was destined to kill my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns each week for Rupert Merdok’s publications.
My door was closed.
I didn't leave, and after five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I picked up the chemist and sat on the first train to London.
I didn't come back.
You can call me a plax and a stick.
But within eighteen years, no one should be the object of such abuse and intimidation in the educational institution.
The saddest thing is that it was Oxford, who not only released fourteen prime ministers of the Torah, but is now hiding behind the undeserved reputation of a university in which equality and freedom are appreciated.
"Valentino prefers the elegance of glory"
About the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Shissy", which was opened this week in London, ABC is interviewing Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other well-known Italian designer clients
Somerset-haus, former residence of English Queen Elizabeth I, is the only place in the British capital to take a exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized this at the opening of "Valentino: Master of the Shiite", a triumphal retrospective exhibition that combines more than 130 high-mode plates created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unrepeated Italian accent.
This exhibition is a final part of history, the only character of which is "il sinore" Garavani, but it could not be written without its named clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and far - reaching world.
In the first hall of this exhibition, open before 3 March, personal letters and photographs of the most famous aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga-han to Lord Snoudon, including Mary Shantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social uptake: from the modest port city of Voger in northern Italy to the international "Elitha".
To be in love with the Queen's court is nothing wrong with that.
"They don't even throw out their cigarettes on your beautiful envelope, as some beautiful pop-music stars do," says Fiona Tischen-Bornemica.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unparalleled host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all liked to come to his jokes in Gsthaade," explains the ex-wife Hayney Tischen, a close friend of the forgotten beautys like Marella Annelli or Eugenia Niarhos.
Valentino always preferred the elegance of glory.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Maçé, representing Valentino
The Argentine model, Valerie Maçé, reminds us of the charismatic model.
Once we went to dinner at his house, it was after showing a fashion on the Spanish square in Rome many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, the youngest.
Valentine’s style was displayed everywhere - in every detail of his apartment, in her clothing, in food, in music.
"Each of Valentino's guests had made himself feel important and loved," recalled the "top model", whose work with the model began in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He never gets out of fashion, because his sketches are the present art production," she concludes.
Parentheses Around the World
The life of Garavani is not a story of wealth, but of love with full reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Sommerset-haus galleries was turned into a glamorous six - foot - long [60 m] stage that offers a change of role: the visitor takes the place of the models and is to defile on the stage, the savory of the "glasses" of the spices that are worn by the bishops of Valentino, such as the plaice chosen by Jacqueline Kennedy for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume used by Monica Whitty in the Nights, or a coat of breast and skin belonging to the emperor Fara Dibb.
In this audience, the models make the names shine like Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Matte-Marith from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria, or Sofia Gabsburg.
Naty Abascal and modeler, 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentine's first is like love, "it's impossible to forget."
I remember him wonderfully.
These were pants, skirts, belts and jackets from the 1971-1972 autumn collection.
"It was a gift he did to me," says Natty Abbascal, a museum designer.
"I like the rest of him for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he stresses our beauty," adds the former Duke of Feria.
I like the colors he uses: they have many lights and they come to him.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and legislator Patrizia dell Jovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she was in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and I lived in Italy, I dreamed I'd be age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally, that time came at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first salary from Valentino to put him on a holiday in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Linh.
It was a red plate, with a jubilee, a corsage in the warehouse and a cut without a bra.
"It was a dream that became a show," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is fashion-like, his passion is temporary," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday pay from a model with "maximum caution... because the pay is not just a pay, it's also a set of memories that accompany him."
"King" Modes
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset-Haus is the wedding pay for Marie-Shantal Miller for her wedding with Pauls from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “girls” (as the model calls their sweats) to make this line of ivory-coloured silk with a tug, twelve species of different circles and a loop in four and a half metres.
According to the journalist Suzie Menques, the highest authority of the specialized press, the pay is a very high fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of customers from high light".
For many years, Valentino has been the best representative of the elite.
The Horseman of the Great Cross (the highest rank in Italy), the Knight of Work, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Words awarded by the Order of the Honorary Legion, Garvani collected as much honors as any of his clients' wives.
"I have always drawn attention to his clarity, his calmness, his accurate and unmistakable appearance," recalls Dr. Arenberg.
The last time I saw him a month ago at the Orse Museum at the Christmas Eve.
He was sitting at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was useless, there's no time for him."
If that's what the princess says...
Hardest profession in the world: hackers with Kawah-Jenna
For four euros, Indonesian hunters risk life and health, covering 70 kilograms of sulphur at the top of the volcano on steep rocky tropics
There are people whose job is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
Among them was Anto Vijaya, one of 400 hunters who were working for the life of a grain of grain in the Kawah-Ijen volcano, located east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anto goes down to the bottom of the crater, where the gas that rises from the earth’s depths stops in contact with air.
The large pieces of cheese, which can reach a total weight of 70 kg, are laid in two bamboo boxes, peeled the baskets on their shoulders and carried them up on a rocky road.
Up to the top of the volcano, with a height of 2,386 metres, only 250 metres, but the heavy trucks need more than 40 minutes to get up with a sharp step, with difficulty maintaining balance and cautiously pushing the road so as not to fall down and fall off the cliff.
They know that one false step can stand in their lives, as it did with a tourist from France, who crashed off the Kawah-Jenna rock a few years ago.
Khatters from Kawah-Jenna earn 5 Eurocents for every kilogram of cheese that they earn
On top of that, they cross the road between tourists who photograph them, as if they were surrounded by circuses and, with heavy corsets, they walk three kilometers to the weight that the mining company had been able to hear above, at a height of 1,850 metres.
This is about PT Kandi Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, rather, not to say, its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euros) per kilogram of serum.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) of petroleum production, since it is used to produce mushrooms, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamites and even to highlight sugar.
"As a rule, we earn about 46,000 rupees (€3.8) for every walk," explains Anto, who usually carries three daily rupees.
It spends three hours each and finally feels broken, but they allow it to store 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a miser for such inhuman efforts, it is three times more than he would have earned in the field.
"The daily wage to the miners is very high on local measures, where 15,000 rupees are paid per day for coffee collection (€1.2) and the average monthly salary of two million rupees (167 rupees) " , explains the trucker who previously worked as a stoner on the Bali tourist island.
Its salary was 75,000 rupees per day and the area was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banjuvanga, a town not far from the volcano, for a major reason that in Indonesia is as devastating as a sister: "I married Bali's girl, where some Hindus, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got eyes on toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, Anto spent three years at risk in Kawah-Ijene, whose serum has already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special points.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got eyes on the toxic gases that release the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for his dream.
"I work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
The punishment of life, this pleasant and smart young man could be a tourist guide, an officer or a porter in the hotel, but instead he did the work of the mill.
For the dirty wooden cab with other carriers, it gets up every day at two hours of the night, because the cheese does not stop running at night when its characteristic yellow color turns into blue and shines in the dark.
A lot of tensions, Anto goes down to the crater, exposing himself to a little background connected to his helmet, which he himself bought for his money.
Approximately 400 carriers are pumping grain with cheese on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano.
Despite the high profits, the mining company did not mechanize the production of cheese for cost savings and does not provide any equipment to carriers who were working on their own account and with such losses.
In fact, they do not receive even a portion of 30,000 rupees (€2.5) of the photo collection, which, along with the entry ticket for 15,000 rupees (€1.2), is taken from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its people.
"This work is for cattle, not for humans," says Badrusin, a 42-year-old Korean carrier who spent three decades in Kawah-Jenne, since he left college.
He is able to raise up to 110 kilograms, and he assures that he will endure the work “as much as he can” because he needs money for the education of his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the serum burns the throat and warms the eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches prey in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so pronounced that no one complains about their severe diseases... more serious, obviously than their usual problems with breathing, arthritis, knees pain and swelling on their shoulders that have become deformed under the weight of the cortex.
By balancing the back basket, Onenik can now only raise 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions produce 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to a warehouse in Tamunsari, more than 20 miles [18 km] by a narrow drop in the area of adults.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Uninik, wide-opening mouth with a few teeth missing.
Of his five children, aged 30, he also works as a cheese carrier.
Time goes by, but poverty always grows from generation to generation, one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what human mills from Kawah-Jenna do.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singapore is accused of careers, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I'm a Patriot husband, you're my wife Patriot, we'll fulfill our civil debt and create life!
It may seem unlikely that these lines were part of the advertising of fancy beads, but despite this - or perhaps because of that - the video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These phrases are part of a rap, which uses local reservations such as "Let's put bao (bun) in the oven" to smile at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, is hoping that they will be able to draw attention to this problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their “national debt”.
This thing was exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's a major problem in the country.
We're the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt it's the subject we have to touch.
We knew that the Government had been trying to do a lot, for example to start spirits with pheromones or to organize fast-stimulation parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we wondered why we wouldn't make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, but to create a rap?
1.2 Child
Whoever doesn't understand it so easily, it's the Government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The public package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 for the child, prolongs maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low effectiveness.
Singapore is a rich and highly technological city in South-East Asia, also known for its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population management, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was below 2 is known as the percentage of replacement in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wey Min, Director of the Office of Policy on Spouse Couples and Families of the National Population Management, said that the reason for "improvement of education" and "a wider range of career opportunities" was the result.
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options for living goals and priorities, besides marriage and family creation," she explains.
These social changes have contributed to the growth of the number of holocausts and to the deferral of marriages and births of children, resulting in a decline in fertility in Singapore.
However, immigration policy, which aims at a sharp increase in immigration to prevent the reduction of the population, causes local people to be blamed.
Singapore has web sites where the almost hidden xenophobia of many new immigrants, especially Chinese people, is being criticized for maintaining low-level wages and not wanting to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that Singapore ' s ruling party won the worst outcome last year in the elections since independence.
After the elections, an attempt was made to resolve the problem, using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility has a known impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, health and immigration policy, Singapore has also begun to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is working hard not to build so little housing.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The City Development Guide has gone into the control of the number of small apartments known as the “popular Box” that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments of 46 square meters are very well sold.
Nevertheless, there is a view that they can contribute to the smooth life - style of the devices that want to build a large family home.
But Lim Yu Sunh, CEO of EL Developers, says that their "obligatory boxes" are sold much faster than more spatial copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are purchased for a few days, even a week, faster than larger ones.
As a result, our income is increasing.
However, he recognized that the new rules provided clearer guidelines for devices that had previously been put in motion if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Overloaded
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules could be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans working in the Centre ' s financial headquarters, they seemed to have no special effect.
"People are very stressed, housing expensive, as well as education, and because of this, many people are putting it off," says the young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it is important for me to have my own money and time," said another young man for 20 years.
Men and women refer to their career, stress and prices for housing and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the Government has been trying to encourage its citizens to have children, as far as childbirth is concerned, the last word remains for Singaporeans.
Online Personals - Online Personals
Confidentiality.
According to the King's Academy of Spanish, it is a private or “personal sphere of life that has the right to protect against any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his everyday life and in social networks?
Does he understand the dangers posed by Internet discussions that are unlikely to be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriodico interviewed five children between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent network users.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", in the personal plane, and "the password and the name of the user" when they applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't post," says ten-year-old Jorge, when he's trying to explain the importance of personal sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's been keeping records for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not the whole world," he says.
I'm loading beautiful pictures or pictures of the game on the FB.
I'm also having fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photograph that's not mine, or someone who's acting stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that he is ill-informed to publish inappropriate photos of oppressed people, crimes or to write insults or angry comments.
Jorge is convinced that he knows 35 friends he has in the FB and nine of his blogs on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother in class, she has a password for one of the records.
I put on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just load them," he adds.
"Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or friends in a hurry," he says.
Without thinking, he answers that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
It would not be considered to be someone who recommended it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This adolescent has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and recently admits that he does not know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one came to trust him and asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I get pushed or demanded, I'll just remove them from my record," he admits.
José became a successor to Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
A boy is not a stranger to what he knows today as a cyberbang.
One of my friends was blackmailed on the social network.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He didn't know who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim has not removed the record.
"Just included confidentiality."
He then explained the consistency of the steps to be taken to set the record in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would load photos of known people in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I didn't like people or if I wanted to.
"I want to know it's a cybermobbing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and teacher of education and training, believes that in order to send children and adolescents, the purpose of social networks should be to inform.
"The Internet has appeared as a tool to find information, but the rules of the game have changed with the appearance of these sites," she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prensky, professor of pedagogy at the University of Yemen and author of labor Digital Aboriginals and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are those, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are learning ourselves," she says.
It explains that this topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken when maturity is not sufficient to do so”.
"So that they are selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that such confidentiality is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do this, it's useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell the stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like to be photographed like what you published about your friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you sign photos with dinner, do you ask for permission from other people to mark them?
And yet, does everyone need to know what you're doing at any time?
Another point is to let them know that they have to go online just as they do online.
The rules are the same.
"On the Internet, a person conducts himself with respect, responsibility and other principles, as must be on social networks," she claims.
Clarification
Estuardo Guardia, a university teacher, a professor of primary education and an educational consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social networking policies in good faith.
Knowing each item, they have good reason to talk to children about the conditions for opening an Internet account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published," he says.
According to Guardia, the key question is to remind children of the lesson "don't talk to strangers."
UNASUR Summit ends without the announcement of the Lima Declaration
VI The Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) was concluded today in Peru without the announcement of the Lima Declaration, which had been announced previously and theoretically signed by binding parties to the family.
Efé has repeatedly tried to obtain access to the document signed at the VI General Assembly of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Administration of the President have indicated on the main page that it will be transmitted after the closure, but have then confirmed that it will be published at some point on the Peruvian Government website.
On the subject of the text, they indicated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Olianta Umala, during short press statements.
The access of journalists to information about the Summit has been limited at all times.
During the day, only the video of the Presidential Assembly was broadcast in the press room without a "closed meeting" message.
A lot of information, which was circulated among reporters, was transmitted by the press secretaries of some UNASUR Governments attending the meeting but not Peruvian.
The only paper distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused the discontent of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who requested more information.
Subsequently, the administration of President Peru sent an electronic message to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was Umala’s statement, not the official document that the summit had completed.
Last October, Peru adopted the IIIth Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and at the same time, despite the insistent demands of the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not circulated.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure transmission systems for all journalists, but limited information.
The summit also concluded a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt the verdict of the Hague Court, which regulates the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olianta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinier, met at a regional meeting and ratified that the decision of the International Court of Justice, which began on Monday in The Hague to hear the statements of both parties, would be respected in the framework of the indictment that Lima had brought against Santiago.
"We will respect and enforce a decision that will clarify the differences we are currently submitting to this international court," said Umala, next to her Chilean colleague.
"If there were and will be a country that respects international law, a peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," he added, and welcomed Umalu's hand in the background of the flags of those two countries.
The two presidents confirmed that they would be subject to the International Court of Justice immediately after Colombia protested this week of the Divine Covenant, under which it recognized that it was subject to the verdicts of the International Court of Justice following a decision on the maritime borders of Nicaragua, which it felt to be wrong.
The summit took place in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Ugo Chaves; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Kristina Kirshner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR had been suspended since 2011 following the influence of former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The Acting President, Olianta Umala, was responsible for opening the debate in the morning and closing the summit, to be heard later on the afternoon in Limasian time.
The Head of State read the outcome document, which reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects had been approved for South American countries, amounting to $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries would take “the important steps towards the purpose of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the place of residence agreements”.
He reported that action was being taken to improve “cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and organized transnational crime, to increase the availability of medicines, low Internet access in all parts of South America, and to take into account the combined and effective risks of natural disasters”.
As Europe is in crisis, "the economic union (Latin America) should not have a triumphing foundation, but should serve to expand our productive base and provide a better future for our cities," Umala added.
"We have decided to give the group the privilege of 31 flag projects that will improve the link between South America and, in particular, in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and creating new economic schemes," said the Peruvian President in a read-in communication.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five belong to Peru and are limited by the cross-sectional axis in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two focussed on a long relationship with Ecuador, but he did not provide any more details.
The outcome document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace to be united and to have good relations between neighbours was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In this regard, President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before participating in a regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortego, on Saturday in Mexico to negotiate in a respectful manner on the issue of the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the International Court of Justice challenged by Bogotá.
"Afternoon tomorrow, maybe I'll meet President Daniel Ortgoy," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaraguan pact will require discussion with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are scheduled to attend the new president of the country, Enrique Penje Njeto.
Also at the summit, the block ministers met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan to strengthen dialogue and solidarity on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNNASUR, although the last participation is suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America must learn in Europe about the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common nationality is the goal in which “South America, in this case, must be taught in Europe”.
Korea, which participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told Peru that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and in other clashes, "even now they are practically one parent."
It protected, in this context, a draft establishing South American citizenship, which was approved by UNASUR countries.
"It is necessary to achieve free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as has already been done with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactive sectors that want us back in the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also proved himself a proponent of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS), subject to a reduction in the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and to take into account those who signed the San Jose Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who read lessons will never make any commitments, and we South Americans are signing everything.
"It is unexplained that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and funded by the United States," he said, looking forward to political asylum, given by Ecuador as the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assangu.
Correa assured her that she did not regret the decision, because he did not betray his principles with him, but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that in his time, “there were certain suspicions that Assang would be extradited to a third country and would not comply with the process”.
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding to come to his territory for questioning the alleged sexual offence, while “sweden law only considers it possible to implement it through a videoconference that could be made by the Ambassador of Ecuador to London”.
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of physical and mental deterioration of Assanga.
"I haven't talked to him since he came to our embassy, but the Ambassador told me he had a small legit problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of State.
What is really there is a danger of deterioration of his physical and mental health due to infestation in a small space without the ability to exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the issue of asylum granted to Assangu since June in the equatorial embassy in London was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, and stressed that there was negotiations in London to find solutions to the problem of the incest of the founder WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, this word we do not use in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judiciary, because Assanga's lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European institutions," he said.
And he said, "If Britain gives the guarantee of integrity tomorrow, it will be over."
And if Sweden, as well as its legislation and as it has already done in other cases, would question Mr. Assanga at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or would question him about Skype, the problem would be exhausted tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to prove herself a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that there was no “intellectuality, incompetence and lies that distort freedom of expression”.
"The main enemies of freedom of the press are not exportious politicians, but bad journalists who support survival, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this respect, he remained satisfied that neither these journalists, "the bankers nor the bourgeois gegemon countries do not own Ecuador", and added that, being re-elected, "will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction".
Korea also supported the decision to retain Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the following elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for the revolutions under the rule of law", because in fact "this has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian President also felt that his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos' wish to hold negotiations with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which was in favour of the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At this point, this decision is not being complied with.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
It is necessary to process them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also hoped for a good conclusion to the maritime border dispute held in the same court in Peru and Chile, and said that “It is correct for Latin America to address international authorities if the two countries commit themselves to making a decision as hard as it is”.
As a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador for the third term of office, he indicated that he considered this option “with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes rather difficult”.
Correa assured us that if she won the election in February 2013, she would leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unfair situations such as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be corrected by the political authority.
"My political movement thought that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I had to acknowledge this responsibility," he said.
In the event of a victory, it would be my last time in the President's office, and then we will leave public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
"That's the solution," he confirmed.
Korea also referred to a new course of treatment by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to the treatment that had already been planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean an increase in the health of President Chavez," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State took part today in the sixth summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS mortality today - late diagnosis result
The plant was 21 years old when it was announced that its analysis on AIDS had produced a positive result.
"I'm as deaf as I am," he remembers the hard one, despite the whole doctor's touch, the moment.
Young man hid it from his family.
When he decided to cope with his illness alone, he wanted to know as much about her as possible, and his efforts were justified - he had already mentioned his 43rd birthday.
The factory is one of the "older" HIV patients of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he fell in 1994, with no obstacles.
He's been living with a diagnosis of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) for 22 years, and it would be difficult to believe that in the early 1990s, there were too little treatment options, too little knowledge of the disease, too little of the disease, too much of the disease.
So, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a tax."
In other words, having AIDS at the time was a sentence.
Now it's possible to survive this syndrome and do it, not a poor quality of life.
However, not knowing their disease, many people still come when the virus has damaged their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
After 31 years of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the greatest achievement for the moment is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same”, said HCG, HIH, Heime Andrade Viljanueva, referring to this information as confirmed in the prestigious scientific publication in April this year.
Infectious and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depends on the level of damage to the immune system in patients at the start of the diagnosis, with the best life expectancy in those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years of age with 200 CD4, and up to 50 years when 500 CD4 is reported.
Simply put, the above means that one who receives a 25-year-old HIV diagnosis, according to these terms, “supporting control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age”, he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be recalled that the life span of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS's annual report), and it is also true that 60 per cent of the patients in the national database have died since the outbreak of AIDS.
Only 255 people died in the country in 2011 and 187 deaths have already been recorded by May of the year; however, there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why do you still have summer trips?
- I personally don't think the problem is access to treatment.
So I imagine that's how things are in our hospital.
As we haven't had a lack of medication in the last 12 years, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their condition, that is, at the late stages of the disease.
He said: “Ten out of ten patients come when they already have an opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality, so that it is a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide evidence for mass detection for all people who will ask for it.”
In their proposals, experts and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Halisco (COESIDA), as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who sought to verify in a private laboratory only because he had done so to one another and, despite his youth, had already been at the AIDS stage and had even suffered from a cancerous Kaposi, which was one of the most common difficulties.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything.
"I'll still die, but I'd better get three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, I exercise, I take medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of work, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but with mutual responsibility, I care about myself and another person," said the Fabricio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage those who are now afraid in the context of the World AIDS Day.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they are HIV-positive or better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Can not open message
The great gap between health programmes and a simple citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalahar, who has dealt with HIV-related problems.
And the biggest is prevention.
In the areas of this task, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, we have been given one or two before, now we are given hundreds of packages, and this is very good, but it seems that there are those who still do not have access to condoms," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why are they for you?" this is a popular question, with contempt and condemnation, by social workers, school counselors, apologists and health workers who don't want to hear teenagers, has assured the propaganda.
I suggest that this is not an effective distribution; that condoms be not only adjacent and that hundreds of them be in cars in public toilets in places where young people often visit.
It's not a desertion promotion.
It is not about the payment of beer and the motel, Governor Emilio González replied when asked if the reservation could be issued under his direction.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those already engaged in sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Halisko
13.435 summary cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV) have been reported.
The State is taking the fourth place in the national rating on new and summary AIDS and HIV 13 cases.
92% of the infections were sexually transmitted, 6% were bleeding and 2% were perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as in one recorded case there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know about it.
Taking into account the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision that cancels the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the scenario sets a deadline for any national subsidiary company in the neighbouring country that has payment capacity problems.
It appears that the procedures in support of the survival of companies allowed by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of sex and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practical terms, the decision of Judge Harlin Hail on 15 June in the court of bankruptcy of the northern district of Texas left unprotected Mexican firms in front of the person able to arrest their property on that side of Rio Grande.
However, the order opens the door to the leading manufacturer of glass in Mexico for treatment at the United States Supreme Court, showing three inconsistencies.
As an admission, while the judge noted that creditors should be governed by the United States Code of bankruptcy, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth District, located in New Orleans, said that the main proceedings concerned competition in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of non-payment of transnational profile enterprises.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Standardization of International Trade Law was established for this purpose, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict states that, without an inter-firm vote, a majority of the debts that had been owed to the parent company of the Vitro branch would not have been achieved to approve the restructuring.
However, this option is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro wasn't the first time this scheme was taken.
There are dozens of examples, including Agrex and Commercial Mexicana, whose inter-firm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition.
It is also true that reading the votes of the branches, namely, the Vitro creditors who fought against him in the United States courts, namely the Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited funds, would not reach the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
These data are being dropped by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, it accuses Vitro of a difficult situation that has been facing since 2008 in the face of the serious economic crisis that has struck the United States.
Until the González Sada's family has appealed to the appeal court itself for the vote to be brought before his court, that is, five judges, given that they voted only three.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate will be submitted, which will require a review of the proceedings by the Supreme Court of the United States in this case.
It is the worst thing that the court has rejected a document aimed at the Government of Mexico as a friend of the curiae ("second court"), which describes the process to be followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, indicating that it exempts itself from compliance with the agreements signed by both countries in order to link it with article 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, that is to say, the rules established for inter-State insolvency that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Two-board carambol, they're going to be in Vitro and they're going to be in the country.
General balance sheet
Taking into account the complaints lodged for a few months at the table by the Mexicana de Aviación trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraud, has already found a bottleneck by the Association of Air Pilots.
The body led by Carlos Dias Chaves Morino has just submitted a criminal claim against the National Banks Commission and the securities that is accused of obstructing justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney-General on an operation carried out by an entrepreneur to withdraw from the trust fund F/589 Bank IXE 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be directed to purchase shares of the Professional Managing Company.
As you know, Ascarrag Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas branch network.
They're surrounded by Dragon Mart
As a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the common civil society approved the establishment of a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancúne.
We are talking, as you know, about the giant mall for sale and distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean products of the isolated country, with a living area close to 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra was able to unite South-East zone governors to resist the monumental forces that leveled from the lands part of the protected territories and posed serious threats to the industry.
Death of ACTA
In view of the Government ' s refusal to explain the circumstances and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Trade Agreement to Combat Counterfeiting, known as an abbreviation in the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already gone into the archive.
As you know, the action has been implemented, despite the fact that the senate itself has been disqualified from viewing it as a violation of freedom of expression in social networks.

A busy basketball traveler, Hettin Reyes, had been involved in this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, had traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector "Hettin" Reyes.
And before he was brainwashed in 2008, Reyes had been involved in sports for more than 60 years, as a game of small categories, as a game of the upper basketball league, as well as a commander of BSN with the cowboy Baymon and the president of the Federation of basketball.
"I have played many roles in basketball for the duration of my life, including several times as President of BSN, Director-General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalls at the time of the visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
The basketball was my life.
Reyes is not exaggerating, making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all adorned with photographs and memory items collected along his long way, testify to this.
Beaming in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he kept those who remembered his way through Cuba, starting in the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when his 15 years of speech was performed as a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most, because I had been able to be part of eight Kovboev championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or leader.
It was many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I apologized to one in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Minsey in BSN.
From that moment on, he has been a "Cuko" Ortis, who has been a great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember Jean Bartov, who was sent here to the University of Alabama (Birming), said to me, "I have a very strong game for you, a 6'7 growth."
"Do you want?"
And it was the beginning of Minsey, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended the sniper Raymond Gauss, who became a citizen and one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsey brought the Beamoon Championship, Gauss would help win another one.
I enjoyed the Kovboev Championship with Gauss, but already at a distance, because by 1988 it had already been the head of the federation.
By then I had preferred to enjoy the achievements and achievements of Minsi in the national assembly.
I remember the first time we won the U.S. during the 1989 Olympic Qualification Tournament in Mexico.
Then the 1990 World Championship, where we got the fourth place, was to be a bronze if not the Canadian judge who made us play the final game, Reyes said.
The 1990 World Championship team is the best collection you've ever seen?
She was among the best, as well as the one that won the 2004 Olympic Dream Team.
But my favorite was that from the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and broke the United States, which was quite similar to the one that won our bronze at the World Championship.
Not only did Minsi, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and Piculina (Ortis), but also young (Hawier) Tonito Colon and James Carter, Brother Leon (France and Edgar) and Mario Kihote Morales, who were unable to participate in 90 years of knee trauma.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personal composition, but which brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the 1995 Olympic Qualification Tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With the role-playing games like Kanito Neves, Pablo Alise and young Rolando Hurruitner, in exchange for the games temporarily removed from the Pan-American Mar del Plat Championship, we won the gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Piculin Ortis.
Its indicators at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as did Piculin.
And it's not taking his career into account in the different leagues he was playing in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Young people, I really like Leo Ariel's work.
What do you think is your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most famous era of the national assembly between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s BSN there were up to 17 teams in the season.
What are you still doing?
There were things I wanted to do, for example, to regionalize smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponce play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in national playoffs.
Now guys travel and play too much, and that's too much.
At least, I see the fruits of compulsory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It brings me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, I watch music videos of my age on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and I'm going to basketball games.
And, of course, I am enjoying my wife's company, Icabel, who was always with me.
Death of actor Larry Hegman
Larry Hegman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his main role as John Ross Yuing, more known as "J.R.", in the Dallas television series, where he became a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hegman, whose role as oil magnetist J.R. Yuing in the Dallas teleserie, became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hegman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday evening because of the complications caused by cancer, according to the family statement provided for The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas production studio.
"Larry came back to his favorite hometown of Dallas, playing again the flag that he liked the most," his family said.
The Larry family and the closest friends were with him in Dallas on the anniversary of Thanksgiving.
Linda Grey, his wife's burning role in the original series and in the cycle, was next to Hegman when he died in Dallas, her representative, Jeffrey Lane, told her.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, kind, and talented, and I'm going to miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," said Grey in a statement.
Hegmen was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a heart attack and was transplanted.
Long before Dallas, Hegman got to know on TV, thanks to the role of an easy-to-use "I Dream of Jeannie", which was broadcast by NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl-jinna who plays Barbara Eden, and begins to live with her under one roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the cinema included the roles well-recognised by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But that's what his master's interpretation of the amazingly disgusting J.R. led Hegman to the top of glory.
The CBS drama series on the Yuingov clan and other characters in its surroundings took place in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?", designed to create a forest around the episode, full of emotions in which Hegman's character is not being killed, has generated international discussions and millions of dollars that were at risk in bookstores.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the show at the time.
When the answer to the November 1980 episode was given, an average of 41 million TV viewers looked at it and turned Dallas into a second-of-view entertainment program in history, after the end of the "MASH" in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R., Christine (in pursuit of Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. prevented her and then threatened her that she would be charged with prostitution if she did not get out of the city, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hegman played Yuing as an unpopular corrupter with charismatic smiles: an dishonest businessman and an unfaithful husband who wanted his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Grey), to be treated.
"I know what to be on J.R." said Hegman in 1988.
It must be said, "This is where the honest citizen J.R. Yuing will rest."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Principal, as well as the hero of the original series, remembered Hegman on Friday as someone "great both on and off the screen".
He never forgets and never changes for millions of readers around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who have been happy to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas release were shown several months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The five episodes of the second season were already completed and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made statements about what will happen to the series after Hegman's departure.
The native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who bluffed in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he was born in 1931 during his marriage to lawyer Ben Hegman.
He was happy at the New York theaters in the early 1950 ’ s and then served in the UK VHS from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met with young Swedish artist May Axelson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Haydi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't include anything there that would be able to hurt anyone or affect them in any way," he said to the Press Association at the time.
After transplanting the liver, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients who were fearful.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be all right."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course begins to study "The End of the Light"
Every week, students study apocalypse, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this summer, when the professor of religion, Stuart Sharme, decided to read a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an inexhaustible appetite: the end of the "long return account" of the May calendar, December 21, for which many people were caught as evidence of the end of the world.
But Sharme had no idea what was expected of him in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call the "long-armageddon" and the growing conflict where Israel is affected, where Christian theorists eventually believe that Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharme told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If we were to analyze what's happening in the world right now, as if we had only 30 days left, that was really a good time.
And remember, it's bad for those who have an apocalyptic form of thought.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the theme of "the end of the light" in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Walker is reading the course entitled Media, Culture and the End of the World.
Every week, students study apocalypse themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We'll analyze why these ideas are being circulated over time," he said, and the way in which hypothetical scenarios are being proposed that trigger certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war can break out.
This month, the students analyzed films on apocalypse topics and studied how they relate to real - life examples.
"I've tried to tell the students that it's probably unlikely and impossible," Walker said.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of the History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amar Solari, Associate Professor of the History of Art and Anthropology, joined to read a course called "The End of the Light".
"We don't add '2012' to always have the opportunity to read the course again if the end of the light doesn't come," said Restall.
Despite the “necessary destruction”, students should learn, prepare projects and submit their final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be held in the Canon of Apocalypse, which does not leave students with a different choice, except to work “until the very night that is likely to end the world”, Restall said.
Courses have become quite popular.
"Places are over in two hours," Restall said about his course for students with a high middle degree, where 35 students were enrolled.
We received e-mail messages many weeks before the beginning of the semester from people who asked if there were any more places.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic form of thought, light or religion, is just a matter of comfort or lack.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student at the Psychology and the Sisters Department, said he was watching all the apocalypse movies.
"I've never heard of a course that would teach this," he remarked.
I like him.
But none of the students in question - no longer talking about the professor - said that he believed in the date of the end of the light on 21 December.
"Our first project affected Mayan's prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old final student at the Temple University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it was just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there was apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which spanned several centuries, where people responded to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused these speculations to increase.
"People in other places don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dodgerty, professor of religion at La Sal University, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew of any course on "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not take part in the end of the world," he wrote, pending the order of the higher court.
We have an apology from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that for a long time it had been said about many days of the last court, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or to imagine that 21 December was the beginning of the seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are safe to date.
Some say they're going to the party "the end of the light."
"I may call someone from my friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old college student.
