In Herson, people went to the meeting again, and the Russians didn't get away with it.
As participants told the agency, the Hersons were able to hold a meeting until the military rhp with the technique came to the scene.
"We've made it to the meeting. Now there's the rf technique," said one of the participants in the event.
In the past, the citizens were traditionally gathered for protests in the area of Freedom, near the ODA building and the suburbs.
Like the building, this area is controlled by armed Russian troops who use weapons against the rallyers and steal people.
On April 3, Russian armed troops reportedly used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kahovka.
According to Ukrainfort, the people regularly protest the Russian attacker’s peaceful actions against the daughter.
Russian troops use force and weapons against humans, are wounded and detained.
Russian predators also steal the locals.

It would be better if we were forced to move, because we don't make the European prices financially.

Maybe we can switch with Vale, and in the morning, and I'll be after dinner?
Mom's gonna live here in a dumpster, just like the pay here is a little for a dumpster.
It's important that I have a place to live.
Sasha was not at school today, and I wrote to the teacher on mail.
Hi, I'm sick, so it's better to take our meeting to the next exit, I'm sorry.
I can cook, especially for the recipe, but I like to cook.

It's very well written and convenient.

If Nazar works at 5:30, he can use any train:
Green: Mariupoli, the heart of war, will stop fighting, we will have weak positions
President Volodymir Zelenski believes that battles to the east of Ukraine and, in particular, to Mariúpol, determine the course of war -- and if the U.S.S.A. is defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and reoccupy the occupied territories.
It's like, "Mariupoli is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It's fighting, we're fighting, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have a weaker position.
They (the city's defenders) are the people who drew a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupoli, the stronger our position will be on the east side of the state, in the (region) OAS, and if they are stronger, the table of talks will be closer to us and we will have the advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we can't wait to meet.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to the return even in the cities that we have now deoccupied.
They can go for it.
Then our situation in the struggles will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we do.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory...."
Details: Greeny also said to go to the negotiations after the invasion of Ukrainians is difficult, but "we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if they're in our hands."
It's like, "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
Under our conditions, under the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something -- and I don't think they will be satisfied with any peace on any condition.
But if we don't talk emotionally, the war should end in peace, or millions of victims will end.
And even where millions of victims come to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight, but for life.
You can't fight for the chicken when there's nothing, there's no people."

In connection with the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new quality.
The same analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, state research
Ukrainian poetic metaphors in modern literature allow for the analysis of postmodernistic contexts such as where the metaphor plays the role of axiological criteria

According to Ukraine, this is reported in Facebook by the Ministry of Defence.
"Every Ukrainian must know their names!
GUR MO Ukraine has obtained a list of 64 military personnel of a single motorcycle brigade who are directly involved in the execution of military crimes against the people of Ukraine in Buča," the report goes.
IN THE EARTH, it is noted that for crimes committed against the peaceful population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought before the court and brought to justice.
You can view the list by reference.

In the free cities and villages, the mass killings of Russian civilians have been recorded.
On April 1, Buchi’s city head, Anatolio Fedoruk, reported that 280 people had been buried in the brotherly graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktov stated that on April 3 from the Russian outlaws in the Kyiv territory, 410 bodies of the killed peacekeepers were exported.
On February 24, Russia’s president, Vladimir, announced the start of a full - scale invasion in Ukraine.
Russian predators' troops are shooting and destroying key infrastructures, carrying out massive surveys of Ukrainian cities and forces using artillery, reactive fire systems, ballistic missiles, avibomb.
Good morning, I'm sorry, but I can't work with you because I'm going to fly to Canada as soon as possible.
Right away, there's a formal name, there's a risk of a hair, there's a slender expression, in the curves - a shortcut that's used in the schedule of hours.
I don't want to bother you, relax.
I've been watching the weather forecast.
I don't need brandy.
Just fine clothes at normal prices and sizes.
We were in the store at the railway station.
Professions that are proposed, possible without language?
It's important, if there's such a tradition, I need to know that I'm prepared.
I thought about it a week, but the situation is getting worse.
Tomorrow might be a bad relationship on the road.
I am grateful to each person for his experience, even if he is painful.
I believe that she has gained experience from every situation for herself so as not to repeat the mistakes she has made.
The directives are in the form of numbered written supplements, which are part of this Regulation.
I'm sure that won't be a problem.
In Ukraine, many people likewise celebrate this week.
This depends on faith.
Is there a Greek-Catholic or a Catholic?
At first, you can try it for free
Maybe you'll write us a salary algorithm, we'll pay ourselves.
We have the paper that children get at the end of the school year, it's a table, and they get a witness at birth and married.
Yeah, he's on it as an experienced driver, but I don't know if it's better.
It says that you have to fill out the life story, in Czech...
I'm trying to make it.
A friend doesn't get angry that you're on the phone
In my daily prayers, I thank God and the Goddess for you.
Let them cover you with their warm love and affection for you this night.
My heart belongs to you.
Don't you mind if I come right after the war?
Location, day, and time will be specified according to interests and possibilities
We promised that when you go to school, we'll bring you a surprise.
It was great, I have money for two months of rent, the Olomouca area doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of animal abuse from the civilian population north of Kiev.
The photos of the victims and the people who were shot confused the entire civilized world.
Tens of people question each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?
And it didn't surprise me at all, that's what happened to me with sadness and I was waiting for...
I took out children and elderly parents from Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls and friends with the kids, and then they just went back to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have been consistently helping the U.S.A., and I have no doubt that in the case of the occupation of the advantage of Kiev, my family will not be spared.
Because I was still absolutely sure that the essence of the dirty Communist-KDBist regime remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, he just can't exist, he's built on terror.
In 1937 one of my ancestors was shot in the prison of the city of Vitomir.
A few years ago, a copy of the Grinding Case was given to the GST: The whole case is over a hundred pages, and the sentence of death is very simple and even more terrible.
The defendant was illiterate, he denied the charge.
The ethnic pole, the Catholic, had five children, was of the free people, the poor "one-door" path, never walked in the cracks.
The fact that they lived on the highways and had several cows was sufficient to supply the caretaker and the baby’s anniversary to the death.
The parents did not even know where to bury.
Grandma said that about a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give a false witness.
In the criminal case, there's the name of the Shari hitter.
Our former speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics, and I'm not surprised if his family was the KDBist informant.
Apple from the apple, as it is known, falls...
The brutal triad that led to the loss of the peasants was ethnic Russians.
In an analysis of the case, he was interested in various information sources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia, such as the Undead Barack, which are of great importance to the events of those years.
Thus, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NCSDs have found ways to punish and destroy almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves were victims of Stalinist repression and publicly wrote the names of the killers, the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It's like the computer found files with child pornography, they put her in jail, and she died fast.
The CDB is now killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the past century.
What do you suddenly wonder about their actions now?
It focuses on the most debased characteristics of human nature.
Over a thousand-year-old ordinal tradition, slavery and imperialism were imposed in the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then, over what happened, they did an animal genetic experiment, cutting intelligence over a few minutes of red terror.
Look at the semi-French movie "Czechist" in 1992, that's what it was.
You saw my picture in the bathroom.
Can you ask my wife what I can buy from the cough?
I'm sorry I don't have to ask.
I still wanted to ask you maybe you know where the kids went, because Gala can't sign them.
Igor asks if you'll be comfortable to go tomorrow? (he's out and can't go because the car hasn't been seen at the station today.)
It's not easy for us to worry so much about you.
You are very helpful, thank you!
In the city of Borodjana, under Kiev, a body of 7 civilians was discovered in two multifloor - roofed homes.
Mariupola’s defenders claimed that the city of an unknown toxic substance from a Russian pilot would be evicted.
Three people were injured.
In Russian prisons, approximately 1,700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are held.
Among them are 500 women.
◆ Germany allocates 1 million euros to support the International Criminal Court, which investigates the war crimes of the Russian army in Ukraine.
◆ Canada has imposed sanctions on 33 Russian defence companies.
In the past, one enemy tank, three drones, three artillery systems, 24 motor vehicles, one helicopter, and three unmanned aircraft were destroyed in battles east of Ukraine.
Your coffee will be here today.
I've got my first bike after my son.
When do girls return from their schooling?
We came to a place where we settled from the center in pardubice, good conditions.
But there's a big one, but here men live like drinking alcohol and smoking in the living room, loud music is the least that "smooth" is, the smell of cigarettes drinking men and we and the kids... are scared to sleep if they're honest.
Please help with the house, for money please.
But that's where it's safe and not burned.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is such that they smoke right here.
I'm asking you very much, one of them is almost on his feet, something is screaming, something he doesn't like.
I'm just asking if you can help.
The main thing that we understood one another
Very positive, such a beautiful garden, such happy educators.
You do so much for us, it's amazing, thank you very much.
Good evening, Stephanie, Agatha wants to take part in the game, she's out of the game.
We're missing the bow.

How do I get to the apartment today to clean up?
How will I be at the main entrance, and will you open?
I wanted to go somewhere else to watch a cake for Karen.
I forgot to write to you, I'm sorry.
Everything went very well yesterday.
We talked about children with a special need for you and their training system in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shawwa introduced me as an employee of the Fpoint, the first question was how to find a dog, how to find a mop.
All follow the Facebook page.
They asked to greet you and tell you that they were very interested in reading the news.
They're still talking about people of Roman nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And they agreed that if the child and the parents don't understand the Czech at all, after work, I can help them by phone.
I need to change the tablecloth, 2 sets.
It's what I get on the holidays.
I have a free time, and we're just going to the grand ceremony.

The data was very enjoyable, thanks to the organization
So in Nestor until only a nightmare and in Galinka temperature 37.7 at night 38
General Chapek's going there very slowly.
There's a chance for everyone.
Above all, love is real and mutual.
I don't know how in Europe, but in our country people get married for a variety of reasons, mostly for useful, mercenary purposes.
And I have a problem with that if I don't love a man, he won't do anything.
Yes, we took her home and took her away right away.
She was very grateful, and she was crying.
I told her about you and how you helped the Ukrainians.
The tears were in her eyes.
I said if that could be some old blanket and pillow.
But that's not necessary, only if it is, and I'm very grateful to you, too.
I was really sorry about him.
In front of him, they killed my best friend.
I had many questions to ask God about why things were happening in my life, and I just had to worry about everything.
I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go, and you made the congregations.
It's like that, but we're not going around in the area and we don't know where everything is. We've been looking for an hour and we've been back in the supermarket.
Even now, I thought about you, and you wrote to me.
Does your dad just have the ability to communicate in Russian or some other family member?
It's possible for the kids to come to Vale and play in the lobby.
All right, then let's risk:)
I'm glad to meet you, too.
The house was talking to Voldomir, and I was glad to wait for them to find out or to look for themselves. The ladies who live with us said we should go to the metro station there is a facility that helps find the house.
I'm going to break the barrier for a little bit.
I didn't know the answers to some of their questions.
So be good on Thursday, if possible.
I can't call a doctor because I haven't done a food license check yet.
But I can't call him because I'm done with the money.
I can't fill the phone because I don't understand it in Czech online banking, and from a Ukrainian bank card, it doesn't fill in.
In addition, I can't change the tariff so that I have normal calls and the Internet or fill out the number.
I'm out of my mind.
Where's the pass, and the face... the title doesn't sound right, what do you mean?
I’m ashamed to be without work
She just wrote that at school.
I'm sorry I was worried. I was worried.
But it's closer than they'll leave the border of Ukraine to know exactly what they're coming for.
Because there's a question in life right now.
Yes, the size of 10-11 years, but our sizes don't match.
I'm looking for everything for the house and the kids.
Thanks to people I've been accepted alive in the chapel they're always asking if I need a shot and I'm ashamed to say I'm asking myself to find it.
I just came home, I'm having breakfast:)
Don't explain anything, please do what I don't have.
Unable to answer without a summary
Mom, I can't tell you this:)
And I really don't think right now that she couldn't keep herself from feeling before we left the apartment... like tonight....
Let the God of Yura go to sleep, and then I'll lie down and get some sleep.
I'll write to you anyway.
Hey, Susana, help me. I'm getting paid in March. It's for two of us with July or just me, I can't figure out why it's worth it.
Yes, you can take copies of passports when you're comfortable :)
We have one of the best planes in the area.
It’s a pleasure to talk to you, and you enjoy it.
I went to karitas, where I was offered a temporary home for a week -- two but I need a permanent home where I could be with a child, and why there's less and less.
Flowers have been planted. It's okay. Everybody's resting and very nice.
As the European truth reports, the world writes with reference to sources in the government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economic Affairs on Saturday.
The value of 100 chubbys, including the educational set and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As well, the hoods in the BTR Boxer version are also proposed for 1.2 billion euros.
While fighting tanks have to pick up relatively close to the enemy’s target, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire more than 20 miles [30 km] away.
According to the Ukrainian government circle with reference to the KMW proposal, the provision of auto-invasion cages will go through a circular scheme.
In the shortest term, the Bundeswer will give China 100 of its shells, and the gaps that have been created will then be filled with industry at the second stage.
The first new hoods can be installed 30 months after the contract was signed, the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed by 2027.
And this is the first half of the day, or the second half of the day together?
Thank you.
I'm going to work tomorrow without the commission, and then when my doctor heals I'm going to go to the commission I'm sure I understand?
How can I change my T-Mobile tariff package for 4 gigabytes for 249 kroner now?
Hi, I'm sorry, do you want to know if you need a worker?
Maybe the floor of the laundry or the dishes.
I don't know Ukrainian for bad language, but I need work.
I'm young and active, I'm 21 years old.
I'll agree to any work.
I speak Czech at the basic level, but I'm learning every day, so I think I'm going to study everything that's needed to work without problems.
Something I promised you today, you must be sleeping to work tomorrow.
If I can, I'll take these pants for work.
You're smart and you'll be all right. Take rest, get strength and beauty with a strong sleep!

Was It Designed?
That's how we wanted to solve the question with the card to Easter. We don't have the Internet banking, we don't know how to fix it.
To the Lord in whom do we live?
Always apologize when you're leaving.
Yeah, we can do it after 17 years.
Can I clean up my underwear in the apartment tomorrow and put it in the garage?
Yes, I'll be waiting for you in six hours.
How Many Learned From This Specialty
If it was warm, it would be very good.
I've made an online application.
We're all good. We're dealing with sand, we've got experience in Ukraine with gas, but as it's very expensive, we've been burning sand with trees.
Hello, Lena, please tell us where the office store is nearby.
Tomorrow we're going to Prague to look at the apartment.
It All Has Been Solved
I have to take Karinka with me.
I put up a towel, I came home and said that there's a writing on the table near the door of the repair shop can be sent, if you need to remove the towel.
It says that my status will change for 24 hours, but why?
The former man can't calm down, he's writing me a real drama.
How do I want anything that officially connects us to him as soon as possible?
Thank you for something we don't have very much out here.
And we've even already got stuff from the tails.
I'm sorry. I'm confused.
I didn't understand Czech so well then.
I must have thought of something.
It's true that they go to school like that three because Gala and St.
Tell me how to get to the city center.
I'll share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is the secret of two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A man and a woman decide their own questions in their family, especially without the participation of their relatives.
Can we be together?
It'll take a while before we're around.
Why Not Try This Way
I rented a car for 9 people, we'll come with Mariana and your family.
How much time do you have?
Yeah, I'm glad to hear jazz.
Thanks to this application, we've been talking about it in Czech courses on the Wednesday.
For the past four years, I have not allowed anyone to touch me, read many books about philosophy, and studied in my own book.
When they make you very painful, it's hard to trust you.
But you have to try again, everyone is going through something that changes it forever, it's life.
Martin, we're sleeping.
Thank you for such a nice and happy day.
We enjoyed it very much.
We feel like we are in our family.
The children spent the whole night telling Dad, Grandma, and Grandpa how well they were with you.
From the girls to the best wishes of us for the holidays.

Is there any improvement in the coronavirus?
Thank you very much for helping people.
We're in the weak now, we've been harassed by our friends for an hour.
My family: a man, a daughter, a son of 11.
The man has found the job as a driver.
I'm a massager, a rehabiant looking for a job.
In order for the children to attend school, and I could work, we needed a home not far from civilization.
I just had to give up today!
I didn't know that even big stores would be closed.

Lydia has already been taken to school, but because of the illness, we're going to go to school on Tuesday. I told you today.
I sit, I keep my ears shut, I listen to music, and I think about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, honey, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I'm going to act like we're together.
I would say that after the war there will be a lot of work.
So I'm not afraid I can't find her there.
I know a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what to do with the house.
I need to go through the food license exams, can I do this for you?
Please inform us that tomorrow at 5 guests will prepare the apartment.
Five places I understand so much in the TV room?
To lay down and bury the sofa?
Can we stop by until Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to live?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new one that's already been used, but it's a job but it's not necessary.
Write the address in Czech, let's look at the map where it's from us.
I don't know how much free space there is so I can't plan anything with furniture this week wants to look at that apartment and then understand what furniture I need.
I'm sorry she answered so long, it was a working day, it's hard to adapt
That's enough?

Kiss you in the morning, tell me how you feel.
For the child, there's already a bed and a bathroom, things have been found for the first time.

I'm just gonna be a little bit later at 8:00, okay?
I don't want to misunderstand you.
Because I'm worried that everything's okay!
Because we didn't even talk about it with these excursions!
I understand how important this is for you!
And I'm silent about myself (for me, it's just the top you can't reach)!
How do you feel today?
Hi, I'm sorry, I just woke up, I slept badly.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was disappointed that we and Cole had begun to translate the test badly yesterday.
I will ask whether Gregory Denisenka or Yonascheka) to help me with my mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be useful to them, too?
If that's possible, I want to draw mathematical terms for the outputs.
The geometry is quite complex, but we have to work with Cole so that there's no error.
Thank you for the test job.
We too look forward to that.
And so she is very happy with any gift
I wanted to connect to my Czech number
Yesterday at the 402 bus stop, I met Ukraine, Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she herself... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay out of sight.
Now we have arranged to be friends.
And last night, I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine where my heart was touched.
Philia in Hall No29 is dedicated specifically to supplying and processing applications for assistance
I found out I ordered a backup card.
No, I'm just a man.
So she wouldn't be afraid of anyone coming.
I didn't go, I did, I did, I did, I could do that, the main thing that you taught me how to turn the trigger on.
So you've been out of town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Holocaust Center, Babin Yar, in Kiev, we were honored with 80 years of mass shooting by the German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yar.
I had the honour to speak after three heads of state, including the president of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We have to protect this base -- it's also part of our responsibility to our history."
If "evil demons of the past appear in new clothes today," he said, "for us Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight must last."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of peacekeepers, starved the city’s inhabitants and allowed them to die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually so as to remind them of the shootings in Babi Yaru.
More than a month ago, the Germans see this in the news in real time.
Yes, Germany implements sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, and weapons that have not been so long before.
Germany withdraws the supply of heavy weapons to Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to speak against the whiskers.
This means combating all possible means of mass murder, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way to conquer evil without risk and victims and stop the beliefs that are taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night
We agree, plan for a trip, and write down when we meet
All the people who were sick only Lydia did not have a new micron
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
I use this talent instead of kar

Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership ceased to be a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were opposed to NATO entry and only 18% of respondents spoke "for".
After the revolution of Hyde, the escape of Victor Yanukovic, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the Donbasi war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and the number of supporters, on the other hand, grew.
After the beginning of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record of Ukraine's support for NATO membership among Ukrainian citizens, more than 75%.
Despite Ukraine's support for NATO's accession and NATO's assistance under the conditions of war, there are now many criticisms on the Alliance and the members of the country -- for the lack of timely weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to "drive" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to refuse membership in the Alliance by the position of the FF if it can stop the war and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including the military.
In the new episode of the "Cloud Question" and the editor of the "European Truth" we talk about how Ukraine's Alliance has helped since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticised for, and why Alliance is criticised in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is as close as ever in history, and why the security guarantees discussed in the talks with Russia can become another Budapest memorandum.
What do you think this is?
I've got a partner in the volt that's my application for consideration.
I gave it to her because of this mobile plug-in.
There are no visas, we need to go to the convention center and learn how to do this, because they formed it in Poland, there were no visas there, and there were no passports.
We'll have to write to you!
Dennis went in a good mood today.
He agreed to meet a young man from Ukraine he met yesterday at school to show him everything.
So I hope he's all right.
Because I don't like it, it's not long enough.
In Ukraine it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tankers to Ukraine and fighting machines to flee
I'm going to leave my children alone there for 3-4 years and I'm going home because I can't leave anymore.
And brothers with you at 6-7 in the morning
Yes, it was a sick heart.
I had a real feeling about this man, but he did not do very well, and I left him.
After a while, he returned and apologized to me.
I refused him.
Then, after a while, he phoned what had been done to him in his heart.
He asked me to just talk to him, and I felt bad about him.
I was psychologically supportive of him for almost half a year.
During that time, we had a lot of conversations.
I had problems at the same time at work.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought maybe I should really look at him differently.
And he offered to marry me, and two days later he died.
So God himself decided our fate.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he's only talking in Czech.
I wanted to say that I was able to find a home, and I am so happy to have a place to live and to be with a baby.
Did you need to remember me before?
() Because I helped to look at the children in the family.
Don't apologize, just write what you didn't understand.

God is never late, all his time and place.
I don't think he wants to bury me:)
I understand perfectly the price of unqualified work, and I understand that the kind of work I had at home in Kiev I can't have and the money I made at home, and I won't get here right now.
But just sit down and don't do anything I can't do, because then all the bad thoughts in my head lie down, so you have to do something physical.
At the airport, documents are made from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and at other times you can just wait.
Volodymir came back at 4:00 a.m.
That's why we took them to us.
We slept with Vic in the kitchen, put them in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and go to the airport with them.
When he's with you, write it down and you'll find out what's next...
And then I can't find a place anymore.

But that's my opinion.
She's from my uncle's house, she's given the roles and the board for the party, and she's in the house, so that's what she's got.
I got up at 9 a.m., and I'm just cooking breakfast now.
I'm very ashamed that you're communicating with me in your exit, and I hope I'm not very nervous.
We want to notify you of the change in location and provide documents for the continuation of the map
We're giving all the hospitals in our country now.
And I forgot to tell you there's gonna be a temptation tomorrow.
One mother said that it would be better for the kids to have a baby with a wig.
He's coming to you for a visit.
Please tell me, but do you have an approximate schedule of cleaning the apartment for a month ahead, although for an approximate understanding in which days?
I don't remember this schedule.
The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say, "They haven't done that before."
The direct language of Konashenko is, "Let's see the attempts to diversify and strike Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the FF.
If such cases persist, the RF armed forces will strike the decision-making centres, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army had previously been held."
Russians have been causing rocket strikes in Kiev since the first days of a full-scale invasion of the RF's occupying forces in Ukraine.
The 25th February of the Russian missile crashing the Ukrainian WHO system crashed into a multi-quarter building on the city’s Poznak.
On February 26, Russia’s missile was involved in a multifaceted project by Valeria Lobanovski.
On March 1, the Russians took part in a television program on the Roads near Granny Yaru, resulting in the death of five passersby.
On March 2, Ukraine's WTO systems hit the South Railway Station, Russian rockets flying toward the Ministry of Defence building.
March 14th, the crash of the shell rockets broke the house and trolleybus on the Kurenev in Kiev
On March 18, the Russian missile hit the vineyard in Vinogradari, where one man died, another 19 people were injured, including four children.
On March 21, the Russian rockets were destroyed by a modern Metro Retroville on Vinogradari, resulting in at least 4 deaths.
On April 13, the mayor of Kiev, Vitaly Klicko, claimed that the city was evacuated by the inhabitants of the capital who had been evacuated from the city until they returned in the morning.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still cause rocket strikes in Kiev, as well as many mines and unresolved ammunition in the capital areas.
The chief intelligence officer of the Ministry of Defence warned on 12 April that the Russians are planning the first series of attacks on the territory of the RF in order to accuse Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1 at Belgrade in Russia, the oil base exploded as if it were a result of an air raid by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, Belgrade's local government claimed that the "Ukraine missile" had fallen near the city.
Clearly, elites in Washington and Berlin are throwing themselves into cold pits from the very thought that Nazi destroyers will destroy Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But the Greens do not speak to them as much as to their voters and societies in general.
By his talks in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the major cities of Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that none of his predecessors have been available.
Greenish does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he believes in this European nation that those politicians choose.
And these discourses, this brilliant power drop, sensitivity, and time of despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Byden categorically opposes the closure of the sky, 70% of its members are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are opposed to speeding up Ukraine’s entry, this process is already in progress.
I understand you, so you don't want us to be fooled.
The money you collect is better than giving to people who need more.
I can come to you and we'll decide where I want to help.

More precisely, today I'm just asking for attention.
I want to say a lot today, so I ask you to have more patience.
Are you all right with your imagination?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan purchases, vacations.
You have a dream.
You're going to buy the dress you saw yesterday at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can't understand that.
He's smacking for the old reality.
You're calling at work, knowing if you're going out to work today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
As long as it's clear.
There's hope... it's not for long.
Now... let's make a deal... something's gonna happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go? I don't have anybody and nowhere.
I've got $50 in my purse, and we've spent everything we've ever spent at home.
Many of those who were found by the leaders did not pay a wage for our work.
Where do I go? Who do I need? How do I get my kids? Where do I live?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't get anything out of the house... you'd be walking 1,000 kilometers.
You don't know how to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you load children all over Prague.

If that's the same type, I'll see.
Please send a page with a visa or a visa mark (red with a date).

Mrs. Libush, did you pay for that?
Because I can't understand.

We owe you... thank you!
Yeah, I understand that's very good.
I'm going to take you a picture of the lady I'm teaching English.

You're busy tomorrow, don't you want to meet after 4:00?
What's your overall impression from the first week?
Carina brought us drugs last night, and we drink them.
I can work with bedridden and disabled children.
But I have to say that I only speak Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have that.

Today we have joy - our town of Bucha has been freed from the siege, our troops have been spared.
They're looking for Russians in the basements and in the apartments.
The whole city has been replaced, the elimination will begin.

Diano, whatever you want, maybe he'll be ashamed, I don't know.
Our boss wants to stay home, says he's tired of us and wants to be alone when we're going somewhere without him.
We're going to blow up the masculine and do the lessons.
These are small businesses that preached volunteer headquarters in their homes and shops.
It's the tractors that actually go under the shots in the field, because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who today agree to go in the rubber vans in temporarily occupied areas to get help there and get the people out of there.
They are heroic leaders who, without fear, go into the fighting zone, calm down and help the fugitives in the wagons, and at peace stations, they help the volunteers to load the humanitarian car.
These were the drivers standing on the Vitomir Trail on the first day of the war, and they patiently served the frightened and upset people.
They are the Communals that take out garbage, repair pipelines, and power lines to ensure that people are needed.
They are doctors and nurses who save people for 24 hours a day, not complaining about anything, but in a free moment still volunteering to collect pills on the front.
In us in Ukraine, the silk stops when the little ones are leaves)
Say, please, little children-- what age do you mean?
My daughter, 8 years old, is that acceptable?
I'm looking for a place with my daughter for 3-4 days to come to the Czech Republic and transfer passports to build a visa in Canada.
In Warsaw, there's a lot of people in the business center and they don't work online.
I wanted to come one day, but this is far away, taking a long time on the road, the child would be hard.
So she decided to search for a place in Prague or near it.
No, we're all set.

Nothing, I'll get used to the new reality.
I'm very unhappy and I want you to know that.
You can edit the post, and the most important thing is to be true.
Yes, TV is full of this.

Now I'm on the phone with all the people I know from Lviv, and a lot of people are dead.
The Czech Republic began to issue visas after March 22, my turn.
Before that time -- put the stamps like this and then compared these to the visa
The Ukrainian Foreign Elections District (KWO Ukraine) is a electoral district which unites the electoral units located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of polling facilities in Ukrainian embassies and consulates and military bases abroad,[Vinoska 1] on which Ukrainian peace-building contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) are located.[1] The role of the district electoral commission for the Ukrainian Electoral District is carried out by the Central Electoral Commission.
In the Ukrainian electoral district, only public elections are held: elections of the President and of the People's Members and of the All-Ukraine referendums.
Local elections do not take place in the U.S.
They're at the station near the mother's and the baby's room.

Are you mad at me?
I'm going to take a photo in the bathroom.
I don't need money anymore. I borrowed a friend for a long time.
I wanted to say that I already connected the Czech cell phone number.
So I didn't need another device, I went to operator O2 and they made me an electronic SIM card that I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
Thank you. I'm not very comfortable, I work Sunday and I can't anymore.
You said you had a broken dirty car, take it for yourself, and you need it very much.
We don't have enough blankets, smoke blankets, a plate.
Good morning, I'm going to go out at 10... write again the address where the text is missing.
I don't want to torture you or myself, I'm going to get stuck with this.
So that would be good, but I know there was no room, and in principle they now have all the lessons on schedule and they're teaching pretty well.
Do you have a moustache to make pie?
Let's have a good afternoon.
Did your mom tell you something hurt yesterday?
She can't tell them what she wants, and she doesn't understand what they're saying.
She went to school today too.
Today I saw Christine’s mother, but she didn’t even say hello.
A very delicious apple, what sort of an apple?
The head of the Office of President Andrey Jermak announced that Russia is starting a "faicious operation" with regard to the weapons that the allies are handing over to us.
The direct language of Jeremiah: "They understand that they are losing the war, seeing their distance, and desiring to "kill" weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last fairy tales is the destruction of Slovene C-300.
This information has already been clarified by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What's next, we know Russian scenarios, I'll call one of them.
They can launch feikas that Ukrainian soldiers bout with weapons from the allies, and it's massively going into the Russian army's arms.
I want to warn you right away.
Because the weapons in the hands of U.S. soldiers are exclusively sending the enemy to that world.
I'm sorry, I forgot to ask you how much bulles to cost the garden in a month and will he work the summer?

And I'll do my best to make you happy.
After you wrote to me today, I'm happy.
I hope you're serious about it.

I'm sorry, I didn't completely understand the question.
Didn't you manage to call today because of a change in the price of a mobile operator?
I'm sorry, but I can't expect anyone in this life.
Today, I was offered a job every day.
I'm sorry, but I agreed to work there.
Thank you for having responded and I want to find you a good assistant.

On each of them you have a free offer, a description, a contact with the owner and a photo.
I can't find a contact just by e-mail. Unfortunately, there's nothing going on in me that lives closer to Czech Krumlov and we're now living in Prague.
Then I won't help you, there's no chance in Brno.
Thanks for the help, we found a home, but we need a bed and a sofa, maybe you can tell us where you can buy a cheap budget because we have a weak budget, thank you very much.

We took the whole room and moved into the second room.
International co-operatives continue to express shock and resentment after the evidence that the Russian forces have committed atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these messages as a “provocation. ”
"The news of the killed, raped and severely injured Russian troops of Ukrainian peacekeepers is worth the conviction," New Zealand Prime Minister Jasind Ardern told reporters in Wellington on 4 April.
"Rossia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, saying that her government is discussing additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kissed called incidents "a violation of international law".
Statements were made after reports of hundreds of peacekeepers being shot and thrown into brotherly graves or left on the streets of the suburb of Kiev, in Buchi by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
Photos of the bodies of civilians who were killed with their hands were shocked by many and called for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
The president of France Emmanuel Macron announced in a radio interview on 4 April that there are signs that Russian troops have committed "war crimes" in Buchi.
"What happened in Buchi requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," said Makron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed towards Russian coal and oil exports.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanches of Spain stated that Russian troops could go so far as to do "genocide" in Buchi.
"We will do everything we can so that those who have committed these war crimes will not remain innocent," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on public television later on 3 April, Russia’s M.S.S.S. spokesman Maria Zaharov rejected the charge as a “provocation. ”
Without evidence, she stated that the United States and NATO had "ordered" images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these claims were made in the first minute after these materials appeared does not raise any doubt about who "provided" this story," Zaharova said.
Formerly, Russia's Minopause also stated that Buchi's image is “one more regime of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops left the city until March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4th to discuss what it called "the provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Buchi.
On April 4, Russia's next committee issued a statement declaring "research" on charges of Ukraine's spreading "inadvertently false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Buchi.
The president of Ukraine, Volodymir Zelenski, spoke on 3 April, accusing the Russian troops of committing genocide in the city, and told the Kremlin leaders that they had to come to Buchi to see what they had done to their troops.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out," said the Greens on video, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for the shooting in the poultice," he said.
He claimed that Russia's President Volodymir Putin and the Russian troops should be responsible for the military action in Ukraine.
"I don't understand when we find people in the back of their hands and their heads down," he said about the scene of the victims scattered on the streets of Buchi, about 35 kilometers north-west of Kiev.
On April 2nd, the Ukrainian newspaper Freedom reported on the streets of a small city of the body, like civilians.
Only in one place did the correspondent see up to 10 bodies on the street.
The AP journalists saw at least 21 people in different locations in Buchi.
The bodies of one group of nine people -- everyone in the civilian -- were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to locals, used Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed from a distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities stated that at least 410 peacekeepers were found in the Kyiv area, which had been controlled by the Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, everything is, we bought everything on the list.
"They told them that Kiev was gone." How the crews drove the Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
Russian invasions in Ukraine are accompanied by horrific acts of robbery, rape, murder, torture.
In this list, there is another item that is now much less information — the export of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
About mid-March, the Russian crew of Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements on their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-declared President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military force.
"Ukraine truth" has been looking for exported Ukrainians and their relatives to inquire about how the evacation itself is happening and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
This text has now been applied to a voluntary evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and inadvertently.
Luckily, they're alive and maintaining a relationship with the family.
However, in view of the Ukrainian authorities’ statements, many citizens were deported to Russia and Belarus under a strict obligation.
So in Melitopol, the Russians stole the staff of the second sex home, drove the children out of there without their parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of a dead Ukrainian champion from sailing Joseph Zacchinski.
The Aleksandra family, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter, Vali, moved to Hostmel in a few months to war.
Alexander himself got a job at Antonov Airport, which is 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled in the territory of the military city, although it was civil.
As true plastics, Dennis and Marina had gathered anxious bags in advance, but in the morning of February 24th, they didn't make it.
They didn't have their car, and the domestic buses didn't take anyone anymore.
About 12 o'clock on February 24th, they saw the helicopters with Latin V, followed by the first missiles.
One of them was involved in a neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks until March 17th, until the Russian troops drove them to Belarus.
In their basement, about 40 persons were buried.
Not all of them decided.
"On the sixth night of February 24th, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian came to the podium.
They ask, "Who is there?" "I say so." "Come out!"
They were looking for me, asking who was in the basement if there was a weapon.
All the men were asked if they were serving in the army.
They said to the women, "We have come to protect you by order of Ramzan Kadiro."
It was a Chechen OMON, not even an army, young boys of the year 25-35.
They said, "When the Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sasko Billy (commanded by UNA-UNSO's Nationalist Movement Viking, who fought on behalf of the Chechens in the first Russian-Czech War, the U.P.), we're now helping you."
On the third day, they asked us what we needed.
We say that the water was a big problem with her.
They broke up the store, took the goods from there under the "althought of the Russians" and brought us six bottles.
There's still a video on the Internet where kids thank Kadir for the food.
So they brought the cowboys in after the shop was robbed, and they said, "We understand it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmatovic."
Nobody particularly wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child says, "You have 7 days to give up our phones," they laughed.
Still, they kept separate from the Russians.
They said how good they came, because they didn't want war, and the Ukrainians were always good, and they said, "Potiny is a traitor, Cadirov, too, but we can't do anything, because there's our families."
And mostly, they didn't fight, and they drove to grab stores, and they were getting tired.
The Kurds got caught, tied to one leg of a Georgian stick, and to the other, their white hook, and called it a "cold."
In Ukraine, they were not fully prepared.
I don't know how their investigation worked... when they were shot at Buchi, so they didn't even take the killed, they asked us, "What do you have, artillery?"
More than that, we had contrived loopholes, which we didn't know each other, and on the first day, they asked for passwords to find out who they were or what they were.
They were with us until March 13th, after which the Russian OMON arrived, and behind them is a German dessert.
They put 30-40 units of technology between the houses -- ours were constantly falling into it with the "Biraktars."
But these came and told us that the U.S.A. is no longer available, but there are Azovs, and, according to them, Azova is so thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
"Cyev has already given up" was asking since the beginning of March.
One day, a Russian officer, or a dissident, or a FSB representative, came to us and said that there would be evacuation.
And we listened to the radio -- there was about the Bull, the Ghostmel, we thought maybe they gave us the green corridor.
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian commander.
But they say, "You're being taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We're saying we don't want to go there or there.
They said, "So sorry for your children's mentality!"
As it worked out, they dragged us into the basement and started shooting from under the house, either "Grads", or the minimets.
And then it flew back... the neighboring houses just burned down, some of them fell apart.
Our home had a direct impact on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us to Belarus only, promising to hand over to the underpriests and to the Red Cross.
The part didn't go, saying it was for the traitors of the homeland, saying, "You're being shot there, you're being sold to organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road were hot, a broken technique, even though the Belarusians told us that the Russians were driving them right away.
There are a lot of Copionaires, buried technology, and soldiers.
We've had improvised control at the White House crossing point, so many people were completely undocumented, because they burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given a cup of tea.
And this is where we hear the gunshots, and it's obvious that it worked on "Iscander" in Kiev.
Although these of the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, they fly, they fly on the edge."
But we're from aviation, we have education, we understand that.
We were later loaded on a bus and taken to the Chunky Sanatorium near Gomel.
His manager, Wenger Vasil Stephanovich, said, "Here I am hiding, I am from Montenegro.
But I understand that Putin and Lucashenk won't stop until these crows are gone.
A poor people is suffering!
And we have Lucashenko so good!
He will say, and it will be.
They offered to interview the Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium administration told us, "You're already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and UN representations (at least they were called) spread disinformation that men cannot go to Poland.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though there was a problem with the documents — the daughter had no foreign passport.
We had to get it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
There was nothing we could do at the Ukrainian Consulate, and in Minsk at the station, they said no one would take a bus without passports.
I'm going to say here that we've been very helpful to the Belarusian volunteers.
We were both settled in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
There was no force in the sanatorium.
Our second group of migration representatives said that you can use the maximum week-five here, because Belarus is not Europe, there is no payment here.
We found an internal carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
As we traveled near Mozira (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border — U.S.A.), we saw the launch of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the rocket is first flying, it shines beautifully, and then it goes off.
People sitting on a bus in Mozira told us that the Russians are constantly shooting from the polygons.
But I can say that the Belarusians don't want to fight at all.
The generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break a son if they called him.
But the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk does not believe at all.
They will say, "You are a people of peace."
They do not realize that their poles are used to shoot Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting for us to be taken to Estonia.
Now we're going to register, we're going to decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are now, as much as Estonians."
Marina lived in the territory of the military town of Hostomela, along with her brother’s family, his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years of age.
In the morning of February 24th, she called the tribes and asked them to gather the most necessary things and documents.
At night they went to the basement of a neighbor’s house.
Marina herself was unable to return home and, in principle, was unable to find a home.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.
And you can't go to the center on Monday?
Thank you, we all have. And we're always waiting for you in the guest room!
Thank you for the deal.
And in this little apartment, there's no Wyfay hunting, mostly on all your questions I'm answering, and now I don't know how to be?
So I'm going to live with two women from Ukraine and their children?
The Koran says: “Even a leaf from a tree falls from its familiarity. ”

Can we decide how much better to do this?
On April 1, Buchi’s city head, Anatolio Fedoruk, announced a joyful message — on March 31, Ukraine’s military released the city from Russian predators.
The next day, the captors were expelled from all over Kiev.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians would feel at this moment was a source of fear and hatred, for at the same time it became known that only one Russian bull was shot at at at least 280 peacekeepers.
They were just killed on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back, some of the killed were minors.
Killed and followed by torture, they found the old village of Motijin Olgu Suhenko, her husband Igorya and son Alexander, stolen on March 23rd.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the brotherly grave, Igoria, in the sewerage.
Both tracers were discovered within 20 km of Kiev by a number of disbanded women trapped in the roof.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go home, nobody's gonna be home.
I ordered a ride from Germany through DHL.
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday, but no one contacted me and no backup was provided, and the DHL site said that the receiver was not available.
So the letter was sent to the post office and the address was given.
How can I take it?
I could be on the river a few times a day too, the river right next to the house, but now I'm very rarely walking, having no time, and sometimes I want to go with my sister.

President Volodymir Zelenski stated that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners were too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, published by the President's Office, writes "European Truth".
"All the equipment, all they're sending, for some kind of equipment it's done late.
So, for example, when we talk about Mariúpol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent of the support, it really is.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said Green.
On the question of, that's enough weapons for Ukraine to make a difference in war, the president said, "No, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a NATO member, it would not be a war, or it would have a different appearance.
"It would otherwise spread, we would have the shoulders of close neighbours, we could fight together.
But I'm sure the war would still not be," he added.
Remember, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised Ukraine a new military aid, which includes a defence engineer and an anti-combat weapon.

He asked me to just talk to him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and thought I might be his toy and I might need his money.
And then he made me a proposal.
"I had a car in my yard, on a crocodile like that, and she was dropping her chests.
And they kept me in the house, then took me to the basement, and there were many people, some 400 people, who had nothing to breathe.
What about the house that you took the picture off?
I haven't really gotten there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already promoted this phenomenon.
The last two videos I'll see when the internet works normally
Is there a dresco on the job or not, or can we walk on what there is?
All right, he'll come over there and get them.
I don't want anything.
I understand that I can't sit with you. I need to work.
I understand, thank you, but we don't need 1+1, and we don't need any Ukrainian TV.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is a presidential, propaganda channel, it's not interesting to me at all.
What happened there at the stop with the man that the police and the fast arrived?
Diana didn't answer me either.
All right, I just need to print the kids' paints, so it's gonna be okay.
But you may need more detailed knowledge of the Czech language.
I'm sure you'll be happy with my job.
In this case, I know a girl who's a Ukrainian, but she's studying in the Czech Republic, especially tourism.
You really don't want to come in for a minute with your kids and your grandmother.
I want you to be with me.
It's really hard to breathe in a foreign country, and every day it's getting more and more wanted to go home.
Mrs. Agatha, if you need this photo, I'll take a picture.
Thank you for trying to make us live here as best we can.
I remember you all your life.
And I'll remember and smile.
So thank you so much for taking a path in the geolocation on the phone so that we can get better soon.

"I'm telling her that the "refurbishment of television and radio receivers" has been pulled over the import details, and friends and acquaintances have been warned not to budge the stranger when they call."
"We've been hiding from all over the war.
As long as it works.
However, in Plamka (P.P.) on the wrist and back paws, it may be from stress, food change, and vitamin deficiency.
The last two reasons have been removed, and here is no stress on me, unfortunately.
The flame, unlike all the worlds, is not heard, is heard, and is blown."
Thanks to Olga's poor hearing and most of her time in her room, her bride month lived in the apartment with her "incognito".
And on April 1st, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"33 days I, as a partisan, lived with her in the apartment.
It was a war hidden from her, and what was next to me was that I would come as soon as possible for a few hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her a receptionist -- she listened four hours, then she sang two hours."
The receiver was always at bedside.
Most of the time the entire room is in its own room.
It doesn't sound like it's allowed me to be insensitive to her.
If I heard the sound of her walkers, I hid in my room.
First, she hid the receiver and the TV from her.
And then she called everyone who was talking to her, and that's 6-7 people.
She asked her to talk to her about anything but war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the very beginning and to the end
It's April 17th -- I've got 2 apartments cleaning :)
Good evening, I didn't think of it:)

A British man who was defending Mariúpol in the U.S. lions says he's willing to surrender to the Russians
A British military officer from the U.S. Navy, who is involved in the fight for Mariúpol, told his friends and family that they were carrying weapons and were going to surrender to the Russian troops.
Source: Aiden Aislin's Twitter page, Britishman who served in the U.S.L.S.A. since 2018, W.V.S. with reference to Aislin's family and friends, Atlas News with reference to the word Aislin's friend who spoke to him
We received a message from him, saying, "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Mariúpol, but we have no choice but to pay tribute to the Russian troops.
We had no food and no ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will be over soon."
Details: Aislyn served in the 36th Special Marine Corps of the U.S. Navy, which participates in the Mariupoli Defence Operation.
The V.V.S. reporters contacted the mother of a military officer named Ann Wood, and she confirmed that her son had told her on the phone that they were planning to look like a polo.
Another military member, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in his last phone conversation, Eislin spoke of plans for their sub-department from the capital.
According to him, the brigade ended up with ammunition and food.
The reporters of Atlas News contacted his friend who said that Aislin's sub-section intends to give up the Russian sub-sections in order not to go without a weapon and a bullet in the hands of so-called "chadriders."
Also in the so - called social media, audio recordings of a telephone conversation were distributed, as it were, in which Aislyn spoke to his well - known American friend, who is planning to go to Ukraine.
Aislyn said that they were trying to get out of the city in civilian clothing, but they failed.
The British once told him that in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent, Nottingemshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in a fight against terrorists called "the Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the U.S.A.L.L. and made a vow.
Aislyn’s friends and close friends were called Johnny, and he was best known for his cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I would also like to know whether we're together or not.
But it's not gonna be easy, you'll have to find him...

Thank you, until you've done so much for us, we're very grateful to you.

One brother in the war in Mariúpolis, another in Zaporizia, and today a man from Kiev, moved to Harkow.
They call every day saying it's all right, and there's someone who knows it, they're not gonna tell the truth at all.
She wanted to come to you, but she wanted to handle some things.
I'll ask my husband tomorrow morning if he'll be there tomorrow.
When you come home, write to me, please, I need to talk to Daniel.
Major attackers for their losses in the fight played full.
He was shot by a teacher named Dmitr Pavlicko, an unknown relative, a young man named Boris Alexander.
Their bodies were thrown into “a deep hole in the earth. ”
The memory of “a dead man stood still in the city. ”
In fact, one of the residents of the area ran from house to house.
On the streets, there's always a body that's been hit by a mob.
And maybe I'll really go after you, and I need you.
3. What will your own activity/activity help you or your friends to better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?

I'm not afraid of work, just as I lived in the village, so I can and I love to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
You have a very interesting tradition, we're going to Christmas like this.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved Bill 7176, which has the title "Towards the realization of a monitoring of potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the field of economics".
It's amazing that, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the field of economics was... the place where members of the board of supervisors and bankers are meeting.
Initiators of the bill believe that the decision making by the supervisory board of the Qywi contract firm can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine’s national security.
We know of a large number of new dangers to the company, but we do not know of any company that has a physical need to hold a supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law was understood to be a great basis for "to endure" all the acquisitions in the difficult reform of post-Revolution of Christianity, including independent supervisory councils, and then to establish manual management.
That was before 2015.
Why do companies keep oversight advice, and who should join them?
More than that, if under the patriotic slogans one harmful bill goes, others can fly tomorrow, for example, the state procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NGO.
Many things can be written for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of war and Bill 7176.
So on February 22, this rule was added to a comparative table of Bill 5397.
In general, the desire to ignore the supervisory counsel in some way has been circulating among some peoples for a long time.
Not for criticism like that, but for the possible consequences of the bill, we will consider the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we'll put our proposals on how to deal with the issue of management of post-war operations.
The first Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such an innovation to lose the Internet and other means of communication that would make it possible for the remote work of supervisors.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board is unable to make the necessary decisions, as far as the company's work can be paralyzed.
We agree that such a risk exists, but can he prevent the movement of members of the supervisory board to Ukraine?
Let us imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory board (which make up most of the entire board) put their personal security above the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In such a case, they can be released according to the bill.
And then, sooner or later, it will lead to the loss of the quorum needed by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it is not possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the Supervisory Board, since the law provides for the need for a competition that takes on an average of 3-4 months.
So the decision proposed by Bill 7176 cannot, rather than, prevent the loss of the oversight of the ability to make decisions, but rather, it will lead to it!
National MP, author of Dmitro Nataluh's bill gives other arguments to support him.
In particular, he notes: "Many companies, such as the OPC, now need relocations" and, therefore, "it's hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna to Zoom."
For the first time, in Ukraine there are almost no OPCs that have oversight advice.
The Supervisory Board is wrong in the Ucrobourprom, which is essentially managing almost all of the OPC's operations.
But even in the Ucrobraprom, according to legislation, the Supervisory Council has a fairly limited mandate, and all its members perform non-free bases.
The full power of the Ucrobobromium is the Director-General, who will decide on the need for the relocation of an OPC that is part of the Consensus.
Moreover, such an argument does not stand in the way of criticism, since Bill 7176 does not at all make any changes to the legislation governing the operation of OPCW.
Mr. Dmitro on his Facebook page also cites the arguments that can be taken into the category "emotional."
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of holding companies and holding banks, but let's try to figure out some of them: "relevant foreign experts with the same word "war" are still leaving Ukraine in 2021, but they are left behind by the supervisory councils in Ukrainian state companies with a full salary of several hundred thousand griffins, while Ukraine itself is actually suffering from war."
First of all, this manipulation -- most of those members of the supervisory board never lived in Ukraine, and they only came here on a regular basis.
That's why they say they're leaving Ukraine, gently saying, unfairly.
Secondly, as a result of the coroner's pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian supervisory councils have long been able to conduct online meetings.
This tool has been widely used in the world’s practice, and in absolutely different areas: business, education, medicine, and so forth.
It is also worth noting that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other jobs, and that's exactly how electronic communications help them.
Third, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitro not make identical claims to the members of the supervisory councils who are Ukrainians?
Because they do not have a place to find their own companies.
In short, this is not the first populist attempt to remove foreigners from the supervisory council, and the war is just a new convenient opportunity.
Hi, I'm in Ukraine, I'm looking for possible options for temporary shelter in my family, with me two kids.

We usually need a passport from one of the adults.
In the Brvatska, Vishgorod, and Buchansk districts of the Kyiv region, which were released from the occupations, a stronger commandant hour for 2 years is introduced.
Paul’s direct speech is: “In the inhabited areas of the Brvatska, Visegorod and Buchanan, which were under Russian occupation and were released by the Ukrainian defence forces, the commandant hour has been increased!
These cities and forces will operate from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5th."
Details: According to the head of the bulwark, this time it is strictly prohibited to live on the streets of the settlements and in other public places, to move by transportation and pedestrians.
People can only go out on the street when the alarm is signaled to go into hiding.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the effects of Russian aggression — to clean up and spread the territory.
The omelian called on people who had left the area to stay away from their return home.
In the rest of Kyivčina's territory, the day-to-day command time will last from 21:00 to 6:00 a.m.

Following the full-scale aggression against Ukraine, Western countries took the prospect of possible escalation in the Balkans very seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

Lucashenka’s regiments held three 27 - and 28 - year - old balloons involved in the destruction of two relay shafts of the Osipovica system, which ensures the movement of railways.
Source: Radio Swaboda, Human Rights Centre of the East, Head of the Criminal Police of the IMF, Gennadius Kazakevich, quoted by the Belta intelligence agency.
In the IMF, Belarus reported that on the night of March 30th, three Bobrujska residents were detained, one was injured for their strong support of the SBR specials.
According to news reports, men in detention were actively opposed and tried to escape.
Security forces were using weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical institution.
Others were given medical attention.
The head of the IMF criminal police, Bilorus, Gennadius Kazakevic, said that "acts of terrorism on RB's railway would be severely stopped" by force using weapons.
On April 6th, it became known that on March 30, the police held another collaborator of the Belarusian Railway, a collaborator of the Barranovic Department of the BZD and the administrator of the BZD thematic resources at the VContact and the "Unclassicals" of Valentin Samasuk.
Where he is now living and where he is unknown, @belzhd_live reports.
At the end of March, at the end of the day, at least 40 railways were detained in Belarus.
We remember that the formation of BYpol, declared by the Lucashenk extremist regime, continues to call for the diversion of Belarus's rail transport and infrastructure in the framework of the Peramag plan.
The Belarusian "relical partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
It is known that by means of Bilorus RF, the RF is turning to war in Ukraine, living power and technology.
It's for raising self-assessment.

US prohibit investment in RF and impose sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with G7 and the EU, impose new sanctions on the daughters of President Putin, the largest banks of the RF Alpha Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is a report on the White House website.
Sjerbank is Russia's largest financial institution owned by the government, and Alpha-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets relating to the U.S. financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States has completely banned new investments in the RF.
To this end, President Joe Baiden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investment in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on more than 600 transnational companies' decision to leave Russia.
The output of the private sector includes producers, energy companies, large-scale retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers, such as legal and consultancy companies," says the White House.
The third step in the new sanctions from the United States has been the restriction on large Russian government companies in the critical area.
This will prevent US citizens from operating with these organizations and freeze any assets they have in the jurisdiction of the States.
Minfin's detailed list will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of the children of Putin, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including the President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitri Medvedi and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishstein.
The sanctions decompose them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

I was happy and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we have the hope that at the very first time someone will come to us) we can even pay the room or the apartment, but if it is on our pockets.
We guarantee purity and order.
We don't have harmful habits.
We will be grateful for such help in such a time - consuming way.
After lunch, I had one lesson in English, and after that I went to work in the children’s room.
I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understands everything, and everything will work out fine.
I also met Mrs. Lena and talked to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She made a announcement from the pool.
It's free swimming.
You can call school, Kira doesn't pick up the phone, she doesn't answer, I don't know if she went to school.
They isolate the Russian office: they stop investment and stop supplying.
However, we did not understand.
There was no military in our home.
Our home is near the military and the oil base
He just helped me because I couldn't do it myself.
A taste of cooking, not asking for a meal, and giving good advice
I'm giving my advice.
It's kind of hard for me, but I understand I have to go through this stage.
I'll meet you on Thursday, and I'll tell you everything.
It's all right.
I'm kidding you how often you're cleaning up.
I clean every week.
I'm sorry, I don't have a program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I Dreamed of being a Teacher
My girls can't go anywhere right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you heard about the house information, I'd be able to know.
I'd be happy to rent a house with a decent girl.
If you can know that, let me know.
On my own, I'm not going to let go.
Thank you soon.
You have not been able to write another Natal person for 54 years. Please write the exact address and the price of the courses.
I think you better make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I didn't change my name, it was one of my births:)
I'm sorry I didn't see you, but I'll do it now, and I'll send it to you right away.
We're going to the medical committee now.
I mean, Ani needs to work this hour on another day.
What day is it better to come earlier? (may be a little more work?)
I'm hearing tomorrow, the Internet's working badly.
You're lucky what you're gonna do.
Thank you... we found something from things, but there was nothing from technology...
Both beginers, except orbits we don't know anything.
There's nothing going on.
Is it possible on Monday, 25.04?
Children can be taken with them, the toy here is enough:)
Remember Dad?
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'm thinking about this money.
We'll do it sometime.
But as this will be paid, please, no credit.
Write me right, and I'll help.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
You need to take the clothes they gave you?
It's not my day.
Something came from you, I can't see that.
I’m also very sad
I remind you of the bill later
You only have a father speaking and understanding Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to clean up his house, and how many houses have windows?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't share with you.
I'd like to read Joe Dispens, he's doing scientific research on the impact of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections.
The journalist of the TV channel "1+1" Natalia Nagorna released the 12th April video that she was handed over to the 36th Marine Corps in Mariúpol.
It tells the soldiers that there were no weapons left to take part in the battles and the mountains of the wounded.
They said "the bill goes for an hour."
Previously, on April 11, 36th, a separate seabed brigade that took part in the Mariupola defense, published a Russian address to Ukrainians.
The statement stated that April 11 could be the last fight for the defenders of Mariupoli, and the Ukrainian military command was not connected to the fighters for two weeks.
Skeepsis, published in Russian, was reported on in the so - called social media.
The Chief Commander of the Defence Forces of Ukraine, Valerie Załujny, assured us that the command link with the Defence Forces in Mariúpolis is, and the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of a public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the area of the Azostan plant in Mariupoli and to use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian teammates dropped on Mariúpol the poison of unknown origin.
As told by Aza leader Andrey Billicki, the RF army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which maintains the battles of the Azov team.
Thank you, I'll settle down under you.
The situation is the same as we're staying here.
2 hours driving )) walk, mom in the shops and back!
It's not an important matter.
She forgot what she was going to do here.
The Czech drone squadron from today began flying over Ukraine.
Nearly 50 professional diggers will serve to detect, and some of them will serve to direct the destruction of an enemy predator.
Two Carpathians and two Czech “birds ” in Ukraine were sent to Ukraine in the evening thanks to the MP of the Mucachian Messier Vladimir Labutenka.
Today, because their introductory friends in front of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplere101/ Vasil Thuram delivered drones for destination: they were given special divisions of Ukrainian troops in various cities where fighting is currently taking place.
With the aim of making the best and safe use of the copyists, we will now remain in the secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, say: In the near future, many more interesting “gifts” will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian crew and preserve the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I love sweet, but I can't do it without it.
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'll be back in Ukraine soon, keep working.
Okay, if it's okay, I'll agree.
I'll try myself, but if problems arise, I'll write you down if possible?
A Key to Understanding One Another
We were personally in the old lady in the village of Job, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no one
Maybe she'll be happy, and she'll get her mood up.
I was being repaired today.
And I think I'm still on the street today.
I've had medications and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry, too, but I'd better meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, take off the music you like.
I'm curious about your musical skills.
Mom and Dad should be obedient
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's belt.
It's colder and colder, and it's supposed to be hot tomorrow.
But there's no harm in ruined buildings, there's no harm in people being abused.
In Herson, the bandits were familiar with the memory of Slav Ukraine in Herson on the street of Prescopsky.
Details: It is noted that the unknown broke the flag of the European Union, consumed the panels with photos of the hundreds of Heavens and the dead in the Russian-Ukraine War.
The bandits destroyed the portraits of the Heroes of the Sky and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukraine War.
Take the flag.
Good morning, thank you to the kids for the ride, we don't have a habit like that, so we didn't know, give the kids only chocolate and cooking, maybe there was something else to give.
The Czechs have someone to talk to, if they do.
Because I live a guy in a gang where twelve people are going to be here, and then they're going to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
I've been in trouble today.
Even today, he's been sleeping there.
That is why we are making great progress.
I'm going to have to bring the wands together!
I don't have the strength to do it today.
Since I'm away from the days and the time when there's a cleaning job after the guests, I can say about a month on April because I already have an approximate cleaning schedule.
On May - I can say about the end of April or at the beginning of May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hi, I'm sorry she hasn't been writing dinner in a while, and she's a little sleepy.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
or we'll meet you after your arrival)
He's a modest man, and he's been learning a lot lately, and he's got a lot of learning to understand that he really needs it in his life.
Hello, everything went very well.
I was kind of shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Today, there is a small lesson from a lady who is the head of the Economics Department of the Land of Highness.
She was very pleased with my work.
The sin in the scars was a good thing to do.
On Monday, I have to make a confirmation of employment as well as a cash payment.
I'm going to leave on Friday.
I don't do anything just to them and sleep. (and drink a lot of water.)
If she's going to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you if I can.
I'm going to import another analysis.
I don't have to go again.
It's very bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's got to be done.
That's what it's all about.
Can you send me the right e-mail address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language you're writing to.
And are the children to be brought there?
And now for a minute you can go in there is one question.
If you still need help, write down
If I'm not wrong, you're celebrating the Passover today, right?
At first, we didn't really want you to make money, so people wouldn't think we were speculating on it!
But for online filling, I didn't have two points:
I'm going to be able to relax. I'm going to get some power and energy.
I'm going to watch the video right now, that's good, because the whole family is going to draw.
The University of Karasin calls on employees and students to check carefully any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, hearings and tiles.
Focus only on official information.
That's how you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who stays in Ukraine also helps the army
I've got some work for portfolios.
After the festival, they have to go online.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How I Count the Day That I Was Not at Work Is a Passion
Stock Exchange: Russia prepares a provocation in Pristina to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army can succeed in provocations in the Prinistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "in aggression against the neighboring state."
In effect, "The military forces of the Russian Federation are not excluded from provocative actions in the territory of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state."
Details: The opponent continues to create the next group of armies for action in the Divine Direction.
In the near future, the crew will likely try to reinvigorate the attack.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and dispatch a special composition, weapons, and techniques for participation in fighting operations in the territory of Ukraine.
Arms and military equipment are being developed at the 60th permanent deployment of the Special Motorbike Brigade (Monastericht) of the 5th Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that the marked weapon will be moved to a temporary occupied territory of the Donutian region.
Also, to restore the loss of the special composition of the battalion tactical group's divisions of the 36th individual motorcycle brigade (Borza, Zabykali County) of the 29th Army of the Eastern Military District, a set of military personnel from the designated brigade is carried out.
The particular problem of the enemy is that the driver's position and the driver's mechanics are compiled.
The presence of a special component from the permanent dislocation point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It's possible that the opponent, in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the battlefield, will continue to hit the transport infrastructure sites in Ukraine with the aim of destroying them or getting them out of the way.
Definitive divisions of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out the task of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Bilor border in the Brist and Gomel regions.
In the Slovak direction, separate divisions of the 6th General Army and the coastal forces of the North Fleet continue to block the city of Harkow, during the artillery shootings of individual areas of the city.
In the Islamic direction, an airfield is conducted to detect the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
For this, the opponent uses the Orlan-10 BPL.
With the strength of two battalion tactical groups, the enemy attempted to make an effort to move towards the Dmitrac and the Duggenque settlements, without success, and to go to a previously occupied position.
In the Donetic direction, the enemy continues to focus on the taking of control of the villages of the Red Sea, the Lower and Novobakhmutka, as well as the complete control of the city of Mariúpol.
The enemy tried to make a storm of action in the Golden Age area, and he did not succeed.
In the city of Mariúpol, the crews continue to operate in the areas of Azovstal and the seaport.
The forces of the individual divisions of the enemy carried out the artillery shots of the Ukrainian army in the areas of the settlements of the High Pillar, Trudolovek and Marjansk.
In the territory of Donetsk and Lugansk, Ukraine's defenders of the past era have been attacked by four enemy attacks, destroyed by five tanks, eight armed units, six cars, and eight artillery systems.
Didn't she understand your thoughts?
Of course we're trying to make it, but I doubt it.
And how do you want to sleep and I'll delay you?
Are you sure you don't mind if I come?
Maybe you just don't want to see today, so tell me, I'll get it.
Thank you, we didn't watch TV at home, so we don't have to set up 1 + 1 :)
I'm going to turn on the TV just to listen to the Czech language.
I'm finishing my monthly tariff package today :)
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy fabric to hang, canvas, thread to hang
I understand, then I can prepare material in this area.
I'm gonna ask her, I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she's giving us a lot of pies.
We'll meet my father later, of course.
I read a statement in the Facebook, which, I think, Google wrote something like that, I think the phone number is enough.
Good day, we're the things you brought, but there are things that little ones can bring to us in 10 minutes?
I thought about the reason for the job.
If the director is in charge, I can start working from next week because tomorrow morning I plan to go to the office to report the documents (if you get them, because they're very busy) and on Saturday rain:)
I'm looking for a brigade at the beginning, I like chemistry at school, I'm studying Czech to know perfectly, I'm dreaming to work on you.
Friends of old and not very, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends of the spirit and mind.
Now you've had a hard time, too.
During the last month, I have been communicating with many of you.
Your life, which was never easy without it, turned from one foot to another, as was the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you run away from Russia.
And many of you have admitted that they feel guilty and ashamed because of your country’s actions toward your neighbors.
Because they're giving Ukraine your name.
Some of you, activists, have been writing a long time ago, and you are preparing for a decisive blow.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from the Memorial.
Let us tell you a little later — as usual — Sasha responded in a laconical way. — We are going through the ruins right after the visit.
Others — artists, critics, writers — are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be open: except for the very few of you -- those who worked in the Memorial, in the Newspaper, in the Echo Moscow, in the Medusa, in the organization of the Naval and in other places -- would many of you have done anything to counter this regime?
Unless they were at the meeting when they were still there.
Also read the column of the Russian journalist, "Slow to hide, keep silent."
And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your lasting indifference to what is happening around you, your appetite and your passive participation, which are now likely to be a great burden to your soul and heart?
That was not always the case.
In 1990, there was a brief period when you had to a certain extent enjoyed freedom and democracy, even a wrong, but a real one.
But 1991 proved to be no better than 1917.
Why does every time a revolution finally takes place, you're finally so terrified of the sadness that you're looking for salvation behind the king's back, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he didn't kill, you still think he was safer.
There were indeed errors.
Instead of catching and publishing the CDB archives, as did the Germans from the stand, you took the soul to the Djerzinsk Memorial, and allowed the CDB to lie down, to upgrade, to reform and to seize power over the country.
When you were put before the choice between the country's robbery and the return of the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of the third option, and you were humbly reconciled to the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, and that meant the end of mass rallys for great social justice or the war in Chechnya.
Life has become a major concern.
And then Putin showed up, a young, business-friendly, aggressive, he promised to deal with the terrorists and raise the economy.
A few of you have bought it, but you have voted for it, or you have preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to compare the Czech with the earth again, most of you were attracted to it.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya, helping the victims of the travel "anti-terrorist operation", and seeing with my eyes the ruins of the Great, Qatar-Yurti, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on the exits I returned to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of peaceful people, the killing of children, the soldiers who sold bodies to their families.
You said to me, "Well, we've got your Chechnya. " I remember those words very well.
The answer was, "Friends, it's not my Chechen, it's your Chechen.
It's your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It's your government that bombes one of your cities, kills your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then there was an economic rise in the middle of zeros, agreed by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers to see that some of the money stolen would remain in the middle class pockets.
Many of you have gained a good job, some rich, and even the poorest of you have acquired a new home and found a better job.
The prices have grown, and isn't that bad?
Moscow shined out of the dog's throat.
When several of you were killed by opposers, such as Yuria Sjukochihin, Anna Politkovsky, Alexander Litvinenka, and others, many of you were shocked and expressed fears about what was happening.
Still, the matter was not settled.
When Putin transferred President Medvedi's post after two terms, and he took the Prime Minister's seat, you, as I can see, barely paid attention to it.
When after a few months of Soviet rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or kept silent.
How many of you have I met in the years to come on the mountain slopes of Goodauri, in the suburbs of Kazbegi or in the cafes and in the Turkish lairs of Tbilisi while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we hardly did much in the West if we did anything at all.
A bit of resentment, a little bit of sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia’s cripplingly violating international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and the internal market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, it was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, woke up.
When Putin re-changed the seats with Medvedi and the president's chair, as before, many of you decided it was too much, and you went out on a massive protest.
The name of Naval has become famous, you haven't left the street for five years, and the regime has finally felt terrible that it's losing ground under its feet.
Then he struck him in the face.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some have been given huge terms.
"And what could we do?"
I've heard it so often, and I still hear it.
"The country is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look what they did two years ago.
Angry by the proselyte president, who fooled their European expectations, they once seized Mayan — and never left him.
They built their own tent town and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy him, they began to defend themselves by using Molotov’s thumbs, arms, and cocktails.
The police finally opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protestors turned into attackers.
Many have died, but they have won.
The fugitive became Janukovic, and the Ukrainians returned to democracy, the right to choose leaders themselves and expel them if they did not do their job properly.
Maydan didn't like Putin very much.
This was a bad example.
So, using the general condolences, he caught Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there was little benefit.
How many of you have been caught!
As far as I know, 91 percent of the Russians supported the annexation.
From where a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his jokes came back at 180 degrees and began to worship him.
I find it hard to find a reason because we stopped dating right after that.
The rest of my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you've just been hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks, just like the new ones after the restoration of Moscow in 2012, with their binbegams, the public toilet and the hipster coffee.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and it's only getting better.
You've almost paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
Even the Moscow editor who released my book on Syria then criticized her in an interview because I hardly understood what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least, I drove there and I saw myself on the streets of Homs' state snipers shooting coldly at my children's peers.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers, who started to bomb thousands of peacekeepers in 2015, gained experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Nimeller:
"At first they came after the socialists, but I spoke, because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came after the trade union members, but I spoke because I was not a trade union member.
Then they came to the Jews, but I kept silent because I was not a Jew.
Then they came after me, but there was no one left who could say anything about my protection."
How many of you have been talking about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did it.
But the vast majority kept silent.
Some actually speak now — such as Dmitro Gluhovski, Mikhailo Shiskin, Mikhailo Zigar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Oujennikov, risking getting into a new GULAG or setting up a Nawal company.
As far as others are concerned, you are best aware of the country in which you live.
So I'm sure you understand, when Putin gets married to the Ukrainians -- or what seems to be very likely if he doesn't, he'll take you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who are brave but mostly alone have gone out on protests and still have a little time, but soon they will get more serious.
For thousands of you who have signed the petition, who have made a difference in their lives (even a black square in Instagram) or have spoken in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of free will were given just for anecdote, they're not in that far past -- and now they're very likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who's going to speak for you, who's going to leave?
The example of Ukrainians – even more than 2014, – fears the travel regime: they prove that they can fight it.
And that mind, motivation, and courage can stop him, which would not be the overwhelming advantage of his paper.
Considering all of this, few people in Russia realize this, as well as what is going on in the war.
But you, my friends, know what's going on right now.
You're reading the news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine that you support.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know what it's all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence ended.
Your election is just a hog, your laws, if you don't take account of the repressive ones, they don't cost more than the paper on which they wrote, your last free media is gone, your economy is destroyed faster than I write, you don't have credit cards anymore to buy tickets on a plane abroad, even if some travels are still there.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will require your agreement, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try or go, or you'll get disappointed.
I doubt you'll see another version.
And yet another one remains.
What's the last thing that's going to break this?
And you may need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not come from you: because of the economic collapse that takes place in Russia, it will most likely burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices run low and wages are not paid, those who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace would go out in the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people a lot more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes out to meet itself, as it has been, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them individually.
Organization and coordination will be required. The crowd will need to be converted to a mass.
You have this great magic tool -- the Internet that the regime can limit, but which is still working and which can be adjusted in almost any circumstances.
The Revival organization has been fragmented, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized.
You're a lot, you're millions.
The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If there's more than 300 thousand, it's going to be overwhelmed.
We have to use the army, but will this army fight Putin when it comes to business?
After all that he forced them to do in Ukraine, what made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will feel a sense of dread; those who have children will be afraid of them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid of you, too.
As for Syria, and now for Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who are forced to neglect their master, who are forced not only to demand freedom but really try to get it.
But even if you don't do anything, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will end the joke in a computer game -- and he will be arrested; your daughter will express resentment on the Internet -- and be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes -- and he will die in the Syrian camera under the police den.
This is what has been happening for many years — and it will only continue to increase by increasing and increasing.
So you don't have a choice, if you don't do anything, you know what's going to end.
Be cool, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were at work on Friday, and we were told that we could come by Monday.
We'll be home at night.
That you're treating me as a press secretary.
How often are you going to dinner in a expensive restaurant?
Once on the market, I'm going to dinner at a expensive restaurant.
I'll try to explain everything to her.
So we liked it very nice and we wanted something brighter, so this is the best option.
I was in a room where there were many people.
I feel bad, cough, temperature, voice missing, weakness and head turning
I have to go to that government work.
We've already done this, but we've said who's registered in the April prize money only at the end of the month.
We need a break on Thursday, we're going to the doctor with the kids.
But at night I wrote a lady who liked your work, and she would like something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her and I'm going to have to report.
Working at the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, mental work that I was completely disappointed in.
It's a waste of time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I’m communicable, but I’m serious about being single and getting married.
There was a man for whom I had to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I believe that in order to create a family, people must love, respect, trust each other.
Right now, I didn't see it like that.
Good morning. Where can you get the shape of a paddle (paper or silicone) in Jeep?
All right, thanks for the advice, then I'll put a witness to Wall in the poll.
She's in a state of bed, she's now in a leg fractured in a hip, she's in a wheelchair, she's all over in a blender.
Mr. Reihard, I'm sorry to bother you at a time of inactivity.
But I have important questions for you.
I went to the playroom in Natalie today to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the baby because she said that she had come to see things and to arrange them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valerie opened our baby room by 19:00 yesterday.
Can that really be?
It's working time to stay by 4:00.
And finally, it's our responsibility.
But I don't have a load to open a page that's very weak
Good day, we all have a good day) The bike works, yesterday the invitations were filled, and I was with the elders before the exam in high school.
The hardest thing to do is to find out what's going on in geometry.
On Saturday, Volodymir helped us.
Vika studies universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We are very grateful for the house
Yeah, but I thought you weren't full.
We're trying to get the maximum sum to the end of the week to figure out
