Black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying hard to find the money for repairs that break down the road network, many start to see solutions in a small black box that can easily enter the device board of your car.
The devices that monitor every kilometer that the motorist employs, which transmits this information to the authorities, are the core of Washington's controversial efforts and state planning authorities to renovate the old American main roads financing system.
Often, the fake design of the roads has suddenly led to intensive debate and the creation of the different communities.
The libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and praised the government for using these small boxes, which would record the miles and maybe where you are going – and then use this information to collect the tax.
Thea party's scared.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of issues with privacy protection.
And while Congress can't agree whether to continue, some states are not waiting for anything.
They find out how they can move to a system in which the driver pays for a kilometer of the road he is going to drive over the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, to test.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"It is a matter of when we can choose to do so," said Hasan Ikhrat, Executive Director of the Association of State Administration in Southern California, who plans to start monitoring of the kilometres captured by each California motorist in 2025.
It changes the way we pay these taxes.
That's what this technology is for.
The emphasis is that the Road Trust Fund, financed by the taxes paid by the Americans at the pump stations, is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gas as before.
The cars will drive a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased over the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of petrol, politicians are able to raise taxes only by one cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device to 500 cars to test this payment system for a mile away.
"For a long time, it appears as the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of kilometres taken.
It is no surprise that this idea is like urban liberals, because taxes can be used to change drivers' behaviour patterns, which can, for example, help reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas generation.
California designers are looking at this system when planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in the ambitious global warming laws.
But the Republican Bill Shuster (the representative of Pennsylvania), president of the Committee on Transport, said that he also sees it as the most efficient long-term alternative.
The representatives of the Reason Foundation’s free market are also inclined to think that drivers will be paid for miles.
"It is not a tax that disappears in the black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Reason Strategy.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in 2011 the Congress called for a pay-per-kilometre approach.
The US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, which included about 10,000 cars.
However, the management of the survey of representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the residents, whose daily life often means hurting many kilometres of work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The hottest is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying taxes for miles, instead of gas taxes.
The pilot project is not over yet.
New York's just checking out the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent in freight cars.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state transport ministries, together with the coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
This concept, however, does not have a mere stop.
In Nevada, where some 50 cars have recently been equipped with equipment, there was concern that the government is able to monitor every movement.
"The concerns of monitoring the type of Big Brother and similar issues were a major problem," said Alaudin Khan, who manages the strategy and operations at the NW Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the pilot project continued, the American Union of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its websites: "It would be very easy to turn these devices into a full-scale monitoring facility."
There is no need to build an enormously complex technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand on the record of daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
The disaster is among the several states that are trying to find the available technology that would allow the state to monitor how many kilometers the car will be hired, but not exactly when and where.
If you can, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
In such a technology, Hon led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was originally not involved in the government's action in taxing drivers.
She wanted to go through the emerging market to ensure legal responsibility where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they eat.
But this device, which is testing, attracts the attention of road designers because it does not use GPS and only supplies a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
"People will be more willing to go unless you follow their speed and position," says Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programs, a number of major errors occurred.
There are much cheaper and less expensive ways to do it.
In Oregon, projectors are experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with GPS or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any equipment and instead they will decide to pay a flat-rate fee based on the average number of kilometres taken by all the inhabitants of the State.
In other places, they hope that a careful public will adapt to this concept if the device is able to do more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay charges at parking hours, provide insurance per km and collect data on the speed of other drivers, so drivers can avoid traffic congestion.
"The motorists will be willing to take part in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them," the city's project document states.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all the discussion of payments per kilometer is not just a major problem.
Officials of the Metropolitan Committee for Transport in the San Francisco Bay area say that Congress could solve the problem with the bankruptcy of the Road Trust Fund much easier to raise gas tax.
A simple or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid or other vehicles that do not need much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery when you have enough to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Law and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
ČSSD is negotiating Saturday.
Social democracy with fools, people and grandmothers talk and learn a common procedure.
If the social democrats are able to do so within a few weeks, they will be seated at the negotiating table with perfectly qualified partners who will put a list of requirements on the table, including ministerial posts.
The dispatch of ČSSD will then be a massive acidic coalition threat, or a mine on a garden minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka was first attacked after four days when he was on a wave of sympathies.
Yesterday he was unable to control political crime and, above all, to bring the convicted liars to resign.
The approved negotiator is still only him, the other members of the team will be allowed until after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CMP).
I apologized to members of the jury and now to the citizens.
He's not lying, in his personal life, or in the public.
"It was a mistake," said Michael Hasek after the discussion of the lower leadership of social democracy.
He added he won't be the first vice president.
"I will announce my decision on 10 November to the UAV," Hasek said.
Similarly, ČSSD Vice-President Zdeněk Škromach and head of Euronam Tejc MEP.
However, he warned that he was elected just two days ago.
Both Members then announced that they would do everything to make the 50-year-old ČSSD sound one vote.
The absurd theater planted the crown of Michal Hasek with the words: "I am a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to her brand and have respected the decision of the party authorities."
It's another lie in direct transmission.
Or did he forget, in response to the Sobotka's resignation and its withdrawal from the negotiating team, that the August UVV had 57 percent of the vote that Bohuslav Sobotka was a candidate for the prime minister?
The head of the ČSSD, however, made a powerful enemy army by sending UVV to the next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to navigate the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media of the many different holes and fam, possibly recalling the real mistakes of Sobotkov's political career.
There will be a lot of dirty laundry, there will be signs of dark alliances between Zdeňk Bakal and Sobotk's wing.
He will discuss the friendly relationship of Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer of the Council of the Humble.
There are disputes in the ČSSD of the Yugoslavian or Moravian-Scove organisation.
The words of the island's prime minister and Sobotkova's associate Peter Kajnar: "I signed Charter 77 so that the countries do not rule the idiots."
If the U.S.A. met this weekend, the liars would probably be brought to the ritual sacrifice of their functions.
The traitors will shave their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning head of the ČSSD will then end with the name Bohuslav Pirrha.
Martin Doctor about problems with OH in Soči: Communication with Russia is challenging
The eyes of his mouth indicate an improper smile, and then he'll just breathe out, "It's disgusting."
Working with the organizational team of the Olympics in Soči 2014 is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," claims the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slow and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, from the point of view of providing information on key matters no longer so much.
Maybe we've spent three months adding to how the individual villages will be officially designated so that we can do a whole range of things.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating.
In a number of things, they still communicate.
Is there at least a delivery of the Olympic village?
But it's no longer a disaster.
A month ago, we went to the empty rooms.
The houses are lucky.
What does it mean they're empty?
Do you need a ready floor?
Just basic concrete, so that's how it was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even though there's a danger that when we get there on the 26th of January as a front, it'll still feel sticky.
And if they didn't fight, then what?
President Putin would you think he'd be after the army?
That's the way it's gonna happen.
Just so it won't be that Olympic village = the village's homeland.
They're more of a threat to not reaching, for example, the road change, they're not giving details.
Maybe they'll have a way in such a position that we'll have to take the hooligans from London games with us.
But I believe they're kind of giving it to the store.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, that number changes.
Maybe the Krasovers will go in the three of them.
There's no one to doubt about Martin Sáblík's fast-roller, but otherwise it's in progress.
Still waiting for you on your way to Sochi?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
How the houses in the Olympic village will look, we know.
We even measured a few things ourselves so that we wouldn't believe just the charts.
We're also preparing a whole series of other things, including transportation.
And what does the Head of Mission do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus making a regular agenda in the sense of communication with the organizational committee in Soči.
Putin promised the ecological Olympics, his plan was to keep the giant secret.
Winter sports fans are already cutting the meter to start Olympics in Soči, while others are increasingly concerned about their preparation.
The Russian Olympics, as it starts in February, are facing another scandal.
According to all, the Russians are not able to fulfill their promise that the preparation and performance of the game will not, in the least, damage nature in Krasnodar County, at the height of the Kavkaz, where in four months thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors live.
Most recently, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a very high-ranking summer, Canadian games recorded in the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
It seems, however, that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize the games with "zero waste" has taken place long ago.
The rapporteurs of the AP's agencies discovered a huge building material building in the village of Acštyr near Soči last week.
So they found a bottle full of building materials, pneumatics, canisters and insulation foams already found in August, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities were having tea and the bottle was gone.
Just for a moment.
Last week, the reporters were given a look at the three football matches.
She's not the only one, in the area of such places, created a few, described the British newspaper The Times.
The site is a Russian railway station, a state monopoly, which builds about 60 kilometer between Soči airport and a sports resort.
The company, which already had 280 billion rubles, led one of the nearby Putin co-workers Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railways were prevented from establishing a warehouse by any of the subcontractors.
Locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achthyr, all around three months of the day and night they are driving trucks full of waste material.
According to experts, waste is contaminated by the local river Mzymtu, by other rivers and finally by the Black Sea.
"The water from here pollutes soybean waters for the next ten to fifteen years," said Vladimir Kimaev of the EWNC environmental non-profit organization.
The illegalities are not the only problem of the Russian Organizational Committee and Government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, they're, according to the opposition, one big tunnel.
For comparison: The Soči games will cost 51 billion dollars, while the summer Olympics in Beijing in 2008 went up to 43 billion.
Last year's games in London stood only 19 billion and the so-called Vancouver Nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns, if the snow is to be enough, reports have also appeared that human rights are not respected when working on sports facilities and infrastructures.
Last month, one of the workers put his mouth on a protest that he had not received two months' salary.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers act in the course of the game with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are going to support the Russian gays at the Olympics.
The young couple grew up living with their parents, the new house offers private to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates has been given the task of designing a house on the plot, which lies on the corner of two streets, with the land itself somewhat cooled.
The requirement went on to say that two generations would live in the house, who would want to live together, but then everyone should have their own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house is on the corner of two streets and on a slightly frozen ground.
Architects therefore decided to place each household into one of the fathers of the house.
"When we made the proposal, we respected family ties, history and memories associated with the place."
"The three different functions of the house are connected several roads through the exterior of the object, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but then they have their own privacy," the designers explain.
The parents ’ home is at the garden level with an old boron, to which family traditions and memories are weighed.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable outside, so different end-of-life façades are different.
While the main segment of the building is of concrete, the surface of which has been constructed using panels from the wall, the part where the office is, is denied white and the remaining elements remained in clean concrete implementation without any further modification.
Many of the walls of the house are completely exposed, which makes the interior very connected to the exterior.
The home of parents, more precise kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The connection of the interior with the exterior is submerged by the side wall, which starts on the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enter the house with the main entrance to the hall, and then they walk up the stairs into their spaces.
It's just that the damage is the main dominant of the interior of the house.
Their construction enables them to destroy a lot of natural light through their cascade.
This is exactly what the architects were trying to distinguish the house from the others and print it something unique.
The home of a young couple is arranged as an open room with kitchenette, dining room and living together.
From the terrace, it's only a glass wall with a sliding door.
The living area with a dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space that passes freely on the terrace, from which is a nice view of the Tokyo Gulf.
A single office at the highest level is characterized by a clean combination of white and black.
The shed is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple go into the main entrance, they go into the entrance hall, and then they walk up the stairs.
Defend academic freedoms, it pays for Zeman and ODS.
Over the past few months, I have repeatedly called for open letters from students, educators and seniors in a number of countries to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign conducted by President Milos Zeman at schools.
I've met with more or less success.
The Rector of Masarykov University in Brno, who rejected the presentation of the honour of President SPOZ - Zemanovci during the pre-election period, has even received an invitation in the form of an invitation to the State celebration of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of school representatives who were no longer so static and made it possible to visit Milos Zeman: High Technical Training in Brno, Gymnázium Coldov in Ostrava, High Business School in Ostrava, Business Academy in Cologne, University of J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
Now in Pardubice, we are meeting to continue to promote politics in high schools.
The newly elected MP for the ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computers of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic function and also seems normal to him.
Professor, it's really not like you're left in the function of the mayor of a smaller city.
Do you want to join the ČSSD hetmans who are performing the functions of MPs and hetmans at the same time and who are degrading both calls?
So you're telling people they're going to be able to handle both these demanding functions on the left.
I know, we have the example of Michal Haška, who manages even several dozens of functions at once.
But it's probably not just an example of the person you're supposed to be driving.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Szpánky Franko, who prefers to leave the post so that she can fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the function of the dean is that in the context of the functions, you violate the apolicity of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubic ODS sees your current action on both positions as an advantage to the University.
"Your" school, however, will be able to help you without staying a thank-you.
I think the same opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig will have your students.
So consider your retreat and keep your face on.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the voters are counting on you in future elections.
And it doesn't have to take a long time.
In the Kunović bubble greens, the chemicals don't add to it
More than a thousand tons of oxidized herbs want to be produced in the coming months in the Slovak Fruit of Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season here began in October and will last for about half a year.
A healthy appetite has been produced here since 1925 in a traditional way, i.e. by smoking directly in large dances.
In modern industrial times, it's about rarity.
Our labs are heading for a change of nearly ten kilometer route.
In each of the ten tanks, there are fifteen to thirty tons of green, filling one takes three shifts," said the head of the Slovak Frut David Kladrob race.
Green cells drive to the company area directly from their fields of farmers mostly from Ostrožska and Břeclavska.
The workers of Fruity then clean up the vegetables, remove the baskets and throw them into the laps.
From there the already carved green falls into swimming pools of six-foot depth, where they work tirelessly in white clothes and hooligans.
That's what makes the air uncomfortable.
The last wet layer of green is covered with moisture and is covered with water.
"The green round then matures six to eight weeks for spontaneous milking without any supplement to the supportive chewing substances," said director Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to production under domestic conditions, the individual levels of workers proliferate in salt and soil.
He's on his way to the filling line after he's exhausted.
It is packed in a sugarcane into bags or bottles and is served with sterilisation.
Hamé is supplying oxidized herbs, especially on the domestic and Slovenian markets.
The interest is also registered in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "co-operate" with Germany in connection with US monitoring
Edward Snowden, a U.S. reporter, announced that he would be willing to go to Berlin to give the German Parliament evidence if the US National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander would not be able to answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Strèbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him the possibility of testifying in Germany.
In a letter from Mr Snowden, who sent the MP to the media on Friday in Berlin, it is stated: "Although the result of my efforts was manifestly positive, the government continues to act as a fugitive and is trying to criminalize political demonstrations to difficult complaints that do not give room for defence."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the Government of the United States to recover the charge of criminal acts against it.
The charges imposed by the Ministry of Justice of the United States include espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said about Time Online magazine: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible."
The tension between the U.S. and Germany began to rise when it became apparent that the NSA was listening to the phone from the office of Angely Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of Parliament who is leading a parliamentary panel that is monitoring the reporting, said that if it was any opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the United States", it should be done.
Mr Strebele, a parliamentarian on the German side of the Greens, published a photo on his Twitter contribution with Mr Snowden.
On their way to Russia, two German journalists accompanied her.
Mr. Strebele said that according to former contractual lawyer NSA, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need to ensure that he would be "safe" there, a member of parliament said.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said he was facing a harsh and persistent campaign associated with the persecution that forced him to leave home.
He said, however, that the world's reaction to his "political statement" added courage to him.
The citizens of the whole and the senior officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the discovery of an unresolved system of universal monitoring for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
Killing us is sorry, but we're innocent, the representatives of the Red Khmer fight.
Nuon Chea was the number two in the hierarchy of the Red Khmer and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
In 1975 to 1979, the Government of the Red Khmer, which was based on a mix of mosaics and nationalism, came to life as a result of extermination, hunger, disease, torture and repair of more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the population then.
Tomuto's unrecognised prison commander S-21 awarded the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia a life sentence in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, bribery and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were shocked by the belief that they acted in the best interest of the people and did not know what the real extent of killing is.
"It's easy to say that I should know everything, understand everything, and then try and correct the situation," Khieu Samphan said Thursday before the court.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea pointed out that he never ordered the Red Khmer flags to "behave with people badly or kill them to defend their food or feed them with genocide".
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to apologize sincerely to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all Cambodian people," he said.
Fifteen-year-old Bin Sivla, who became eleven relatives under the Red Khmer regime, told the AFP that she could not accept Nuon Chea's apology."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be released."
"He's not worried about the other," she said.
"If he hadn't issued orders, his orders would not have killed," she added, "the leaders of the Red Khmer are worse than the monster."
Before the trial, he also had to become the "minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Red Khmer Ieng Sarah regime, who died this March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, found in September 2012 an incapacitated process for dementia.
Rudh Khmer leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to pay the manual charges
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to USD 100 in its years for the deposit of the handbag on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to 100 USD for the handbag and 2 USD for coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday they said that travellers will be able to leave the entire cane.
The new fee for the manual luggage relates to the luggage in the upper spare space, so the small luggage under the seat will continue to be free of charge.
Frontier says it will charge 25 USD if the fee is paid in advance, and 100 USD if the passengers with the payment wait until they come to the gate.
Frontier Kate O'Malley's spokesperson stated that a hundred-dollar fee should encourage the traveller to take care of the payment in advance.
"We hate choosing this fee," she said.
The airlines started to pay for the first and second commitments in 2008.
Travelers tried to avoid these fees and stuck in the handbags hidden in the spare space as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in this space.
Fees are one way of teaching passengers to take less things on board.
O'Malley said that in the sense of this new fee, it's not really getting more money.
It is said that Frontier's most loyal customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the upper spare space is still more difficult.
Travelers who buy their tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger on the front at Frontier's gate can bring a pledge that he will not pay for, while the other passenger on the front will pay $100 for the same pledge.
O'Malley said that websites and recovery procedures would be adjusted to ensure that passengers would be informed of the fee before their arrival to the gate.
The new Frontier fee for the manual fee will not yet be in force before the summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Travelers often complain about fees for luggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the manipulations are committed to money, and passengers who demand this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street receive another fee for the engagement as a sign that airlines are trying to select enough money to cover the costs of air operations after years of loss.
Most, however, failed to meet the fees for the handbags.
Spirit Airlines, as the first to pay for the manual loan three years ago, followed its example later.
The only company that also has such fees is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely monitoring additional charges.
In its December 2011 report, it estimated that the payment for the manual fee of Spirit would bring USD 50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines employee, recently flew to Spirit and wondered what he saw at the door when the passengers met with an unusual payment of Spirit for the manual bag.
"The approach to the plane was the fastest I've ever seen in my flight career," he said.
I was waiting to see a toothbrush and a fight at the door.
The plane was full, he said, "and the approach was in the neck."
Frontier also uses the Spirit to pay for coffee, tea, soda and juice.
Frontier has stated that travellers who get lemonade or juice can leave the whole canister and the coffee will be added for free.
The water will continue to be provided free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways tried to introduce a fee for drinks, but after seven months of complaints, it stopped and no other prominent airline did.
The last move of Frontier to pay off the manual deposit if the passengers do not buy flights directly from this airline, its last effort is to direct customers directly to its website.
Air carriers pay online travel sellers, such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each air ticket sold.
This enabled all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of doing so through Internet travel agencies.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, she began giving customers who bought via the Internet travel agency only half a mile within the framework of the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the salary for the flown mile for 25 percent of the mile from the road.
So the journey with Frontier is 1000 miles long purchased via the internet travel agency means the reward of 250 miles.
Customers also allow the company to choose its seat in advance only if they purchase directly through Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a reliable customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is beginning to suffer and lose money.
According to the financial results reported in the middle of the company partner Republic Airways Holdings, the markets fell by 9 per cent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter.
The Republic is trying to deal with the financial problems of Frontier with the sale of this airline.
The fall of NSA websites does not blame hackers, but "internal error"
The Secret National Security Agency stated last Friday that its websites for several hours last week fell due to internal failure, not due to the attack of hackers, as some have claimed on the Internet.
“NSA.gov’s pages were not available today for several hours due to an internal error that occurred during regular updates,” the Spanish agency stated in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be removed during the evening.
The claim that the accident was caused by the DDoS attack (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Earlier this evening, online servers recorded that NSA websites did not work for at least six hours, and sites are still unavailable for some users.
Previously, the NSA spokesperson at ABC News said that the Agency's internal sensitive networks were not "at all" threatened.
The speaker said no hidden information was at stake.
At least one group of online hackers claimed to be responsible for resolving NSA sites through the DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until servers cross and the site falls.
This cybernetic tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super-tony agency, which once received a nickname No such agency, has been able to detect foreign and domestic monitoring programmes in the middle of the public attention and criticism, in general, to remove NSA secret files from the agency and to express their views to former former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted earlier speculation that the accident today was the result of a targeted cybernetic operation.
The profit of Bombardier fell as a result of the decrease in supplies and orders
Canadian aircraft and trains manufacturer Bombardier declared on Thursday a 15 % decrease in net profit due to smaller numbers of orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and to the contractual problems of the train unit.
The company Bombardier also did not publish any data on the flight test for its new CSeries aircraft in Montreal, nor did it offer any relevant information as to whether this aircraft would comply with the ambitious plan to start its commercial operation from the next September.
After the initial test flight, about a month and a half of the plane only flew three times and a question arose as to whether the test phase was doing well.
The results did not meet the estimates and the stock exchange in Toronto declined by 8 per cent.
The State Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen reduced the rating on Thursday from "high performance" to "sector performance" with the expectation that the stock exchange will experience limited growth during the next quarter or two.
"In view of the smaller deliveries of the aircraft we expected most, we were greatly disappointed by the profit margin in the area of transport," Doerksen told customers in the report.
As the pilot program continues, we believe that Bombardier will receive new CSeries aircraft orders.
However, if no new orders will be notified in the coming months, we assume that the market will increase in growth towards this programme.
The company Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft are fighting into the sub-area of the market that now dominates Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was discovered in March and after a few months of delay the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of mandatory orders of CSeries is limited to 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the pilot flight to verify the company’s claims concerning low consumption and savings at the costs of this aircraft.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected that when the first aircraft was introduced into commercial use, Bombardier would achieve its 300 mandatory orders.
The leaders also assured the analysts and the media that the programme is in line with the plan on Thursday.
"The pilot did not remain on the ground longer than expected," said Beaudoin in a conference call and noted that the country's tests and software updates were planned during the departure of the aircraft.
Every producer is planning them differently.
We decided to graduate the first year and then focus on updating, and we did.
That's gonna happen during the entire flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of five pilots should fly in the coming weeks and the other not long thereafter.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier argues that it has assessed its plan to introduce the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the following months.
“This slow pace of summer tests – although in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – is likely to strengthen our view that the launch will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
Of the 172 million USD or 9 cents for one share in the previous year, the net profit of Bombardier for 147 million USD or 8 cents for one share was lost in the third quarter at the end of September 30.
The adjusted yield per share remained unchanged for 9 cents.
The turnover has decreased marginally from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
According to the IBES, Thomson Reuters analysts expected the return of 10 cents to one share and turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest manufacturer of aeroplanes stated that, in contrast to 57 aircraft a year ago, only 45 aircraft were added during that quarter.
Clear orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Non-compliances in the air division amounted to 32.9 billion by 30 September, which does not change until 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our perspectives, but the low revenue of orders and the overall market situation disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
The revenue in the aviation industry fell by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said that income in this division increased by almost 11 per cent to US$ 2.1 billion.
Infringements in transport amounted to 32.6 billion by 30 September, which is the opposite of marginal growth on 31 December.
The distribution of profits in the transport division has been affected by problems with the implementation of several major contracts.
The leaders stated that new prospects would be provided in the fourth quarter.
The company Bombardier, which also announced the income of the financial director of Google Patrick Pichette, decreased during the business on Thursday afternoon by 8.5 per cent of the value of USD 4.83.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest producer of commercial aircraft and the closest competitor of Bombardier, announced a 10 per cent loss in quarterly profit on Thursday.
The lawyer who is dependent on cocaine, who warned the mob before the police investigation, is in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to transmit the information to the king of the sub-world of Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would turn out to be obvious.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
The cop who informed the drug mob about a major police investigation, because he feared that his drug addiction would turn out to be obvious, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had, after becoming suspected of cocaine use, handed over sensitive information about the investigation of his drug-related activities to the chief of the sub-species of Neil Scarbrough.
A lawyer whose nickname was "Bash" (party) who was criminally celebrated as the best legal representative was arrested at home in 2011 after a police check by Scarborough, who was arrested in previous drug cases.
The police watched Sarborough (32), leaving three bags of cocaine for dinner with their colleagues from the Law Society in Blackburn, Lancashire.
Based on the tests that found the traces of cocaine in his hair, his money and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of Class A.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he sought to obtain information about the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his partner.
All four suspects were then monitored in the context of a major investigation into trafficking in heroin and cocaine in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After during a series of police arrests, heroin and cocaine were held at approximately GBP 1.5 million together with GBP 200,000 cash, another 32 people ended up in prison with them.
Ditta (42) provided information to criminals from the fear that it would depend on cocaine.
Today Ditta, who works at Forbes Solicitors' legal firm in Blackburn, experienced a shameful moment before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of defending justice in two cases after a three-week appearance.
During his previous hearing, he admitted to holding cocaine.
The lawyer was found to have been in regular telephone contact with Ditto in February 2011.
Two detective suspects followed him, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and watched him put his 60 percent clean drugs under lawyers' basket in a black golf cart.
Next he was Scarborough with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home where the drugs were found, and nine conversations were held between the two.
The court found that there were traces of Class A drugs in his hair, money and on his credit cards and that Ditta was "a regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was arrested later, but he refused to use cocaine, and said that he spoke to the suspect dealer because he was his client, and argued that their conversation fell into "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to issue a number of credit cards, but all of them were detained and his hair samples were taken.
In a police investigation, he said that he was operating an office both at his home address and at his workplace, and that his clients were visiting him on the job at home.
However, the court heard that after the key arrests, he contacted important players in the drug supply chain, some of which he had previously represented to tell them what detectives know about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "Who else knows that he must not violate the law than the legal representative in the criminal field."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a legal representative and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his talks were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the regular relationship of a client lawyer.
The police investigation dreamed of how much he could allow them to continue in their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't bring his profession of good reputation, but he rejected it.
With some of his clients he got too close, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be disrupted.
Ditta refused and declared: “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I wanted to share information with Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but I would do it right away.”
However, after hearing the police inspector Lee Halstead from Lancashire said: "Mr. Ditta became a criminal himself at the time he started getting drugs from organised criminals."
Its dependence on cocaine has made it hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of organised crime groups, which have given it the task of collecting valuable information on police investigation.
The legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and must in public arouse confidence and feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide himself behind his profession.
The Unit for Serious and Organized Crimes in Lancashire led against Mr. Ditt's investigation, on the basis of which he was also convicted for three cases of holding cocaine and now for preventing the execution of justice, which demonstrates our obligation to bring the criminal before the court.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and put you in front of our courtroom.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of co-existence for the purpose of supplying heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five persons involved in trafficking were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website Ditta arranged an online conversation about himself, in which he said that his dream work would be lawful to represent clients from the death block in America as a guest at dinner would like Mohammed Ali and as a motivation for the work he introduced inequality.
He was talking about the government with Klaus and Shpidla.
Now the men of Jan Kasala sent against Babish.
In the elections, the people received 14 MPs, so only a third of the number of social democrats or UN representatives.
But they enter the government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to grasp the borders of possible coalitions, Jana Kasala - a man who made the conditions for government participation in the years 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats and Andrey Babish don't have such a matador on their side.
This will probably be the first negotiation this time in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"Experience was minimal then," Kasal estimates how this year's talks will develop.
Kenyan press under controversial media law
"It is a horrendous report and it is on-the-spot to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply losing the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the newspaper quoted the draft law as anti-constitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director-General of the Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of the most unrecognised independent announcements and reporting websites.
He said that the new media court "will always be assumed because it is extended by the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Keni's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to the Star Journal, the bill's proposal actually passed to the government "full control over the media" and the standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom are being declared in Kenya "insulted a hard wound", and they criticise the bill as "insult".
The adoption of a draft law comes in the middle of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately following the September attack by the Islamic shooter at the Westgate Shopping Centre.
The wrath of the authorities turned to the Kenyan media when she posted a security camera on which soldiers were allegedly in need of luxury goods.
The police director responded by allowing two journalists and the head of the media to be called to the poll, but the call was later made after the press.
According to the new draft law, media companies can be affected by up to 20 million Kenyan Shillings and individual journalists up to one million together with the risk of "listing out" or can be denied official press accreditation.
The Tribunal shall also have the right to entertain the property of the debtor if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “there is also one shot enough to kill most of the radio stations”.
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidation effect on what is called the Kenyan "live blogosphere".
Politicians know that when they shut up the media, they can do without fear what they want.
"You never know what can happen," wrote a journalist in National Mutum Mathiu and described Kenyan media as a key source of mutual control and balance in public life.
"When we leave it in politics, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya were in the past a public criticism.
In May, they voted for the abolition of the fines imposed by the national wage agency and for the restoration of their fats around 532,000 unwrought shillings a month, which is the highest in the world.
He's got to slow down, young Czechs know.
Most of them don't even know what they're up to.
More and more Czechs give money to each other.
However, they do not belong to champions in the region.
For the most part, the Rakušan, who spends 181 euros a month, are stored on the side of the bank.
About something more than Czechs burn people in Slovakia.
This results from the Erste Savings Barometer survey in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the audience's mood is improving, and two thirds of the respondents are planning to give themselves more money.
While the Czechs are almost in the middle of the grid, people in Romania and Serbia still use very little.
For example, almost every other Serb, according to the survey, will burn the house under the pillow.
This year, the number of those who spend a month on higher amounts has risen.
Every month, as many as 2.5 thousand crowns of 26 per cent of the respondents, this year it's five per cent more.
The average monthly contribution in the mid-year comparison but decreased slightly to 2078 crowns.
The biggest hit among combustion products is pension insurance.
This predates 54% of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate resistance for only 36% of people.
On the contrary, the structure of the construction project is declining, and the interest on the investment funds has also fallen significantly last year.
You're only using 16 percent of the respondents, while last year it was almost a quarter of the people.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to burn, most of them do not know how much they achieve in individual products.
First of all, young people under 30 don't know how their money is raised.
On the contrary, the best knowledge of the effectiveness of its savings has the oldest group of respondents, among people over 50 years of age, 73 percent of those questioned.
In the international comparison of the Erste Czech group, they lead to the use of online banking, which regularly uses 44% of people.
They are followed by the Slovaks and the Rakushans with a 12% discount.
The UN celebrates the new goals of combating poverty
The United Nations is beginning to work without delay on a new set of goals that replaces the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
Before the UN's Summit on Sustainable Development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the launch of the "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDG, whose validity expires in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Mr. Ki-mun said at the summit that now is the time to "get acquainted with national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process, which is intended to establish the general objectives of sustainable development – SDG," he said.
The SDG will build on the progress achieved under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I shall make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realize our vision of the objectives of sustainable development, which it puts forward in the success of the MDG.
Mozambique's security concerns are escalating due to the conflict of strong personalities
Under the socho of Samory Machely, the Mosamby President of the Founder, thousands of people met in the center of Maputa to hold peace passwords at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
Out of fear of the future of its country, the company changed its clothes for a shirt decorated with the letter "we demand security" in Portuguese and joined the post office of independence in the capital on Thursday.
Within two weeks, reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party came almost daily, about one of the worst flows from the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an unrecognizable rebel, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then the government of the apartheid in South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of that country.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that the country will reopen an open conflict, but recent events have prompted foreign investors and locals.
The economy is rapidly growing, as the discovery of extensive coastal reserves of oil and carbon deposits in the north-west can be brought over several years from companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy Eni and the US Anadarko, investment worth more than $50 billion.
The ruling party Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo, each other, blame each other for the tension that arose.
The Renamo party claims that the government has triggered the latest conflicts by initiating an attack on their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional province of the Renamo Party.
The violent attacks of the former rebels followed when government forces attacked on the basis of Renamo and tried to kill Afons Dlakam, the leader of the group, said for the Financial Times speakers of Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government accuses Renamo of leaving the conflicts, because he has attacked the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza was trying to ease the concerns of instability.
Mr. Guebuza for the French press office AFP said on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a "stress" who wanted to use "everything left of his strength to try to prove that the government could order its own decision".
Like Frelimo, Renamo claims they want to avoid war.
However, concerns grew when Mr. Mazangy was quoted as saying that the Renamo side is derogating from the 1992 peace agreement.
The letter FT said he thought the Frelimo party no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the discussion, but seriously," said Mr. Mazanga.
The previous discussions between these parties have been made to mitigate the tension between these parties, which has been revitalized with a number of flows this year, just a little.
It is a charm between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), the lecturer at the Open University and expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon said.
Neither one of them is a good negotiator, nor is one of them prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which has applied for election changes, has already stated that it would boycott the municipal elections planned for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an effort to obtain the benefit from the government and the financial burden.
The electoral share of Renamo has decreased since 1992, while the latest party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by the former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza, whose second term of office ends next year, wants to destroy democracy in this country.
"The democratic system does not want more parties, does not want transparent elections, does not want peace, because it does not want to leave the presidential office," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what the Renamo party has, but it has carried out vicious terrorist attacks at the police station and on vehicles on the key road between the north and the south.
Most of the routes were reached in Sofala Province, which is a few hundred kilometers away from Maputo capital, but where the city of Beira, a port on which the companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, are operating coal.
In June Rio stopped for about a week of use of the railway when Renamo threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to ask himself if Renamo was repeating his threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and recent recovery.
"People think that the responsibility for the country's future lies exclusively with the government and the president and that he should be the one who finds the solution of the problems," he says.
Demonstrant Omar Sultuan says people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, want free access to the road," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as "models for the way of life," says the author.
The stories about Thora can show that “a rough force cannot be equal to the smart lstivities”, while artushov’s legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of myth would be "for school education to be too wild, to be too scandalous and in some cases to be too obsessive," said Crossley-Holland, who advocated a careful choice of age.
"I think it's great that myths and human creation are already part of education," he said.
I've been spying on this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly instructive” authors and teachers are in entertaining stories with a “encouraged” message for children as “applicant”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated from English the bishop of Beowulf and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Barriers, says: "You can have good intentions, but you will do better if you leave them for yourself."
Perhaps the greatest difference between the adult author writing for adults and the adult author writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or ended with a happy ending, but there must be a natural sense for good and evil.
And he must be aware; revealed through the story, not openly determined.
The old truth is it's better to show it than to describe it.
The Brno Star takes visitors to space in a new digital
At first glance, it is obvious that the large planetary Hall has changed in the last half of the year.
There's a new show here, visitors can take a look at the new comfortable seats, and above their heads came the projection area of an average of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, the new projector from Japan.
To be a perfect picture, there are other smaller designers in the room scattered.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the hall.
"It is about twenty-one computers that generate the image," said the director of the brunette star Jiří Dušek.
Computers will make sure that the image from several projectors is not covered, but gave a fine impression.
"The performance of computers is thirty-four times higher than in classical personal computers," said the star technician Tomáš Hladík.
The digitalium can exacerbate extremely realistic and plastic models of night skyscrapers, human bodies or ocean bottoms.
The viewers are so humid in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the star plans to produce purchased order and its own design in the room.
There are two lines on the program since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People in it will learn about the training of cosmonauts, fly into space, cling to the centrifuge, and then see in the visual examples how the conditions of the astronaut in the head space are challenging.
The second order is for children and its name is Kauoka'hina.
It will tell the story of a drought, where the pestrobarians lived a calm life until the outbreak of a nearby snake.
The entire digitalium was about fifty million crowns, which were paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the star from its budget also contributed by small amounts.
The projection area was ten million crowns, the projector of twelve million.
"The rest of society's audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the star passed two years ago.
According to Director Duška, between 25 and 30 thousand visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
We've been studying 11 TlSlCs!
We know where they want you to go to work!
In November last year, the analysis caught over 11,000 ads offering jobs, 4300 of which were published in the daily press and 6800 ads (62 per cent) on the Internet.
The Internet thus becomes the most important media for publicising job offers.
In 2005, when the first research was carried out, it accounted for 26 per cent.
In the last two surveys (2007), about 60 percent were established.
Indications of job opportunities in itself, according to a significant analysis, reflect the current situation on the labour market.
For example, a simple comparison of the number of ads published during the period of economic prosperity and during the economic crisis can be.
For example, in 2007, nearly 25,900 ads were published in the same follow-up period, which in 2012 was less than half.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented to a narrower, especially a more qualified group of professionals.
On the contrary, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those of the workers, the author of Pavlín Šłastnová’s analysis.
The representation of selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, the front seats of advertisements were set up looking for managers and managers, trade representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or managers of small businesses was only on the Internet.
In today’s press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, rather than large representations, especially of professional and professional professions.
Of course, the most frequently stated requirements expressed by employers through the advertising offer are education.
Another area was the knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, a requirement for the knowledge of a foreign language was made in three percent of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only in two percent of advertisements employees demanded an active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims on 'computer literacy' were found in 40 percent of advertisements (in the daily press in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
The requirements for practice are all linked to qualified professions.
This is particularly about leading production and other leading workers.
In the case of working professions, the author of the Jiří Tillner study complemented the mechanics and repairers or the manufacturer and the processor of foodstuffs or the repairer of electrical appliances.
Employers shall also, in half of their advertisements, lay down requirements on the characteristics and skills of potential beneficiaries.
The most frequently required skills in the first-place fire are already displayed in the communication skills for a long time.
In addition, employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, autonomy, responsibility, organisational capacity and reliability.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New Yorker Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be argued that New York City is the place where a solo comic show was born in America: almost a hundred years ago, the various artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the assembled people the jokes of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, the latest through a New York comedy festival.
The festival, founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the solo comedy Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – together with more than sixty performances in small clubs and big theaters.
"Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the extent that they are too large to play in the club," said Hirschová.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the exhibition of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the "Stand Up for Heroes" (to be built for heroes), the annual musical comedy performance at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be shown.
Just as this festival expanded, the world of comedy expanded.
Several comics from the festival this year came from non-traditional channels, such as show in smaller broadcasts or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has grown up with his seat (vessel pictant "League" on fantastic football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show at Comedy Central Station.
Jenny Slate was a member of both the "Saturday night live" program, and the "Parks and recreation", but the most popular was the "Marcel the shell with shoes on" video series.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comics with clearly recognizable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, ridery, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are a product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest players in the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a solo comedy, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he organized a TV show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is held in Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's whole work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he's here, sometimes he walks through the street between the two buildings, and he says, "Man, if I get all the money, maybe I'll live here."
The oil price went down to $96 for the barrel.
The price of oil on Friday continued to decline as the concerns of high stocks were weighed out by a report showing the strengthening of the Chinese manufacturing sector in energy yearning.
The US oil indicator for December deliveries during the late morning dropped in European electronic commerce at the New York trade fair by 14 cents at $96.24 per barrel.
On Thursday, 39 cents were reduced and 5.8 per cent remained in October for the month.
The rich oil supplies in the past few weeks have made it difficult for the price.
The Ministry of Energy said on Wednesday that the US stock has increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, the stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports on Chinese production led to a greater demand that showed growth in activity.
This indicates that China's economic recovery after growth, which has risen to 7.8% in the third quarter of the past two weak decades, could continue to grow.
Ropa Brent, an international oil indicator used also by the American refinery, fell at the London International Trade Exchange of 26 cents for $108.58 per barrel.
Not at all, Mr. Hasku.
We have a unique opportunity to show the politicians that they don't.
It is necessary to develop such a pressure so that Martin Hasek is free of all political functions and leaves the MP's mandate.
Any other solution reduces the level of political culture, which is already so complex.
Martin Hasek defends himself by the promise he has made, but everyone and politics in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what he can promise.
Trust is the only capital that politics has (Mr. Babi has the important one, of course it is the question whether it is politics).
The better program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he's retreating in politics.
Mr. Hasku, if you think this is good with this country (and your frequent statements set me up in it, if you just didn't - here you see how it's difficult to lie), you leave politics alone as a man.
Then people will accept your apology as an expression of the man who made a mistake and takes responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be considered as helpless weak ones, whose words and deeds cannot be trusted.
Whether you want to be proud, a missing person or a life shadow.
It may seem to you that it is unfair when I speak to you only, but you are the leader and they are only the beloved sheep.
And you're a leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you are now trying to close your ears for a while, reassess your strength, dissipate your shame and then attack again, but this is how parties or subjugates are being treated.
You are, I repeat, in my eyes the leader, the alpha male, so behave.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The Court has blocked the regulation concerning the procedure for the arrest and search of persons by police in the NY
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked the court regulation requiring changes in the arrest and search programme for persons in the New York police department and the court dismissed the case.
The second U.S. appeal court said that Judge Shiry Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the appeal decision given by the city.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution so that it had implemented its programme of halting and questioning people.
The city of its conclusions and its correctional regulations were intended, including the decision to assign supervisory oversight, which would help the police department to change its procedures and its training programme associated with them.
The appeal court heard the arguments for the requested postponement on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal said that the judge had to be dismissed from the case because she was in conflict with the rules of procedure for the judge, and that as a judge, she did not act as a judge to avoid the opinion of the firm, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and a public statement that she openly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly focused on blacks and Hispance in their program of stopping and searching for persons.
It has established independent oversight to monitor major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and supervision, and has ordered the launch of the pilot programme for the purpose of testing the cameras carried on the body in some areas where the most frequent arrest occurs.
In August, New York agreed to terminate the storage method of names and addresses of people whose cases were refused after police searches.
The oral reasons for the withdrawal of the city are sometimes planned after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching persons have criticized a number of civil rights defenders.
In some forms there has been a halting and searching of persons for some decades, but the recorded searches under the management of independent old-age Michael Bloomberg dramatically increased to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, mostly about blacks and Hispance.
In 2004, four men, all of them among the minorities, wrote a complaint that became the case of the group complaint.
The founders of the amendments to the Stop and Search Program by the NY police department claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police unit and can influence how these procedures are used by other police departments.
The opponents claim that the changes are reducing police morale, but not crime, and that this is causing money to melt, but does not solve a wider problem when the police force is under pressure after the last decade has reduced its numbers by several thousand.
The judge noted that she did not complete the practice of stopping and searching for persons who were constitutional, but reformed the way police department looked at the NY.
Five shopping centers are facing low attendance
It comes from the data of Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle's real-life consulting companies.
In the Prague Bohnicas, the public will open the Krakov Shopping Centre, which will be the 19th Prague Shopping Centre.
In the Czech Republic, there are now a total of 90 major shopping centres.
The dissatisfaction is about 20 percent of the medium-sized and large centres.
The main problems are inadequately large center towards the locality and poor layout, so too much pattern or complicated and unrecognizable matching, possibly dead center," Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield said.
Also, according to the leading retail property department Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about five shopping centers are facing low attendance.
Among the main reasons are poor transport availability, low income categories of local residents or market overcrowding in a given place.
Some projects have opened almost completely observable, but their results have been largely unsatisfactory at first.
Today, customers are somewhat conservative and hate to change their shopping habits.
The new shopping centre has to try more to "luck" its customers on new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing," Samadi added.
The volume of shopping centres is generally stable, according to Sotáka, even in some centers, because the tenants were willing to lower the rent and hire some units in the crisis.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently been opened which are not fully occupied and the average volume so reduced (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantovka in Olomouci)," Soták added.
The shopping malls opened in the last two years are being held on the market according to Sylvie Samadi very slowly.
But there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of sites suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see space for building a project that would serve the people of Prague 6.
In the market, there is certainly room for the construction of smaller local projects, called 'convinence centres', aimed at purchases and services of daily needs for residents living in the immediate environment," Samadi said.
According to Sotaka, there is also a place on the domestic market for other shopping centers.
And both for the small 'service' centre, for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or for expansion in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, Czech Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague, you can see the space for the prepared shopping center at the Victory Square, and you can see the clear potential of the street Na Příkopě and Václavské Square.
"The expansion of retail parks that allow traders to cover and expand to more and more less cities for favourable rental and operating costs, space is also still in some locations for smaller local or local shopping centres, and their reconstructions such as the reconstruction of the Prior business houses, which are looking for a good location," Dita Kubánková from DTZ added.
The Czech Republic currently has 90 modern shopping centres with a total of more than 2.2 million meters of square rough rented areas.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, comes from the data of Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is on the EU average, compared to the values of Britain and France, leaving the Czech Republic about 50 square metres per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson got on the phone to check on the guy.
The former editor of news News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods "to address the telephone, monitor and confrontation", to confirm the subversive type of a loving relationship that the former Minister of Interior Charles Clarke had to be involved in.
State Representative Andrew Edis at the Old Bailey court said that the news of the World caught a false report in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The news was entrusted to private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to get into Paulby's voice box and go into her private, but the court found that Coulson had called her and left her a voice message.
"The state representative indicates that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a person standing in front of the house and hoping that people are caught out, but a person who likes to draw up stories to see what they say," said Edis.
He said the NotW newspapers used three ways to examine stories: getting on the phone, tracking and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Of course he knows about the second, tracking, he needs to know about it.
What about the first one?
Does she know about getting on the phone?
He says no, we say, "But he certainly knows."
We are talking about the loving relationship that Clarke is involved in, were first captured by the news report section of NotW, when the source, who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby, was said, "You're wasting your time, it's with Charles."
A record of the voice reports received from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at the Mulcairo House in August 2006.
The investigators also found records in the computer of a private investigator, where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were named "Projects".
During the time that Mrs. Paulby was investigated, her parents received anonymous phone calls in which information about Paulby was requested, said Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup were watching Mrs. Pawlby's movement.
Coulson left her on 18 June 2005 with a voice message saying, "I got a story that we're going to publish tomorrow and which I would like to talk to Charles very much about."
Mr. Edis says that the involvement of Coulson in the story was according to the same model as in other important personalities, including former Interior Minister David Blancett.
In court on Thursday it was announced that Coulson confronted Mr. Blancett for a loving relationship with a married woman, while he saw himself with Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks refused to communicate with other persons for the purpose of telephone contact between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have confessed to getting on the phone.
The disclosure of NSA increases the public monitoring paranoia by the State
One day at the end of August, a German police helicopter ran over the US consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Spolska Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic reporting agency, the mission was to arrange a photograph of the cover of the US security guard, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media argues that the BfV has hoped that it will be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this action has left Berlin an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers.
In September, the US director of national reporting again insisted that the United States do not use its foreign reporting options "to steal the commercial secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, who became a co-worker as an informer, began to discover his valuable collection from the undercover surveillance of the United States, the European government and the leading entrepreneurs no longer know if they should trust the words of the director.
After reports that the US National Security Agency carried out espionage in Brazil's oil company and obtained access to data available by US cloud suppliers including Google and Yahoo, it achieved a general paranoia of state monitoring of new dimensions.
The last drop came to reveal that Angely Merkel's office phone might have been listened to for ten years.
If it can be the most powerful person in Europe, then they are certainly potential entrepreneurs.
Snowden has reviewed intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the EY Advisory Service, German companies are convinced that as far as industrial espionage and data theft is concerned, the US is now at the same high risk as China.
However, there is no evidence that the United States has transmitted the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies in the whole of the document revealed by Mr Snowden.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and stated that it should try to reduce its dependence on the USA:
The leading entrepreneurs are skeptical about this.
From the German Parliament, the votes are calling for us to produce a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open them again slowly...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, he didn't have to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is affected, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except IT industry.
The scope and technical feasibility of the American spy agencies discovered by Snowden is for some companies that have even thought that China is the greatest threat to monitoring, but shocking.
There is a large turnout in cloud computing technology, where European representatives have come to realize that data stored in the United States fall under dark jurisdiction, and that is why they are potentially offensive.
According to a survey carried out by the Trade Community Cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of the non-American members after the US Program was discovered, the Data Exchange cancelled the plans to use the cloud supplier based in the USA.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP's CEOs, says, "We have a new question here for customers who haven't been here a year ago - where my data are stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German high-level actors argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to suppress their most valuable secrets and that data must be protected at all costs.
It's not surprising that economic espionage is being carried out.
It's always been.
“It’s a key topic for many years and it hasn’t changed significantly during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Director General of BASF Agrochemicals.
The Americans are carrying out espionage at business and industry level, just as we are carrying out espionage on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Entrepreneurships generally do not want to be covered by countermeasures that have made it impossible for the attacker to benefit.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB drive or leaving an unprotected notebook in the hotel room is not reasonable at all.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a representative of the Audi car, says that it has been a practice for many years to gather before a mobile phone show so that it can not be used as a listening device.
The German office of BfV advises the leading workers to consider whether to use simple prepaid mobile phones abroad because of the risk that smart phones can be denied.
The prepaid mobile phones will then be released.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany many of these companies in their specific areas are the leading representatives of the global market.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access," cautions in its report BfV.
The United States is warning its own companies against economic espionage from other countries.
According to Washington's post US National Intelligence Estimate, in February France, alongside Russia and Israel, a second set of perpetrators involved in the hacker's activity for economic reporting, which is immediately behind China.
A member of the Council in a German risk-free company concluded that in the case of economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency DCRI, said this month in one of the talks: “Services know very well that all countries, while working together in the fight against terrorism, carry out espionage on their allies.”
The parents of an unfavourable boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of the unfavourable boy from Georgia whose body was found inside the dirty play spirit in his secondary school believe that their son was murdered, the family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11 in a fine church behind the courts in the gymnasium where he went.
The sheriff's investigators from Lowerdes County have concluded that Johnson died by an accident, but the family of a 17-year-old refuses it.
"They are firmly convinced that their son was murdered," said lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed that he died just as the sheriff said.
"They are convinced that it resists logic, physical laws and also healthy understanding," said Crump.
They feel that it should be avoided what really happened to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he came back to them for dead," he said.
State Representative Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting a regular investigation into Johnson's death, and noted that several key issues remained unrestrained.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of a crime?
He announced Moore at the press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll keep an eye on the fact that they're going to tell me anywhere.
My goal is to find the truth.
"I think there is a sufficient basis for regular investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original drink indicated that Johnson died as a result of "serious shock".
According to Moore, however, the second drink led to another cause of death.
"There are a number of questions that must be answered or confirmed here," he said.
Moore added that if, in the case of Johnson's death, he finds sufficient evidence to order an investigation of a criminal offence or a violation of civil law, he will request the FBI and its enforcement.
The deputy sheriff from the county of Lowdes was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
A judge from South Georgia in the middle of the offices ordered that all the videos from the surveillance cameras be made available to the investigators.
Parents of youth hope that video recordings will contain a clue leading to the discovery of their son’s death.
CDC Centre issued guidelines on child allergy for schools
In the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), a package of guidelines has been issued to help in the case of children's allergies to food at school.
This is the first set of directives issued by the U.S. government because the number of children of school age suffering from food allergies is rising.
One of the 20 children in the United States has an allergy to food.
The CDC Centre found that food allergy in children rose by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
For schools, the guidelines contain information on how to make teachers and staff aware of children's allergies to food and how to react to allergic reactions if it occurs.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline – the most frequently used automatic epiPen injector – to be able to react to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State law authorities have recently updated the rules that allow schools to store adrenaline simpler.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that occur in conversations with children who have allergic reactions.
The child can say, "It's like someone's touching my tongue," "I feel like I have hair" or "I know my tongue".
Parents of intersexual children can choose “uncertain sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise a third sex in children born with an uneven sex arrangement.
Newborn children will no longer be counted only for male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to introduce any sex for such children and allows them to introduce sex as "unspecified" or "unspecified" on their family lists.
The aim of the law is to stop pressure on parents so that their child will be surprised to decide for an operation for the purpose of determining sex and to combat discrimination against those who are intersexual.
According to the BBC, after many years, one intersexual person said, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'll stay a slatanine-created doctor, brainwashed and discovered.
It is estimated that every year, 2000 children are born to one who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of the group of about 60 realities that fall within the diagnosis of sexual development disorder, which interferes with the term for those with atypical chromosomes, sexual glands (military or vertebrate) or unusually developed genitalia.
Intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
The definition of sex is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that if sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best available information and to identify them, instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of the child until the operation is carried out if at all.
New York Psychiatr Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender issues, said that the new German law "seemed like a good thing".
Intersexual children are ethical dilemmas.
"Some people are in a life threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children don't," he said.
The definition of sex can be carried out without surgery and can then wait for the identity to develop.
The knowledge of how sexuality develops in children is not too accurate.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a mystery, why some people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexuals as different from transsexuals or transgenders, because their status is not linked to sex but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as one of them.
These cracks may occur in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, spray and shape, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sexual organs, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination enjoyed by intersexual and transsexual workers, as well as the level of burden, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't fit any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to be identified in the official documents of the male, female or "third sex".
Norrie May-Welby, 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first-known "undeserved" person in June when she won a court appeal so that she could leave the status of "unjust" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, there will be German passports other than M (man) and F (woman) and third name, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighbouring France, according to the report on France, 24 gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this highly Catholic country signed petitions for the removal of "the theory of sex" from school textbooks.
The American Catholic website online also came out against German law and wrote: “With the way the world is drawn to a new state, when sex is the issue of choice, but sexual activity is not the case, we turn the ranks of two other pillars of civilization.”
One mother of Maryland's newborn also said to the Baby Zone that she would rather see children be given sex at birth.
"Familyhood alone is stressful without any other restrictions, especially if you do not know your child's sex," said the parent care website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female genders were called hermaphrodite, according to a prominent river that had two sexes.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was something like a table that could be hidden and crossed again.
But now many doubt the ethical basis of the operation by the fact that sexuality is a complex matter and doctors can sometimes decide wrong because they do not know how children will feel when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
Persistent theory of how to treat children with an unethical sex was presented by Dr. John Money at the University of Johnse Hopkins, who held the view that sex was submissible.
He created a new concept of "particularity" and argued that social causes and environmental impacts – as parents raised their child – affected the genes and hormones of children and created a child regardless of whether they were identified as men or women.
But in one case in 1966, known as "John/John", his theory became controversial.
The parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged by a miscarriage, recommended that their child be left to rot, removed his vertebrae, and brought up as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of change, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When he was 15 years old, he had to rearm the boy and marry his wife.
But in 38 years, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors "use this model" today.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these operations became “discontent with the result”.
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but an inconsequential sexual arrangement.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a big clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live a "satisfying life".
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from the external organs and varlates and was raised as a girl.
At 12 years of age, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," said ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
He was sent to the 18th floor.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrible.
After my birth, I was sterilized, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DSD), which protected the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its sexual organs.
After he learned the truth, he turned back to his husband, took the doses of testosterone, and let himself remove the strains,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today, others are represented in the organisation called the Interface Project and try to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattisová, the director of the legal group Advocates for informed choice (representatives of informed elections) is concerned that the German law "calls for checks and stigmatisation".
“Many activists are worried that the German law will achieve that it will encourage parents to make a quick decision and choose “uncertain” child,” she said.
We're afraid he's going to get it for intervention.
We think it's better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law ends up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex".
"The adults should be able to make their own decision on the legally valid sex," she said.
The German law is about to grant it at birth.
It's a battle a little kid shouldn't have had right now.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh chest radiologist, who has a daughter with sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in a supportive group, said that the German law "gives authority" to both parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called an insecurity syndrome for androgens.
Because her androgen receptors are toxic, they evolved from Katie's female rhinestones.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have a factory or an egg.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married, and she works as an intern at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or replacement motherhood.
"The law gives parents some space so that they don't make their decision quickly," Baratz said.
It gives them time to carry out certain tests and think about it and gives them time before they write "man" or "woman".
In this respect, everything is fine – you raise and love your child.
You have a wonderful child, and you're happy.
You don't have to hurry with an operation that's non-refundable.
"It allows the child to be involved in decision-making and to take away the stress that parents are bound to, because they are not sure that they are doing the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he is more attuned to – and that is a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The cook poured the whole house with gasoline: he threatened to burn it with his own family!
The tension went up, the fear went up.
The man started threatening to burn the whole house.
Instead, all available police surveillance in the area, as well as a unit of firemen from Mladé Boleslav and a unit of voluntary firefighters, were carried out.
A police negotiator also came to the scene, who tried to talk to a man about his irrational behavior.
The man kept threatening to burn the house.
That's how she had to get into the house by an intruder unit that destroyed and sped.
Aggressor then ended up investigating a juvenile hospital where he was transferred to an anti-alcoholic arrest station.
After all, the Hassichs, a house with petrol, fell asleep by a sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition, all domestic animals were saved from the house.
He didn't give a man to a police negotiator, so he got his command.
Report: Obama's campaign considered changing Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisor, according to the New York Times, secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton from 2012.
This revelation is the most important sensational book on the 2012 campaign from Mark Halperin and John Heilemanna "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times magazine received a copy of the coming books and announced on Thursday evening that the president of the top collaborators had arranged an intensive group meeting and research at the end of 2011, to assess whether the rescue of Biden would help bring Obama's bright hope of re-election.
According to the national-political writer for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of leading officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely the former head office of Bill Daley's White House, to measure the impact of the move on elections by former foreign ministers to the post of Vice-President Clinton.
The potential change was a tight-shocked secret within the Chicago infrastructure of the campaign and inside the Oval work.
Only a few of the president's closest advisors – including Daley, former head of Obama's campaign Jim Messin and former chief advisors at the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The book "Double down" claims that Daley was the representative of the attempt to replace Biden despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to do this when data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would not significantly increase the chances.
In a conversation with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I have carefully examined a number of things, and this was one of them," Daley said in a letter.
You must not forget that at that time the president had a terrible appearance, so we said, "Christian, what are we to do?"
While Daley described research as "the appropriate care", Martin told Anderson Cooper from CNN that the campaign for re-election had set up a small investment to find out if this move would be paid out in elections.
"The campaign does not pay such money for elections and qualitative research unless something is really taken seriously," Martin said to AC360.
However, it is not clear if Obama knew that his team considered this exchange.
Martin told CNN that Daley was wondering if his then boss knew about this potential card mixing.
While Daley said he did not think that the president had any potential changes "was aware", the former chief office admitted that it was "possible", that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double down" definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe had reached Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought that Obama didn't know about the investigation regarding the expulsion of Biden from the candidate.
"Maybe," answered Martin.
A fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman produced the first ice cream that shines in the dark – using the meduce.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescence properties of this marine animal and developed a shining palm tree.
The idea came to mind when he read a professional mediocre, and he convinced scientists in China to make chemical proteins that lead to lightning.
This ice cream reacts with the language of the consumption – increases pH in the protein and then causes it to shine.
Chris says the ice is shining when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and that's why the more you lie, the clearer it is.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious" (oil me, taste great), says: "It's a wonderful substance, but when it comes to production, we're at the beginning, so you'll get about 2 g for GBP."
The protein we use in the freezer is reacting with your language at neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats protein, the pH increases and the ice starts to shine.
We've been testing it for the last few months and it seems to be a great idea for Halloween because it's causing this fantastic lightning effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because lighting the meduce is four times as expensive as gold.
And so every cup I've got is about 140 GBP.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company with its headquarters in Bristol is known for its non-traditional taste of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
His next product is supposed to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I would really like to make an invisible ice cream."
In fact, it's impossible because of the fracture of the light caused by the ice crystal that forms the ice, but I'm counting on some way to do it, we'll find it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescence properties of the medusa, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By number
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
We were able to eat sweets with our sister, stay up for a long time, and take the neighbors on a dress.
Today I feel like I'm worried.
After two years, there was no sugar in my apartment, and this year it probably won't be different.
However, statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween is concerned, black sheep.
According to the State Small Trade Federation (NRF), Halloween will celebrate this year most Americans – in fact 158 million – and will lose a total of $6.9 billion for sweetness, costumes and jewelry.
But every time I look forward to Halloween, there are trends.
According to the NRF, $ 6.9 billion of lost dollars is expected to go 1.2 billion on costumes.
This year are the last shot of fashion sexy non-living objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; sex can also be food like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As far as man is concerned, I expect us to see a lot of zombies due to the origin of the dead, and I bet that space men from Daphpunk will be able to reach our channels in Instagram this year.
According to Google, these are the most sought after zombie costumes, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year, we dressed our dogs in costumes, and we weren't the only one in my breath.
In fact, according to the NRF, the U.S. will spend $330 million on animal pet costumes this year.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweetness, we're not wasting our time.
According to Nielsen, US loses $1.9 billion.
It's about 300 million kg of Hershey table, lizatak, sweet milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark's ink.
This is a wonderful report for 41 million collaborators who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to cross our quarter.
In fact, we're buying during Halloween, and don't believe and consume 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn beans, and yet according to the National Association of Sugars around Halloween sells almost 16,000 tons.
That's about 9 billion individual corn beans.
It's a secret I've never solved.
Nothing's more typical for Halloween than scary houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror beyond the walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are in the United States, officially dedicated 1200 scary homes that, according to the American scary home, earn $500 million, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you're afraid of and that your friend is giving on Facebook, and you can't remove them and the person you like, will look at the picture and write down the comment as “you’re looking at.”
And finally, there's a little bit of dynamism.
When we were young, Charlie Brown introduced us to a great day (Great Pumpkin) and cutting down the Danish lighthouse is something like winning the Christmas tree – we're doing it from the little one.
Luckily for us the trend "child in day" began thanks to Pinterest's application only last year, so most of us grew up to cut the tissue instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. People's Estimates Office, U.S.A. loses about $106 million.
The tin lamp with a mist flat on your front porch is likely to come from Illinois, where 245 thousand tons of daylight grew this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from the city of Napa in California and try to cut their teeth weighing almost one tonne.
A series of competitions of Land Rover
The interior has race seats and six-way safety belts as well as intercoms.
The selection includes improved brakes, a service pack that ensures access to Bowler Works machines, logistics support and coordination of the vehicle between individual races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The participants in the competitions coming to Bowler have changed."
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure as well as a reachable way to world class races.
We are pleased that we can offer them this journey in collaboration with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various race disciplines in Britain and the sea, and that it prepares competitions for the toughness and reality of Rally Raid races.
The development of the Defender Challenge car is a truly exciting competition.
In addition, Defender Challenge will offer school and testing day in February and also the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have a preliminary election here for two years
The president of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting another early elections.
The week after the last talk for Current.cz said that there is no other way out, and every government will vote last Friday and Saturday is impossible as a blind man.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, saying that the life span of the starting election period is estimated to be two years.
With the objection that the voters will choose a completely different choice next time, they do not agree, "I think it will be a little more balanced decision."
At the same time, the president of TOP 09 does not accept that his party could still lose voters as this year in other elections (approximately 300 thousand votes in 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if within two months it is clear that the early elections will be, it will strengthen the movement of the ANO 2011 Andreje Babiše.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babi will lose.
The turbulence situation in the ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after a hidden meeting of the part of the party's leadership, declared that social democracy would remain either him or Michal Hasek, comments Schwarzenberg after his:
"The leading officials of the democratic party, as small boys go to the head of the state, to allow them to go back to the side."
"I thought Mr. Hasek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I haven't seen anything so stupid in my life," said President TOP 09.
And in the direction to President Zeman (who was shot at in the fight for the presidential function), he said, "The role of the state's head is clear: he wants to strengthen the party."
The first laws have already been submitted to TOP 09.
What was the most surprising choice for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws, including the French Register of Treaties, which had been discussed before the elections, but with the early elections he had fallen under the table.
President TOP 09 in the conversation for Current.cz claims that such speed is given by "these laws are needed".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 obviously wants to pass similar attempts on the other side.
For example, ANO election leader Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election struggle of introducing the "deprived" program of the ANO contract register.
TOP 09 now used the jump - just outlined the proposal that had already been made to the second reading of the snow.
The Hasian units came to rescue the lost dog, which hung 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous surface in the stone.
The bastard Ruby ran off after a little car accident.
Three days later she was imprisoned in a stone mill by a man who was evicted by a dog.
The Hassichians went down the rock wall to save the dogs from certain death.
The shield was released by fire units that came to release it after somehow stuck themselves on a dangerous base in a stone mine 15 meters above the ground.
Nine months later, Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and he survived for three days on his own until he was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
His owner, Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in the Stoneologist Flappit in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he ran away when he got into a small accident, a fever followed his lost dog and put challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday, at 2:15 p.m., a white dog caught up with Ruby on a cliff 15 meters above the ground.
Instead, he rushed a technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station and flew down to free Ruby, using his pickup to pick up the animal transport bag.
The technical rescue team chief Andy Clayton said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
He was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the bottom.
When he was saved, he did not move the door – he was totally frozen.
But he's fine now.
Then he got the sussans.
It was a very unusual ride.
The fact that the dog's been cheating is incredible.
The technical rescue team chief Peter Lau said: "Ruby had great happiness during his escape."
There was a possibility that he would be seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet at the checkpoint, and besides exhausting and dehydration was fine.
Ms. Hallová from Halifax in West Yorkshire said, "In view of the rescue action, I was afraid."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to keep him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
The Hassians did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, they were all just amazing.
Mr. Alderson from Keighley added, "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
The masks were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that after that 18-year-old Katy Perry definitely didn't make it.
During an interview with the Australian broadcaster, this pop star said this week that for Jagger's song "Old habits die hard" from 2004.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock vet and he went out after her.
She said, “It was a long time ago, and now she is very kind to me.”
In a statement from Jagger's (70) district representative, he said he categorically denied that he would ever make Katy Perry's proposals.
The representative said, "Maybe you're messing with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers (songwriter) who appeared this year on the Rolling Stones concert hall.
Her new album "Prism" started this week in the first place.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe Gives Scotland a Choice
The next day, another scary story about independence.
This time, a warning is given that the condition for membership of independent Scotland in the EU would be its accession to Schengen.
This led to stories of passport checks in Berwick and the rest of the road along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that Strathclyde's newspaper mentioned the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected – it did not happen to the headlines.
No one also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if they do.
Given that Scotland is not now in Schengen, the continuing dissatisfaction offer would be a ransom payment for Brussels for anything they really want from Scotland.
So it's a pretty bad story.
And it's so old that it's made a dig, and I've heard from the press that "independence means passport checks", at least 40 years ago.
Yet, in this voodoo talk, one interesting thought is hidden.
Why should independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why change the London chamois for that Brusselsish, especially now?
This is a real European story: a major military plan to unite Europe has finally been abandoned.
The impact of the euro crisis is officially the European project of the dead.
On the contrary, Europe has the influence of the parties to the EU-led resistance or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptic side for Germany – founded this year – came as if it had gone nowhere and already used nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, which from the Bundestag is the basis of Free Democrats (the equivalent of British Liberal Democrats).
On the home floor, there has always been a resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The resistance dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the emphasis on the national economy, has led many people to believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments having a high budget deficit – that was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is the euro system that blocks its members at the exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing domestic currency, southern Europe has an adverse effect on domestic production against Germany.
The only aid is to cut revenue and public expenditure – to which Germany is asking for it.
The current budgetary and monetary problems are a deeper cause of European retail performance.
As a result of the "green" energy policy supported by Brussels – a code for the support of French and German companies at consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for petrol than in the United States.
This is a paralysing disadvantage in cost as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Not all world-wide freezes would return to the sinking of the European petrochemical industry of cheap bead oil from the United States.
As a result, there is a strong opposition, especially in France, when the EU is in a hurry.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that will keep Germany in trust and enable Paris to build up in the world at Washington level.
Berlin, however, no longer needs Paris as an indication of political legitimacy and has promoted its own economic policy in Europe and left the French economy in its condemnation.
Result: The Right wing of Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, just won the main additional elections and removed the ruling socialists to third place.
The front is now with 24% of the most popular party in France – a timely warning to British laborers that they cannot judge that the accumulation of rights is automatically shown on the left.
How does Le Pen feel about his newly acquired popularity among the white class?
The next year's European elections would like to use the European Parliament to create an anti-European bloc against the common currency.
If anti-European parties say well in these elections, which is likely, such a block can be dominated first in the history of the European Parliament.
At the same time, I think that the growing anti-European sentiment and attitude towards the common currency will be linked and the euro will be lost.
The EU does not disappear, but it is becoming more freer in the sense of "European (Sovereign) nations", General de Gaulle has already given priority.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may be leaving the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the United States to withdraw from this project and join the United States.
However, Washington's increased interest in Tichomore indicates that Britain will be left for Atlantic cold.
Where's Scotland?
We can choose to be the area (in principle) of little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – it is also possible to announce to Berlin and Brussels when we are to be left behind.
I suppose that in a relaxed European organisation, Scotland would well assume that it would save its own money.
Cooperation with other similar countries would be easier in the non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and leave our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – buying – the most successful political move that did not bring about a protracted action in Europe, which was won by a large majority in 2011 due to the opposition to the plots planned (and implemented) by the Labour Office Alistair Darling and the following coalitions of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland had now chosen independence only to adopt a protracted measure dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Timed Puberta: Advanced
Research has shown that African Americans and Hispanics reach puberty before their whites.
Physical changes don't mean they're getting close to puberty.
There is no evidence that the hormones or other chemicals are behind it.
Experts say that an epidemic of obesity can be one of the triggers of early puberty.
The trend of early puberty is not so good for boys.
Former rapporteur CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Should a mother be afraid when her daughter begins breast growth and humiliation at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children's Doctors this week in Orlando, Florida, a paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time making sure my parents that it's usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," said Kaplowitz.
The visible signs of development, such as breast growth, abstinence to disgrace and in the underguard and body smell, appear in the girl earlier.
In the last 40 years, however, there was only a small movement at the age of the first menstrual period.
In the United States, the average age is 12,5 years, compared with 12,75 years in 1970.
"When I begin to develop my breast, they will expire at least two to three years before it comes to the first menstrual period," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem"
The most reliable test of how puberty continues is time.
It is discussed what triggers the actual onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by growth spores 8 years ago, the girl is considered to be "pre-educated".
In most cases, the process will be slowed down or stopped – which can be closely monitored by children’s physicians.
The faster growth can be the reason for the endocrinologist to carry out tests to eliminate serious problems such as cancer or cyst.
There are medical procedures that await early menstrual periods and prohibit other consequences: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to a halt to growth and maturity in adulthood.
The recommendations regarding medicines and hormonal treatment are dependent on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
There are also important psychosociological aspects.
With regard to the use of drugs, Kaplowitz is careful, but he acknowledges that “repression of puberty can alleviate the problems with the behavior of the girl and her feelings of being different from her peers”.
Understandably, there is another big problem: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstrual periods.
"They are worried that they can get pregnant, or how they can manage hygiene," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began to have a menstrual period of 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation together, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came from home school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a related set of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are on the market.
Boys – like girls – reach puberty early.
Kaplowitz suggests that the most serious reason is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study in girls aged 6 to 9 years, which connects body fat to the time of puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African Americans and Hispanics intend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, it seems that the patterns of early puberty are influenced by all possible economic conditions through the climate to the genes.
Another argument: Although in boys under the age of low, there is confusion in the face and on the face, the trend towards the full bloom of early puberty is not as obvious as it is in the girl.
Other doctors participating in the conference of the American Association of Children’s Doctors (AAP) added further complexity to this topic.
The acne and osprey of reproach is common even in the hips and battalions.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the true behavior of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist from the Goreebsk Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be obliged to receive instructions from their child’s doctor as to how to speak to their child.
"It may mean the need to talk to the child before you assume," Kalowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will likely respond well.
Girls who are developing earlier need to make sure that even if this happens early, this process is a part of life.
Naja Konvalink in the role of the host.
Does he have a new job?
Herečka Nadja Konvalinková (62) appeared behind her in the role of the housekeeper, and it was very much her.
That a popular Czech actress planned a change of profession and went to a hotel business?
Naza Konvalink found herself in James Joyce Irish pub and had a beer there.
I did it the first time in my life, and it just worked.
The boss even offered me a job and I could live with beer.
But I refused, I'd rather stay at what I'm doing to this day, at the heretic," she said with Konvalinkov smile, who was a guest at the twentieth anniversary of the functioning of the Irish house.
"I like Irish beer, and I'm going to have Irish whiskey in there," she said to herself.
Nadi, a long - term friend and colleague, was also present at the event.
I'm dead, and in my new life, I can't celebrate.
I'm allowed one beer or one pancake a day, and I'm trying to keep it," the actor added.
Manufacturers of the aircraft want the width of the seats, there are large orders in the pool
The second class of long-distance flight, which led to a serious exchange of views on the air show in Dubai, was a heated dispute between the leading aircraft manufacturers.
The subject of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for the long-term economic class — not exactly the ones that airlines would normally have preceded, but the space assigned is the key to the claims for efficiency in the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but the main American rival Boeing says they have to decide on this.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers competed in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine long-range aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the 17th to 21st November.
The way the last part of the plane is distributed – especially if it is 9 or 10 seats next to it – is the basis of the economic performance claims on the proposals of the new mini-jumbo aircraft.
Boeing says the improved "777X" model transports 406 people in economic headquarters with a width of more than 43 cm in 10 each row.
Airbus says that its A350 model competitive version will transport 350 people in 46 cm of wide economic seats distributed after 9.
Large airplanes often attack each other on technical issues through advertising in professional media.
Airbus now before an air show in Dubai, where it is expected that 777X will gain over 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently, he showed what might be the start of a new advertising war when he showed the financiers a video showing three people stuck in the restaurant with the title "You'd like it?"
"Boeing promotes long-term flights in the seat of the lower than in the regional turbortul aircraft," Airbus John Leahh said.
As the feeding habits change, people are bigger, but the seats in the aircraft have not changed radically.
Since the beginning of the 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, according to the U.S. Ministry of Health data, the average U.S. mass of between 40 and 49 years has increased by 10 per cent.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has 100 cm passports.
Airbus claims that his rival holds the concept of seats from the age of 50 when the average width of seats of newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims to have conducted a study indicating that the extension of the seat by 2.5 cm improves the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
The Boeing size of the seat of Airbus refuses and says it is not in the authority of the aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more issues than on the width of the seat.
“It is really about providing airlines with flexibility and enabling them to carry out the things they are convinced they have to do to be successful,” said an expert in the Kent Craver cabin area.
They don't want us to dictate to them what brings them profits.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For the traveller, there is a more basic space for the elbows, but for the supplier it is a growing problem that can affect the yield.
In the course of this dispute, the competition for scheduled aircraft with estimated trade in the coming decades is worth at least 700 billion dollars in catalogue prices, enough to raise the language of American and European exports.
As stated in July, the deployment of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim that they reach 20 per cent better performance than the leading market representative in this segment in their last proposals for two-engine long-range aircraft, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
The performance of Boeing depends partly on the comparison of the design of 777X with 10 seats in a row and the concept of 777 with 9 seats in a row.
The profit in unit costs is in contrast to the 10 seat concept.
"The reason for Boeing doing this is to speed up more seats and make its aircraft more competitive against our products," said Kevin Kenston, the director of the comfort of passengers in Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing models 777 are in line with the fact that many travellers are for a more dense distribution that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"Four-five centimeters wide seat would be great for the passengers, but the reality is that from a business standpoint, Airbus is a design designed to threaten the 777," said an expert at the Mary Kirby cabin interior, founder and portal editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer the airline a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
The air traffic controllers even carry a measuring belt with them to check the competitive arrangements.
All manufacturers also offer aircraft with a highly dense organisation for low cost companies and regional travellers while they are hungry.
Airbus offers model A350 with 10 seats in line, but says he hasn't sold it yet.
Up to now Airbus stressed the need for more cabin adjustment so that he offered a wider seat in the streets in some of his aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the challenge to new industrial standards will not be heard, but can be removed from the free sale of 777X.
The number of HIV-infected has exceeded the number of thousand in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected is increasing annually.
For example, in 2002 tests confirmed infections in 50 people, five years later they were 121 and 180 in 2010.
Last year, 212 were infected and it was a record number.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, I believe there is no doubt," said the expert on AIDS Miroslav Hlavatý, who has been leading the Prague Light House for patients for years.
According to him, there were 165 HIV patients in the country last year from January to September, while there were 176 in the same period.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV testing has been confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
In the Middle East, there were 206 people living in the village.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian region, 130 from Moravian-Sleezian or 116 from Ustsky.
At least the infected came from Highland, there were 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients were sexually infected.
Fourteen people in the past have been infected with blood transfusions.
However, since the beginning of the test, in more than a quarter of a century, the case has not been established in the Czech Republic.
The HIV virus also gave birth to six children, transferred to them from their mother.
The nonsense in the Gravitation film is, but it's a beautiful, hard-ass expert.
A fantastic film from the Gravitace universe sold some time after the premiere in the Czech cinema.
In October, he was seen by the Union film distributors of nearly 150 thousand spectators and made over 26 million crowns.
Most image rating reviews positive.
Others, however, find some inconsistencies in it.
The Lidovky.cz server asked experts from a number of astronomers and astrophysics about how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Star and Planetary Brno): I like science-fiction films that I consider to be modern, dream stories.
The film Gravitation doesn't stand out, even though it looks like a "physically real" performance.
No, but it doesn't mean he'd be bad.
I've enjoyed it a lot.
You can notice the hair of Sandry Bullock, who is not quite aware of the condition of the unhappiness.
Hubb's cosmic remote view and the International Space Station are moving in a very different direction, so they can't be seen in one shot.
Some film viewers calculate an unrealistic effect and even all the behavior of fire in a state of inactivity.
According to them, the scaffolders would also not endure such wounds.
Hrdins in the Gravitace film often get into a coliseum with different items and clothes without any major difficulties.
The criticism has not been saved.
So the extensive tragedy on the Earth's circular route is, according to some of the debaters, unrealistic.
She's also wondering why the doctor was sent to space to repair the technique.
People in forums also argue about "unreal" conduct.
She's acting like she's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Star and Planetary of Prague): I have seen him so far only on a wide scale, but clearly I can say, I have been fascinated.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost duty) not to adhere to the reality.
"More than the said incompatibilities touched me, how the space station with degrading level techniques (the last Chinese) has been shown three times."
"The Chinese will last until the end of the decade, and it'll probably look better than it's in the movie."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of Science of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, authors are very successful in trying not to break physical laws, and thus a naturally oriented viewer of assessment that in various cosmic collisions and collisions, the moment of flexibility is quite correct, said by the dictionary of physics, as well as the view on the Earth of space is very realistic including thin layers of atmosphere and polar radiation in polar areas.
Incompatibilities will certainly be found in a more detailed examination.
For example, when reading comments, I found that the preferred direction of the circulation of various space debris on the ordinary course appears in some scenes to be reversed before it should actually be (from the west to the east).
Jíří Štěpán (Astronomical Institute of Science of the Czech Republic): Some things the creators have contributed to their needs, but no key and no fault in logic or natural laws in the sky have I recorded in the film and compared to other films of similar intent it is seen that the creators have given themselves to the credibility of the events shown.
From moments that don't make sense, it's worth naming the fact that Hubble's universe's remote view is going on after a rocked orbit other than the ISS.
As a result, there is a marked difference in the speed of each other and the rescue operation could not actually be carried out as shown in the film.
Furthermore, at the moment of the Kowalska (Cloney) and Stone (Bullock) division, I did not notice that the whole ISS was rotating, so it is not a clear source of force working on Kowalski, which forces both actors to leave at a time when they are no longer moving towards themselves.
A new vaccine against nicotine can relieve the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse for life from nicotine dependence.
Before tests on people need to be carried out further tests, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says the first signs are good.
"We hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhaust all the methods available today, but have found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that all current approaches are overcome," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an undamaged virus that has been designed to contain genetic information for the formation of anti-inflammatory antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce the gas flow of these antibodies.
The antibodies follow all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, preventing the chicken from getting nicotine bites.
In the tests of a mouse vaccinated, added nicotine, they continued in their normal activity.
But mice that were not vaccinated "resolved," the researchers said, which means that nicotine got into their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given so often that sufficient levels of antibodies were maintained, so they proved to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because they convert liver cells into factory for the manufacture of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for people are completely safe, they could be given to children before they have the taste of cigarettes to taste, and that would be the case with nicotine.
However, it would be more likely that the chickens would use it to stop.
"I will know that once I start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine, they will have no benefit from it, and this will help them to escape this abuse," he said.
The British scientists said that the results were interesting, but they note that further research is needed.
Tripods refuse to be affected by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be examined by the State Monitoring Committee on Corruption.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied that he would change the policy of coastal rent at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on the government controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) extended its inquiry on Friday to see if Mr. Obeid was lobbying for several state ministers to be hired at Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and cafes, renewed without having to participate in the selection procedure after his exhumation in August 2005.
The Committee now examines the claim that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obei's hidden interests in these properties, on the basis of the evidence submitted on Thursday by the former representative of Mr. Tripodi's leading office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the 2005 negotiations, the government pressed for public tenders.
The tenants were against it, and they also wanted more long-term contractual terms.
In 2009 we rented for companies in Circular Quay, which brought Obeid's $2.5 million a year, to participate without the need to participate in public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who served as port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a beneficiary of public competition.
He denied, however, that the changes were made to Mr. Obeid's request, which, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, he insisted on a motion in the government's rental policy.
The transfer of calls submitted in the ICAO showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Mr Tripodim and Mr Steve Dunn, who came to the port resort after working under Mr Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
"Was the purpose of the talks during these phone calls the development of commercial rental policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheely, Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but it's definitely not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft attacked a target in Syria, the responsible actor said
Israeli military aircraft hit the target on Thursday night at the Syrian port of Lázikija, confirmed the responsible administrative director of the Fox News station.
This responsible actor did not say exactly what purpose it was for, but said that he was at least one.
The Press Agency Associated Press states that the objective was the rockets of the Russian production of SA-125.
At least twice a year ago, Israel launched an air raid on the Syrian missile shipments.
A lot of things moved, and it's different.
Perhaps the commenter Pečinka spoke in such a way that he could agree with what the President of the Czech Republic was insinuating.
Heitman Chowanec was suspicious of me as soon as he was elected president, and he confirmed it.
The president of Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of the ČSSD moment still.
The other gentlemen led their weaknesses mainly.
Senator Dienstbier is both basic and user-friendly, Vice-President Zaoralek has been unable to talk on television as much as possible.
On the basis of this, I do not see a better chance than ČSSD has proposed to the Vice-President of the Senate of Gajdöšk, the only one who would not have an initial handle and I think it would take the standard performance.
It's such a good solution that someone in charge will hardly support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and to continue without breaking the party.
Alena Gajdöškova could without concern make up a minority government with only the blessing of the President Babi and without people, but with the human health minister of Hovorko, who is actually a trusted social democrat.
This minimum government would have great stability because it would enforce the right referendum law and thus commit itself to supporting the President of the Ocamura Summit.
The president of Babish would finally be heading towards the progress of the tax, because he's smart and will see that it's not going without her.
People wouldn't be in trouble, because Talker is the bearer of the best they have, and they wouldn't be in the government otherwise.
The same applies to the UN, even here, would be a valuable minister, but if they do not want to participate in a risky government participation, they will provide support, too, well.
Let's just give the Gajdöšk the courage!
Foreign workers with visa authorisation may undergo a "authority" test
As the government intends to expand police progress, it considers the "authority" test for foreign workers with a visa permit 457.
The test, if adopted, will be applied through the criteria to prevent the 457 programme from being used to fill unqualified jobs, or as the last return for family and friends in Australia.
When a government discussion article was issued today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric on foreign workers saying that it could harm the Australian neighbours.
“The “vote declaration by “citizens at the end of the front” and “work first for Australians” are a very unpleasant remnant since the unions demanded a protected labour market,” said the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, it meant that the white labour force should be protected – and I would not wonder if anyone in this region had noticed the answer to this historic artifact.
The discussion article will take 12 measures previously considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday at Sri Lance, where he was one of the officials for feeding people, implemented five of the recommended changes and the others remain to be considered.
Where the ‘authority’ criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is valid for a situation where the applicant is in relation to or in relation to a personal relationship with the owner or the relevant person of the sponsor’.
After past experience with companies that planned to sponsor a small number of workers but then hired hundreds of them, businesses may also need to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka who tried to find asylum died with a suspicion of a heart attack after arriving on an asylum ship on the Christmas Island this week.
His nine - year - old scared son traveled to Australia with him and after his father died on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult brother who was also on board.
The Australian authorities with their husband rushed to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 indicates that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as the first phase begins in 2026.
Baroness Kramer said the project "joins Britain together".
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that cooperation with the British Government was "invented".
The first phase will consist of new high-speed rail lines between London and West Midlands.
After the phase two will lead a line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reassessed the estimated cost of building high-speed lines between London and northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which conducted talks with the national transport office Transport Scotland, entrusted HS2 to discover further railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel time for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three and less hours.
Baronka Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that better connects Britain and its cities."
We gave SH2 green because the benefit that it brings is huge.
Without that, we face a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
However, it is also about connecting – contrary to Britain, it will be better connected by HS2, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is for Scotland's good news."
Following the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to "consistently" support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed track has the potential to bring disproportionate economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds to the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across the UK."
We are therefore delighted to cooperate with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing the high-speed railway to Scotland and thus bringing all the benefits and complementing the line of Glasgow-Edinburgh, which the Scottish Government plans as well.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study with the British ministers during the next year and to the joint decision on further steps.
In conjunction with Bart's arrest of anti-corruption police inspectors and analysts
Information about the arrest of Vita Barty began to spread on Thursday night when the message was delivered by the server First.cz.
The MF DNES secrets found that the case had taken care of the General Security Councils (GIBS), her people had to arrest Bart in the centre of Prague.
It was played in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection shall address cases where there are accused policemen, but its powers shall also apply to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the anti-corruption police officers is arrested - leading analysts and informants Jan Petržílek.
He used to work for the Security Information Service in the past.
The spokesperson for the Anti-Corruption Police, Jaroslav Ibehe, refused to comment on the evidence that the media had to turn to GIBS in this matter.
Even her spokesman, Radka Sandor, did not want to say anything, she turned to the City State Department in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of hidden realities," said the spokeswoman Štěpánk Zenklova.
It can also be derived from this inconvenient reaction that the event has taken place, but it is in a concealment regime that does not allow the speaker to say anything specific.
Bart's lawyer, Oldrich Chudoba, is in a similar situation.
The media said that Bart is representing "and in this matter", but given that it is hidden information, Bart's arrest cannot be confirmed or dismissed.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest could be related to some police president Petrem Lessy.
This was carried out by Bart, together with former VV President Radke John, who was in charge of the interior ministry.
The dispute that led to a heated dispute between Mr. Petrem Nezem and Mr. VV had to even solve the then President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where this relationship got into my person.
No one contacted me, I wasn't interrogated.
"I really don't know anything," said IDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became the chief of police.
He was officially promoted by Radek John, the real leader of the party, but he was Bart at the time.
Now the boat was running for the election for the movement of the Eminent, the MP just ran away from him - by 175 votes.
The leader of the Academy Tomio Okamura said he didn't even know what was going on.
"The life of Bart was one of many candidates of many parties to our candidates and, as I have said repeatedly before the elections, he was not even a member of the Uzwicht direct democracy of Tommy Okamura," he distanced himself from Bart Okamura, who before the elections said that he had given Bart's space to run for Uzwit, because he helped him solve the problem of the executioners.
Vit Bárta settled in court in 2012 with his former partner with VV Jaroslav Škarko.
The rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers from Australian airlines will still have to shut down their tablets and smart phones during launch and landing, even without regard to US changes, in order to reduce the regulations on these devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given the US company space to change its procedures, so passengers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical phases of the flight if the devices remain in the "aircraft" mode.
Travelers can already do this during a major part of the year, but many people are concerned that they cannot have access to their electronic books during the launch and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not need to change their procedures in the short term.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that this notification was examined, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of the flight are still in force in Australia.
‘CASA currently has no specific provisions governing the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft,’ he said.
This question is covered by provisions that require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the period and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, who had already talked to CASA about extending her board entertainment wi-fi system, was subject to a change, but announced that the decision of the regulatory authority was subject to it.
"We would welcome if the CASA were to carry out an analysis of the authorisation to use electronic devices, because we really think that it would improve the experience of customers now that we have (the wireless navigation)," the speaker said.
Qantas has announced that it will continue to comply with the current rules.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change it soon," he said.
FAA requirements apply to US airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in the development in the regulatory area that can be useful for our passengers, and we are sure to carefully review the decision of the FAO and the reasons behind it.
In the case of U.S. air carriers, the impact of regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their airport park.
Operators will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, as well as review manuals, training materials, manual luggage programmes and information for passengers.
‘As long as the airline confirms its fleet tolerance, the passenger may allow the use of portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smart phones at any altitude of the sea,’ the FAA said.
In rare cases, the crew shall direct the passenger to turn off during the arrival of the equipment.
The group also recommended that the heavy equipment be safely stored under the seat or in the parking space above the head during take-off and take-off.
With the growing beid, the middle class enjoys the sunsets in Singapore
Janani Amirhalinga's gold bracelet, ring and earrings are stopped at the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore, so that she can pay her daughter for school.
"We just bought a house with our husband, and I put all my money on it," says Mrs. Amirhalinga.
Although every month as an administrator receives $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, the family monthly income is insufficient, says.
In fact, the demand against South-East Asian areas, where household debt is increasing, is that ValueMax, where a woman is carrying out her transaction, has become the third flag in Singapore this week.
The suspension of the sprays is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore, employees usually apply an annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above 15.4 per cent of the rate offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a side in the same shopping centre.
However, the contractors have the advantage that they do not require a person's verification (payment history) or income document and can provide a loan faster than the banks.
And that's why, as families feel pressure from rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to hostages.
After five years of potential growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by a relaxed monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and medium-income income are turning to stockpiles to deal with a worsening financial situation.
This week, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's quoted increased use of credit in households mainly because of increased rents as a risk factor for the credibility of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia because of the rough domestic product.
Malaysia is at the front of a scoreboard of 80 per cent of GDP, which is an increase of 60 per cent in 2008.
Economics were also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week only came from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing low export and a weakening of consumer demand.
"It is essential that, with rising costs, people will try to fill their income from the middle to the lower [receipt scales] wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at the CIMB Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to the fact that people eagerly suspend their personal property and take advantage of the opportunity to change for the cash of their family jewelry.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city capitals are made of gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
The largest stop operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, has recorded up to 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its stoppages in recent months.
Growth in the flagship sector is so large that ValueMax, the operator of branches in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also to Asia, says Executive Director ValueMax Yes Lee Chingová.
The company will finance it using 60 per cent of the 66 million SGD that it received this week at the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discontinuous believers have been exposed to criticism because of high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah says that the institution offers not only lower rates than other believers, but also does not directly raise the debt.
"The customers stop objects that they already own, and the financing of personal property does not raise the debt of the household," he says.
In the company, the foundation of the property is increasingly accepted as a means of ensuring short-term, secure financing.
Besides, there are not only people in financial distress.
The rich people from Singapore also use the ValueMax side when they stop gold flags or Rolex watches, and they can reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are from all possible dimensions.
"They are rich individuals who need short-term loans for their bold transactions or investments, or small businesses who need help to solve problems in their cash flow," says Mrs. Yeahová.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as they can.
Savings package worth $325 million for Tasmanian health care
The Federal Government is insisting that the savings package of $325 million for cosmetic health in Tasmania should contain hard conditions to ensure that the government does not waste funds.
The Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Australian Union is "a rapid measure" to reverse the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Four years of funding was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MP, Andrew Wilk.
"The government has come with a emergency rescue package, which, we believe, solves the specific problems facing it," Mrs Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgery at the patient's request.
Further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic operations and operations of the gray reserve, will help to remove debt.
Money is also available for free clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the ideas that leading clinical doctors have told me that they will best help the Tasmanian health system," said Mrs. Plibersek.
The Ministry stressed that the Government of Tasmania must require a strict system of reporting and record-keeping.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the Australian bond money and to inform monthly where additional funds have been made available.
A triangular committee will be set up to ensure that the State provides services as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million will be nothing unless he follows a genuine reform with a view to establishing a more sustainable basis for the Tasmanian public health system.
However, he commended the government for its response to his request for accelerated assistance, which he first brought in with the President of the Government in early May.
"I believe that the federal relief package can free public health from critical state," said Wilkie.
According to the State Government, these additional procedures chosen will significantly reverse the recent collapses.
Speaking federal opposition in the area of health, Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is only "suffering".
"The reason I'm here is that the Labour Government has taken $430 million out of our health system," said ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes almost half a billion dollars, and the Australian bond, that's $300 million, and pretends it's a good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be issued to a higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted the novel Denise Diderota, which brings exceptional film production and time creation, but is also more boring than it should be.
They go to France in the 60th century and tell a lucid story about Suzanne, a young nun who is sent to the monastery by her family.
When he wakes up, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from the brutally repulsive mother who is represented and becomes an object of sexual passion for others.
The film is never accumulating or accumulating, and that's his problem.
The radical root of this story leads to the fact that even the spectators will experience a torment similar to the wearing of the shirt.
Skiareás want to feed families with children
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production resources, says the Surveillance Authority
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and gas ammunition, said the Global Monitoring Committee on Chemical Weapons on Thursday, while severe conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where the substances are stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago.
The notification of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November,
the time limit set by this organisation, based in The Hague, to destroy or disable the operation of all equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons and mechanical equipment for the mixing of chemicals for the purpose of the production of toxic gas and the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this initial phase of destruction in principle is a significant milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy by half of 2014 all the chemical weapons of Damascus.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, the damašek must still begin the destruction of existing weapons and stocks.
This country is expected to have about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including hyperthyroidism and nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira, which experts speak of as a plant plant for the production of chemical weapons and storage, the Syrian observer for human rights with a seat in Britain, was launched on Thursday.
A group of activists, who, through the network of activists in Syria, monitored the total number of victims, announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
There should be 61 067 civilians, including 6 365 children.
On the government side, 29 954 members of Bashar Asada's armed forces, 18 678 military fighters and 187 armed men from Lebanon's Hezballah are to go.
There are also 2,202 government survivors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations organization estimated that 100,000 people died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Asad's units fought in Safira against rebels, many of which are connected with Al-Qaeda for weeks.
The observable on Thursday stated that the losses were on both sides, but had no specific numbers.
The fights posed a threat to which chemical weapons inspectors are facing, who are on their mission, when, in the midst of the ongoing civil war in Syria, they have to set up a chemical arsenal with strict deadlines.
The statement by the OPCW Office, which is closely cooperating with the United Nations, said that its team is now "satisfying that it has verified – and monitored the destruction – of Syrian-declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling".
He added that "there are currently no other control activities planned".
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said that because of my fear of security, they were unable to visit two places.
On Thursday, the OPCW authority stated that the two seats were ‘discharged and ... items of the chemical weapons programme which it contained were moved to two other declared seats that were checked’.
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira facility was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria approved a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I swear by the courage and determination that you have shown in fulfilling this most challenging mission, as this organisation once had," said Ahmet Uzumc, the director of the observers in his comment issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, they stand against themselves in civil war, primarily the Sunni Muslim rebels and Asad is ruling with his security forces, full of the Alawit sect, despite Shiite Islam.
With regard to further development, the Chief Observer Ramí Abdul Rahmán said on Wednesday there was a strong explosion inside the air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lázikija.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the judgment of the founder of the bomb attack in Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the bombing in Bali in 2002 responded to the judgment of the last of the founders who were put before justice and said that the Umar Patek had to be corrected.
The pact, which spent almost 10 years on escape as one of the most wanted in Southeast Asia, was last night sentenced to 20 years in prison for setting up an explosive device that was used in the bombing.
In 15 years, he could be released conditionally.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other charges related to terrorism, including a series of bombings against churches in Indonesia on the night of the year 2000.
The complaint claimed life, although it could be that a man with the name "Demolition man" (broker) was given the death penalty due to his reputation as an expert in the production of explosives.
This decision brought back to life the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother of Perth, who lost her 39 - year - old twins Jane and Jenny almost ten years ago in a devastating attack by Patek.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should go in the footsteps of the others.
For the AAP agency, Mrs Corteen said: "It should be set up in front of the repairer."
Every day, I have to live with the fact that I don't see other grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was compared to the country when on 12 October 2002 a strong drive was fired shortly after 23 o'clock, located outside the parked supplier.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide killer fired a bat loaded with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, three times the doctors “dead”.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should face the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jama Islamia responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlase and Imama Samudru – who were repaired four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, it's just not.
Get 20 years for 202 people killed and hundreds of others hurt, not so much.
Patek stood before the court as the last of the assassins in Bali.
The arrest was avoided for almost ten years, but finally it occurred in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbotttabad, where in the next four months the American forces later killed former leader Al-Qaeda Usám bin Ládin.
During the trial, an FBI agent in his testimony stated that reports from the intelligence services revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Ládine in an attempt to re-establish the connection between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't volunteer," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he did not feel sorry for how much grief he caused others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will include the ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"We'll see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
The patent may still appeal to the verdict.
FAA: Passengers in air transport can now use technological supplies in aircraft (but must not call from their mobile phones)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices "from door to door" – apart from calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of the expected new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
But passengers don't expect changes to happen immediately.
As soon as the change is introduced, according to individual airlines, the manager of the FAA Michael Huerta said at the press conference.
Air carriers will have to submit the FAA management as long as their aeroplanes comply with the new rules and that they have updated the training manuals for the crew and the installation directive in order to comply with the new rules.
The FAA has indicated that some airlines have already received plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
The companies they've already planned are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we can improve the expanded use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA stated in its statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They cannot be activated until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometres and the captain does not issue a permit.
Travelers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane falls to land, and they will not stop them until the aircraft is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and departure, the FAA has introduced.
From most of the new transport aircraft and other aircraft, which have been adjusted so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes, these criteria are expected to be met.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
"As soon as new rules are in place – and we will work closely with transport companies – it will be a success," Glading said in his statement.
It is already very encouraging to say that we look like “watchers. ”
However, surfing on the Internet, sending emails and texting or downloading data will still be prohibited below 3 kilometres of sea height, the agency said.
The passengers will be informed that their smart phones, tablets and other devices will be switched to flight mode.
So there are still no words with friends, online game of type scrabble, which actor Alec Baldwin played on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as well known, expelled from the American Airlines aircraft, because he refused to turn off his equipment when the plane was parked at the gate.
And harder devices like notebooks will still have to be stored because of the fear that they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile calls will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for using mobile phones do not determine FAA, but the American Federal Telecommunications Committee.
FAA may suspend the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month Mark Rosenker from the State Committee on Transport Safety, an expert on national security in transport at CBS News, said that mobile phones are still at risk.
"Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigational devices, but from FCC data we also know that they can cause disturbance of transmission towers in the air," Rosenker said.
The Advisory Committee established by the FAA to examine this problem proposed last month that the government should allow wider use of electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been developed on the FAA to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics, like Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, claim that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult because the use of such facilities is universal.
Some studies suggest that until a third of travellers forget to turn off their equipment or ignore it.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communication equipment when passengers started carrying FM radio, the technical exploitation of the time.
New airlines are much more dedicated to electrical systems than previous generations, but are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Air carriers have already been offering passenger use of Wi-Fi in passenger altitudes for several years.
Plans for Wi-Fi systems are also more robust in terms of handling.
A large majority of airlines should be adapted under the new rules for greater use of electronic equipment, said Huertová.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intensive radio broadcasting than they did in previous generations.
For example, e-readers only issue minimum broadcasts when turning the page.
But the transmission is stronger when the devices download or send data.
Among those who press for exemption to use these devices as passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the representatives of this company loaded the aircraft with their electronic readings Kindle and carried out the pilot years, but no problem arose.
The members of the FAO Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities were at risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Air Operators said he is convinced that the removal from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have stated that there are only austerity reports from pilots that are intended to support the fact that such facilities can cause a disruption of air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA pilots be allowed to order passengers to turn off equipment during flight according to low visibility devices.
The Group of the Travel Industry welcomed these changes and is in line with the reasonable procedure for the travelling public, which is using technology to a large extent.
"We are pleased that the FAA has recognised that the pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, Executive Director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was transported from the garden of the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported to the coast after being found exhausted on the oil surface in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One Christian was transferred by a helicopter last month to Aberdeen after being treated by the Scottish company SPCA in the rescue centre until he was treated.
Colin Seddon's operating center said: "This baptism probably migrated from northern Europe when it was captured by a strong wind over the North Sea."
According to him, the forces came and the shelter was found on the ground floor.
Mr. Seddon added: "He wasn't able to fly again, so we were contacted by a request for help."
At the time of the baptism he was released, he was in good condition and health.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign (British trade) was launched in April with a commitment to link businesses and define what changes they want to see in relation to the EU by British entrepreneurs and companies creating jobs.
To this end, we have launched the largest and most complex research in which we asked the leading British entrepreneurs about Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing British companies of different sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the research will be surprising.
We have found that the steady majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states are lagging behind.
They want to see how the government is prioritizing new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, before they stop in the long and urgent process of reforming the secret European institutions.
When we asked their views on specific policy areas – from monopolies to production laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
It was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels's regulation now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European trade area – the agreement has even expressed 40% of the large companies, which is traditionally the most pro-European companies.
Finally, our research of leading companies revealed the most arbitrary knowledge, although the clear majority wants Britain to seek a change in the Treaty and the relationship with the EU that should be based on trade, not politics.
From the finding that the companies of different sizes and the main groups of companies have been involved, it appears that the business sector is pushing for a "significant change", which will transfer the impact back to Britain.
There is a lot to be said – the achievement of the amendment to the Treaty and better agreements for Britain can mean a profit of up to 16 % when voting in the EU's collapse referendum.
The president of the government should not weigh: this survey shows that the British trade supports its plan to renew the conditions of British membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this innovation to mean a significant shift from the current weighting back to Britain.
The better agreement for Britain is possible and given the way in which the euro area is being delivered on its way to a more economic and fiscal union, even more urgent.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of our research show, this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
John Kerry admitted: The spying went too far!
The United States has occasionally been "too far away", according to the AFP agency chief of American diplomacy John Kerry during a video conference between Washington and London.
However, according to the Minister, the collection of information served to eliminate terrorist attacks.
According to the AFP, "The first recognition from Washington" was announced in the middle of a strong debate on the two coasts of the Atlantic for the scandalous discovery of the joint monitoring of the data by the American National Security Agency (NSA), whose mission was also made by American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just as the President (Barack Obama) did, some of these actions have gone too far and we make sure that it will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the conversation, however, the practice of today’s day was particularly banishable.
According to him, the collection of information is necessary for the fight against terrorism and the prevention of assassinations, such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, the assassinations in Madrid in March 2004 or in London in July 2005.
"We prevented airplanes from falling, buildings exploded, and people were killed because we were able to be informed in time of the charges," Kerry stressed.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went disproportionately far".
Aféra, around the U.S. intelligence that reportedly followed hundreds of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also tracking the mobile phone of the German office of Angely Merkel.
European leaders did not hide their frustration and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach agreements with the United States that would command or significantly limit monitoring.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom says the pipes in Bulgaria are starting a new gas era
The launch of the South Stream pipeline building in Bulgaria means the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, said Gazprom Director.
"Today we witness to the border: The construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is the key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The supply of South Stream should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are removed "forever".
As soon as the whole project starts its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from the South Stream pipeline at the desired price.
The Gazprom company says that the building has to start in other countries in the direction of the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2,2 billion cubic feet of ground gas.
Hezballah sent thousands of warriors to Syria.
It's waiting for a decisive battle.
The Lebanese movement of Hizballáh settled 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle on the mountainous region of Kalamún.
According to Israel’s continuing clarifying reports, in the middle of two hits in western Syria, Hezballah’s missiles were destroyed.
This Lebanese Shishak organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the dark army.
Its programme is also a fight against Israel, which is not involved in the Syrian conflict, but clearly said that it would prevent the movement of weapons to the hands of Hizballah to Lebanon.
The reports of Israeli mid-airships on weapons stockpiles in Western Syria are now being clarified.
Israel was not commenting, but it was confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean area by the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakia.
The al-Arab reporting station claims that there were two stocks in which rockets were prepared for transport to Lebanon.
According to her sources, it was the rockets of Russian production SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but military analyst Ron ben Jišaj said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hizballah with rockets and Syrian aircraft to teach members of the armed section of Hizballah to deal with rockets.
The SA-8 are obsolete rockets that have been in the Syrian army since the 1980s.
They're placed on the mobile transport.
Although relatively primitive, with mobility and small dimensions it is easy to hide them.
They're equipped with a radar, which will turn off after the fire, so it's hard to focus on.
Latakia lies in western Syria, in the area inhabited by the ruling alavites.
It is a well - guarded area and Hizballáh has been involved in battles in western Syria in the past.
They say it helps to protect the Syrian Shishak community, to which the Fascists belong.
Now, perhaps 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help get the army back to Kalamun.
Together with Hizballah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its troops there.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city in the country of Homs.
The battle is to be led by the source of al-Arabi for a recent attack on the Syrian Shiite Brigade Abu Fadla Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
This year, Hizballah helped the Syrian army fight back the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border.
Many rebels from Kusajra just went to Kalamun.
Recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic had chosen to vote in advance.
As a reason, corruption, money laundering for pre-purchased purchases and state orders, increased taxes and in the last series of government scandals were introduced.
According to the results of the elections, the majority of the citizens have achieved this status.
The fact that they did not really care about it and that the state that was here (the theft and debt of this state) was actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I would not explain that 3 413 497 voters did not reach the elections, 596 357 voters elected TOP 09 384 174 voters elected ODS in total thus 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52,16% of all right-wing voters.
Which is the upper half.
When 1 016 829 ČSSD votes are added to the above-mentioned parties, then the old order (because all of those parties were involved in the "disposal" and the debt of the State), then 64.23% of the eligible votes were agreed with this status.
In fact, most voters have indicated that they are not for the punishment of the perpetrators of the theft and abuse of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD who shared the principles of the relevant laws are involved?
Is there any help?

The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) had been accused of charges against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Commission for the Sexual Abuse of Children was informed that two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) in New South Wales had complained about the sexual abuse of children before charges against the child educator Jonathan Lord in Caringbah in 2011.
But before the Commission it was announced that in its opening statement to the Commission, this association stated that they had never dealt with the case of child sexual abuse in their organisation.
The Executive Director, Phillip Hare, was questioned when one of the employees of the YMCA Association was accused of child pornography offences, and the other when a nurse in Caringbah from the YMCA Association was convicted of sexual harassment of children in 1991.
Mr. Hare said to Gaili Furness, the committee's adviser, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the YMCA association's initial declaration was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out in YMCA, which assessed this organisation as a pre-retirement of children's rights.
The evidence submitted by the Commission points out that the YMCA has been informed that in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society since August this year, it received the second lowest of four possible assessments.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA Association when he was 21, admitted that the management of him himself had failed when Mr. Lord accepted, without ensuring that the staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of the rules of safety of children.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment by 12 boys who were allowed to work in the YMCA Association for two years.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, refused to claim that the YMCA association had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting a child security breach to Mr. Lord.
Members of staff gave evidence that they were witnesses of such violations, including that Lord was with the children on his own, in particular watching them, letting them sit down at their home, telling them that he liked them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was under the control of Lord and asked for the safety of the children, because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of the YMCA Children's Association in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was “very scary and often hard to talk to him about”.
The Director-General said he did not accept the evidence from staff that they felt that they were not aware of whether to contact their superiors and the effect of reporting.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord had obscured their judgment, and that is why they didn't solve the problem.
Mr. Hare said that the Council of the YMCA Association in New South Wales had announced his opinion that training from the "Jonathan Lord" event for the organisation was based on the fact that staff "did not send any message", and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to allow staff to sign agreements on the maintenance of silence shortly after the indictment was discovered made by the General Manager for Child Services in YMCA Liam Whitley.
He said that the aim was to avoid the violation of evidence, but it was "extensively bitter" and badly implemented.
An expert on child sexual abuse Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not in 2009 until 2011 an organization that would be safe for children.
He said there were serious problems in recruitment, checking, working, training and staff management.
The hearing was postponed on 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take a chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but he admitted that the return was unlikely.
During the night discussion on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the office, 59-year-old politician expressed his views on the various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, after ten years in the leading position, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussions on British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role in the broadcast of the Bisque Water Quartet.
When asked whether he would return to the post of minister, his answer to London's Evening Standard said, "Yes, of course, but it's probably hard to do that, so..."
While in Cardiff, the representatives of the horse-making experts gathered to fight for the price of the Year, it was clear that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although not yet in school and only a few months ago did he make the first legs, this boy and his animal pet, Shetland pony Toffee, the ice-creams went through three laps to finally win the main prize and leave behind 30 adult rivals.
These unsolved twins – with the same height – were run by the Sunnybank driver centre in Rudry village near Cardiff for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition.
He stood up against the ladies and ladies in elegant hats, put his bar into a happy corner and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around.
Fenton was praised by the jury for its natural ability to control horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee has been given his third birthday in March and since then with this Shetland ponie every day.
His mother Donna (30) said, "Fenton and Toffee are working well."
They didn't have much hope, but they finally left with a gold cup and a pencil.
It was just the second time he competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were excited.
Everyone considered him a phenomenal and totally foreign people wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales is walking in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who plays the horse for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howels says: "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was excited and excited."
He ran for sand all along the arena, and even though he did so little, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is an animal - he loves horses, tractors and a farm and gets two chickens in his care.
In view of how he started, he'll be back soon at the competition for the year's Horse and I'm sure he'll be doing well.
He said, "Fentons are only three, but he already knows how to control the pony."
It's a great team together.
The jury raised Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they were held in the competition district.
They always watch how good teamwork is between pony and who leads it – and Fenton and Toffe were on the best sheep.
I'm sure Fenton also helped with a nice dress, he really fell there with him.
Too many expert papers are to be examined
The Chinese newspapers, which on the title page requested the release of the defendant from the contract, will be thoroughly examined, the press administrator said.
News New Express, based in Guangzhou, made a rare public request to release journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr Chen later admitted on television that he had received fees to invent stories about the company partly owned by the State.
The manager said that the New Express newspaper will now be "full repair".
The order for the "paper" came from the State Administration for printing and publishing, advertising, film and television in the province of Kuang-tung.
The preliminary investigation showed that in the period from September 2012 to August 2013 News from the Yakcheng group Evening News issued several false reports about that company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express was unorganised," said the manager in his statement.
He said he had to decide "to place Chen Yongzhou's administrative penalty in the form of a cancellation of a press license".
Furthermore, "He ordered the Yakcheng group Evening News to complete the new express list and recommended that the responsible persons be examined in New Express and changed the new express list immediately".
Mr. Chen wrote for New Express a number of articles dealing with financial imbalances in the company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his papers issued two requests on the title page for his release and claimed to be behind his journalistic work.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had issued false stories for payment.
"In this case, I have caused the damage to Zoomlion and also to the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence," said the CCTV State Reporting Station.
I did it mainly because I was looking for money and glory.
I realize I acted badly.
After Mr. Chen's apology, he issued a New Express letter on the cover page of the apology in which he stated that he failed when he did not carry out enough control of his report.
In recent times, several closely followed suspects have been admitted on television.
Experts say that confessions are still out of place, regardless of the changes to the law this year, which prevents the authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
There was a tunnel for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most creative tunnels for drug feeding between the United States and Mexico was found, complemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel of dimensions about one times one meter as one of the most intelligent secrets they've ever discovered.
The tunnel, which clicks to the length of almost six football games, connects the warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of undecided warehouses, where it can easily hide freight vehicles before they are loaded with drugs.
The authorities indicated that the tunnel was closed before the drug could be transported undetected.
In addition, according to the Court’s findings, eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine were retained.
Three men, according to the authorities, who worked as a driver, were accused of holding marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the case of a sentence, the sentence shall be preceded by a sentence of 10 years after the death of a person.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, the shepherds explore vast drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana bottle in central Mexico, which before drug cartels poses a problem as quickly as possible to get your product to consumers.
In 2010 the authorities found a walk of about 650 metres equipped with colleges, which led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economics and the Centre are proposing management.
For example, offer a joint advertisement
A new integrated Economics Newsroom in Prague.
Economics has taken another step to transform the holding of the Centre into its media home.
Since Friday, Economy and the Centre have shared top management.
"The Union of Organizational Structures and Personal Unions are essential for the integration of both publishers into the common media house," comments Vice-President of Economics and Managing Director-General Kamil Kermák.
The Kermak, who will stand in front of a single management, will be complemented by the Executive Director of the Centre Holdings Andreas Demoth.
The new joint director of the trade was appointed Pavel Voparíl, who was also appointed by the director of the auction of Zuzana Tilčerová.
The new chief of information technology became Štópán Burda.
The joint editor is Vladimir Piskáček, whose team is also the director for the transformation of Jakub Unger.
The newly established office of marketing director was entrusted to Adela Pitts.
The independent service of corporate communication is newly controlling the faith of Lhotská.
The Joint Financial Director is Karel Žalud, managing human resources for both of Peter's publications.
"The new organisational structure will, among other things, allow us to come to the market with a joint offer of advertising products, better link the production of the content of all issued titles and, last but not least, further significantly improve the company's business management," Kermák added.
The company, which is owned by Zdeněk Bakal, has concluded a contract for the purchase of the Centre Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings creates servers Currently.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Našto or portfolio of other wireless two dozen smaller websites.
The company is the publisher of the economic news, the IHNED.cz news server, the weekly Respect and Economics and the number of printed and internet B2B titles.
The Czech publishers have the longest success in selling digital versions of their main titles.
This year, in June, publishing moved to newly built modern spaces in Prague.
CME targets television business.
It's going to release almost a quarter of the people.
The media group CME will be released.
By the end of the year, he's trying to steal thousands of people.
He's planning all the side-by-side activities and he wants to focus only on his main business, television broadcast.
A group that owns Nova TV in Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia employs a total of about 4,500 people.
That's how nearly a quarter of the people come to work.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smileov, Telka and Czech version of MTV.
How much savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the German TV unit TV Nova, it is not clear yet.
"This is premature and we can't really comment," said the Director of Communication Novy Josef Koukolíček.
According to the information provided by MF DNES, the significant release of the Czech Republic is certainly not to be avoided, but it should have the greatest impact on the personal status of the CME branch in Romania and other countries.
Both new heads of the New Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who have been acting as long-term director of Adrian Sarbu, spoke during a mid-term conference with analysts about wanting to limit all activities that do not directly relate to television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly limit the costs of production of its own series, film and production activities.
In the industrial area ČKD in Prague hot in the night of the cold tower
In the industrial area of ČKD in Prague, a large-capacitated tank was burned, according to the fires, probably the cooling tower.
"The fire had already been fired on Thursday before eleven o'clock in the morning, and the fire had been extinguished this morning," Pavlín Adamc, a spokesman of the Prague Firers, announced.
The amount of pollutants in the ambient air as measured did not exceed the permitted limits.
The damage and causes of the fire are still unknown.
There were about five dozen firemen in the area in Kolben Street.
"It's about the fire of a large-capacitated container, probably a cooling tower," Adamc said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we're going to shut down using the transport management from the tanker," she added.
According to the server, Mr.cz has complicated the failure of the network of hydrants, which is why the firemen had to transport water to the pipeline.
The fireman announced the second level of firefight.
There are four degrees, in the most serious situations the fourth is declared.
They also went to the place of chemicals to verify the peace of dangerous substances that could be reached by fire in the air.
"But they did not measure the amount of pollutants in the air that would exceed the hygiene standards," the speakers of the firemen said.
British police have handed Assange a notice of release
The British police today delivered a notice of the release of Founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found shelter at the equatorial embassy in London, where he requested asylum.
Scotland Yard announced that he had given Australia a 40-year-old release notice by asking him to be delivered to the police station and that if he did not do so, he might be in danger of being arrested.
Assange, under British law, has exhausted his options when the Supreme Court this month cancelled his appeal against extradition, thus facing extradition to Sweden for charges of sexual crimes.
Because he feared that Stockholm would release him to the United States, he searched for a shelter on the 19th of June at the equatorial embassy in London, where this South American country asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard "has provided a notice on the issue of a 40-year-old man who asks to be delivered to the police station on the day and hour that he was assigned," the speaker said.
Assange still violates the conditions of the bail.
The authorities refused to comment on the notification of the issue.
Assange is afraid of being issued from Sweden to the United States, where he can face accusations from the espionage, because on WikiLeaks' website, he published 250,000 US diplomatic documents.
The driver got 1,000 pounds for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist got 1,000 pounds for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree town in Essex was seen on 27 May in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, she found out she had a cup of tea between her thighs.
At the Colchester Police Court, Howie confessed to the charge that he was driving unwarranted and unwarranted.
Its account reached seven points, resulting in a six-month ban.
Howiem was also ordered to pay the costs of 90 pounds and the cost of 100 pounds.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble breaks down
The Ministry of Finance has calculated the tax on the profit of the financial assets in advance, but it is waiting for Mr Osborn's final decision, which in the 2012 budget, represented a 7 % transfer fee for buildings at a price of over 2 million pounds and annual charges for buyers who own property within the company, not as individuals.
The contribution from the real estate transfer fee in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea periods, which in the tax year 2012/13 reached 708 million pounds, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-West, North-West and Yorkshire and Humber together.
Mr Cook said: “Because of the increase in the transfer of property in high-value houses and the presentation of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that the property of high-value property is slightly taxed regardless of the effect of the ageing tax system on the head.”
He added that “this step could have caused some foreign investors to lose their properties in London, if the current owners lose their ability to sell”.
The previous real estate – up to 5 % to 10 % of the housing market at the price – in the rich band, which belongs to Fulham after Wimbledon, recorded an increase of 11,8 % in record last year.
The prices in mid- London continue to show an annual growth of 5,6 %, but have been marked by a booming domestic market, where, according to a survey by the real estate office of Savillas, Southwest, North (7,4 %) and East (6,5 %) increased.
Scientists have explained more about the movements of the oesophagus associated with the mood of the dog
Previous research has shown that the joyful dogs turn over more traffic (from the dog’s point of view), while the nervous dogs have mostly left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can detect and react to these fine differences in the motion of the eye.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: “People are well aware that the left and right side of the brain have a different link to initiatives that provoke positive or negative emotions.”
The same thing we were trying to avoid in other species.
He added that, as is the case with humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-wing movements and on the contrary, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to obtain further information on how dogs react to the disproportionate twisting of the tail of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched films about other dogs.
They measured the incidence of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Probably won't take long before we understand why their tail goes on one side and on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have rejected the dog films – either in a natural version or in the form of a silhouette – to get rid of any maturing moves, and we have also been able to adjust the movement of the tail and to paint it more right or left."
When the animal saw that the dog was moving in a direction of transport (from the dog’s turn), it remained completely calm.
However, when she recorded the occassation mostly left (again from the dog’s turn), their fever rate increased and the animals acted differently.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs would communicate with each other knowingly through these movements.
Rather, it is believed that the dogs have learned from experience what movements they must and must not pay attention to.
He said: "If you meet dogs and move their tails in one direction, it is repeatedly linked to friendly behavior and movement of transport produces less friendly behavior, you will react on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say that finding can help dogs, veterinarians and practitioners to better understand the emotions of their animals.
A dog behavior specialist John Bradshaw, a college professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said it wasn't the first study that examined whether the left and right side of the dog is important.
Last year, Lincoln University team found out that dogs turn their heads left when they see an aggressive dog, and the right when they look at a happy dog.
And in another expert interview from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “The dogs with the robot were more likely to get acquainted with when he turned his back on the left than when they were becoming strangers – on the contrary, contrary to Italian studies.”
According to him, the difference may be caused by the fact that dogs in these various animal studies in films or dog robots did not perform completely as dogs.
He explained that she could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
“Even though in the case of many different sparrows, there is low evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details are still to be explained – and dogs are not an exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won't take long before we understand why their tail goes on one side and on the other.
Arctic Monkeys for Alexe Turner's disease moved a concert to Glasgow
The Rock Group Arctic Monkeys launched a concert in Glasgow after the main singer was diagnosed with a grit.
The Sheffield group was supposed to go out on Friday in the city complex of Hydro.
The power of the lead singer Alex Turner made her move.
The group's announcement came after a further postponement of the fourth LG arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys group says: “After deciding to postpone today’s LG Arena in Birmingham and on the basis of a medical recommendation, the Arctic Monkeys group must also postpone its presentation in the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday November.”
"Alexi Turner was diagnosed with hrtana and unfortunately will not be able to emerge."
The exhibition in the LG arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20th and the exhibition in the Hydro complex in Glasgow on November 21.
All the tickets for this exhibition remain valid.
We would like to apologize to all those who bought their tickets for the inconveniences that made them.

Pope Francis names the first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope František was the first to name new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22nd.
Cardinals in the clergy of the Catholic Church have the highest position right after the Pope and are those who choose the Pope, so František sets up his first group of men who will finally help choose his successor.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
As soon as the cardinal reaches the age of 80, however, the election of the pope is no longer possible – the group is thus reduced to 120 elective cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican speaker, said that a meeting of current Cardinals known as Consistorium would be held before the celebration of the new Cardinals.
“The Pope decided to announce his decision to allow the February Consistency to facilitate the planning of other meetings, which require the participation of cardinals from various parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices list said the number of electing cardinals is likely to fall into the February.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it is necessary to increase the number of voters again to 120, and as many cardinals as he wants to be 80 years old.
Consistorium will be important next year because it will be the first after František was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At this point, there are some orientations on Europe and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope appoints cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of the Roman Catholics are in South America, but they only have an improper number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since František established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, which has been tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided everything for himself.
"Now František has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "very possible", that these cardinals asked for advice.
But we haven't been in this situation before – it's just news.
Valero said that the popes traditionally increased the position of the cardinals of the bishop from large places, but František is "full of surprise – so we don't know who he is.
GM is charging some new light trucks in the United States for repairing the seat-belts
According to a Friday announcement from the US automotive safety authority General Motors, nearly 19,000 new (2014) light-duty cars Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra are being loaded to repair the problem with manual loading.
Some of these vehicles may have a mechanism of attaching front seats to the system.
As a result, the seat-belts are not in accordance with federal car safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the State Road Safety Management (NHTSA) website says that “if the vehicle gets hit, the head restraint does not have to protect passengers correctly, which increases the risk of interest”.
The models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The GM introduced a supply to the market in June and for this front American car it is the most important introduction to the market since post-banking in 2009.
The company GM informed the supplier of the factory in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the owners' announcements due to the 16-day government failure, which weakened the car sales growth in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were processed for the 2014 models, increased over the first 10 months of this year by about 20 per cent, the GM announced on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models.
The shares at the New York Stock Exchange grew by 1.4 per cent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
Zaufalý krykrek Obam's voters
I chose both times – I shared the hope of a possible change
He says Obama's honest efforts have eliminated the Republican side's obstruction
Obstructive policy cannot excuse the passions of Obama’s websites for health care or attacks of unmanned aircraft
Obama's 2008 campaign memories are a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying medicine at Harvard the second year.
In these days, I read a book that is so sad.
I thought about this book that during the cloudy days of my second year at the medical school, it would encourage and restore a sense of hope in me.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and is a reminder of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finish my patient budget tonight and go to bed, the book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and shows you breathing.
The elections ended with a drive and television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My associates cried out with joy, and my parents hid the papers they found.
In the White House, a young team of visionaries and the nation were ready to change.
During the submission to the Office in 2008, Obama had 82 per cent of its support.
And here I close the book.
Going to the present is a harsh awakening, like talking out of a dream.
It is hard to recall these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of the missed opportunities.
In the years after I entered my first election card, there really was a change.
It was definitely nothing of what I imagined.
I recognise that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the law on affordable care through the withdrawal of our armies from Iraq and the end of the policy "not to ask anything, not to say anything" after the death of Usám bin Ladina.
I am also convinced that the side-blocks have returned so much effort to move our nation forward: among other things it is immigration reform, the public's choice of health care and the closure of the basics in Guatemala.
But after many situations, when I defended Obama's administration from colleagues and friends, I grew up to an absolute limit as to the explanation they could provide.
I felt political despair in the place.
The obstruction of Republicans cannot explain the agreement with the hearing of foreign leaders or with flights of unmanned aircraft that kill innocent children in the sea.
They cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, nor that it pursues those who reveal the wrong conduct of the government.
They cannot be held responsible for the correction of Anwar al-Awlakí, an American citizen, without proper court or for limiting public contributions and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify finding a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are "more unaggressive ... than Nixon's administration".
And more recently, they cannot even apologize for the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the law on the availability of easy website care.
I don't know if anything like that could happen.
I should have known in 18 years that government power could be in conflict with the political campaigns that had preceded it.
The volunteer function obviously has no predictable duration, and our public talks will create an opposition political party and random events, such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I mentioned above appear to be to a large extent the result of the administrative decision.
And that hurts the most.
I chose both again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unscrupulous alternative, and it seemed that he could not rely on his policy or position.
I felt that the second functional period for Obama, released from the pressure of the next elections, would fill the hopes that we had ever heard of.
However, the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support this week down 45% – is more difficult through this book.
It makes me remember the number of promises they've lost.
This week, I read in the book the chapter about how Obama, in the capitals of Pennsylvania, suffered a severe defeat with Clinton.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to the pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively the opinions of Nathaniel Morrise.
Clive Palmer claims that the president of the government Tony Abbott is in the interest of the parental leave program
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer say that the president of the government, Tony Abbott, is very interested in the parental leave program, because his daughters can get pregnant and care for it.
The Banyan magnet, which runs a dispute over the replacement of a 6 million-dollar carbon tax measure, brought out this claim when he tried to get rid of the table of the question whether it was in the middle of interest.
Palmer's United Party may hold up to four votes in the Senate, which play a key role in deciding whether to collect taxes from coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that there could be only ministers in the middle of interest, and he added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could have a personal benefit from the policies.
"He got into a great deal of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughter was pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would receive parental leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the elections, the electoral commission officially declared Mr Palmer to be the winner of the Fairfax chair in the Sunshine Coast area due to the profit of 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Dcery Tonyo Abbotta Frances to Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closing of the elections?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come, tap the details into the computer, vote immediately and have results in the middle of the seventh night?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of thugs to label voting cards.
Is it that the results can be faded if someone doesn't like it?
In these days and at this time, the use of wheat seems unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer (59) said that his political programme also applied to the airport in Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new job “very seriously”.
The public office is a public service.
"We do not strive for any reward except that we can serve companies at this critical time," he said.
You wash your hands?
The scientists have found that they're washing your hands with the sun and the sun.
The experiment involved 98 people divided into three groups.
The first two were to solve the unresolved role.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after the accident was much more optimistic than the one where her participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the group "with washed hands" in another test led better than the other one.
Nevertheless, those who washed their hands were affected by the worse results in other tests than those who had not washed them.
The results of the "dead" were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not record any previous failure.
The results of the test show, according to psychologists, that body purity removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, the motivation is reduced, the tests must focus much more on other tests.
If we were to transfer the results to the Czech Republic, we'd probably be the most optimistic when we returned from the toilet.
After using the WC, however, the hands do not have only one percent of Czechs and Czechs, but on the way to the city transport it is now five.
In hygiene, it is also used by the majority after working in the garden or in a room where 85 percent of the people wash their hands.
Watching the home pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent study revealed that there is a difference in the perception of the Czechs and the Slovaks, as much as it is necessary to wash hands after handing them to a stranger.
In this situation, the hands can wash 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be in place, I am afraid that reality is different and people are trying to make themselves a little better," commented skin doctor Claudia Komárková.
RBS suspends two traders with foreign currency
According to two persons known to be in the situation, the Scottish Royal Bank (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another sign that the global investigation by the control authorities of suspected money-market machines is increasingly frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with the competent authorities in investigating the world's largest financial market where each day the owners change USD 5.3 billion.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the context of an extensive investigation, which would respond to the scandal with the manipulating rate of LIBOR (London interbank interest rate).
The Bank refused to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received an information request from the authorities this month.
"Our intrusive search for this thing continues and we fully cooperate with the FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people who are close to this event stated that RBS sent to the British financial institution e-mails and quick reports sent from the accounts and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and is expected to be released from his current position as European President of Trade with foreign currency at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European Money Trading President in Cita, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, the former currency manager in Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
Neither of these traders was charged with any offence.
In the group of Mr. Usher to send quick reports, bankers from Barclays and Citigroup said that they were dedicated to this event.
The UBS said this week that after the Swiss control authority Finma announced that he was investigating suspected foreign-money machinery in several Swiss banks, he took action against some of his employees.
At least six offices worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antitrust Office, Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the USA and the Monetary Office in Hong Kong – are examining the claim that these banks have collaborated to move with the monetary market.
People aware of the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also left an internal investigation or received an application for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are scrutinizing the years with old fast reports and e-mails to find cases of violations.
The investigation reports frightened traders in the area, which was one of the largest engines for creating profit in the closures of investment banks in the past years, but which was disrupted by the fact that a small drop in currency limited the opportunity for speculators.
Some bankers tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation when they claimed that with a large and highly liquid foreign currency market it was essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders said it was not necessarily true.
The highly established trader said that despite the significant volume of daily trading with foreign currency liquidity exploration between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms, "you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."
The report came on Thursday when Credit Suisse announced that this week she missed out of her department for trading with the shares of the trader, who lost almost USD 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank shall immediately notify the competent authorities and cooperate with their supervisory authorities.
"We are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this problem was solved," Credit Suisse said.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded a thousand
Doctors in Prague have reported more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the survey in 1986 to the end of the third quarter of the test, the infection was confirmed by a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
It comes from the national reference laboratory statistics for the AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to it, 2,063 were infected throughout the Czech Republic.
In 396 Immune failure patients, it's already gone.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic has increased annually in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed infections in 50 people, five years later they were 121.
In 2009, the investigation revealed 156 new infections and then 180 in 2010.
The number proposed fell to 153 years ago, but it was rather recordable.
According to the lab, they were 212.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, I believe there is no doubt," says the expert on AIDS Miroslav Hlavatý, who has been leading the Prague Light House for patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, the tests revealed a disease in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavaty introduced.
In September, doctors reported 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September HIV tests were confirmed by 1710 men and 353 women.
A lack of AIDS has been reported in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Whoever really wants to know a city should go to the graves.
His visit reveals more than a walk through the center with memories, churches and galleries than he would have imagined.
A lot of people read from the graves.
They slowly push their graves and gain intimate insight into local reality.
They find that people living here live what nations, what faiths, how large and coherent families they belong to, how old they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, their taste.
And from the condition of the graves, they'll find out how they're looking after their dead remains.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Care Act
The Supreme Court in the United States has decided that the health care law signed by Barack Obama is in accordance with the constitution, which is the primary victory for Obama's administration.
In terms of vote 5:4 the Court decided that the individual regulation of the Law on the Protection of Patients and Available Care – which orders citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or threatens them to pay fines – does not support the Constitution on the basis of government tax powers.
The President of the Court John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining parts of the Law on 2700 pages and further decided that the legal requirement for health care, which orders States to extend the possibility of obtaining non-indebted insurance, would, otherwise, threaten the absence of any financing of non-indebted insurance from federal resources, be non-indebted and contrary to the Constitution.
The complaint for blocking this law has been filed by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
During the spring of 2012, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
For the word "Mugabe is a bullet hole" is no longer a threat to prison, the court has violated the law
So far, Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to the public talk about the 90 - year - old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, since the end of 1987.
According to paragraph 33 of the Criminal Law, for the sake of the President's contempt, a fine of $100 was a threat to one year's freedom.
"State representatives should not strongly accuse people who are commenting on the president in the homes or in other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court declared.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government has appealed against the decision of the court, the British BBC has informed.
Against the law, a number of injured Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, who were arrested by the police two years ago by the President's alleged attack on the police force in the bar.
In May, he ended up in prison with an opposition activist who attended Mugabe's public service with a "cuckoo donkey".
In August, the prosecutor charged a man for his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as a toilet paper.
The Court also declared an anti-constitutional law restricting the freedom of the media.
"The state cannot punish people whose declaration will later appear to be false," said the Deputy Minister of Justice Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe’s law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment.
"The existence of a law allowing someone to be criminalized for a false declaration has a freezing effect on the right to speak freely," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, in March Zimbabwe has adopted a new constitution on the basis of a referendum with broader civil freedoms.
A small step from the dictatorship of one man's country took place in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition led to the Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangiraje.
However, the country continues to face the economic crisis, and by 2008 the world's highest inflation has exceeded 100,000 per cent.
In 2009, the government therefore completely abolished the national currency.
Today, only the currencies of other countries are paid in Zimbabwe.
The above-mentioned economy is at the heart of Mugabe's unrelenting agricultural reform.
In 2000, he rediscovered the land of white farmers between his beneficiaries and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience in walking with the farm.
Central banks will keep their own lines steady
The temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fedem, the Bank of England and the Central Banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument to enable banks to access global currencies whenever they need it.
The banks put it in their joint statement.
"It is a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, chief international economist of the London Bank of Barclays.
"I'm taking all the transitional tools of this type gradually become permanent, so it's not according to my surprise," adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist of BH Securities.
The central bankers reinforce the gap that began to arise in 2007 when the international credit market first collapsed.
The Central Bank agreements allowed access to euro, dollar and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision by central bankers comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to complete its US economy support programme, which could avoid the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract shall be used by default to overcome the lack of liquidity of one currency at the current liquidity of the second currency.
It can be understood as an asset of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in the European Bank.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will monitor 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) has personal data.
More than a year ago, I made registration on Tipsport.cz pages.
But then I didn't finish here, because someone just sat on the sidewalk, someone who didn't have to finish the internet registration.
And because I didn't want to go to the other side, the registration went down, and then I moved, and that changed my address and the number of the public card.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that it didn't work because I had another OP number, an address, and that it just didn't work out, and that I was supposed to ask for a data deletion and a new registration.
So I did that, and on 24.10.2013 I wrote in technical support that I was asking for the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable personal data protection law.
The spirit of the day has written me technical support that I have the registration to end up on the sidewalk.
This started a marathon of e-mails for technical support, where finally after the 4th of August 25.10, they wrote that personal data on my request had been deleted.
So a person would say that he could do that new registration and here they started problems again first, wrote to me that my username is already contained (I don't understand it - it's not about personal data, but finally it was deleted too).
So I used a different user name and jumped on me that my personal data had already been stored to complete the registration on the side (how can they have stored something that claims to have been deleted?), so I contacted again with technical support.
On my question, how could I have been told that personal data really deleted 25.10. and that I would send an e-mail with that error.
I did that (about 15 hours yesterday) and they told me today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that that's why I didn't do it because I used the same name and date of birth.
I've been in touch with technical support for a week and I'm going to make sure it's not going to work.
And what if the truth is what it claims (if it is not) could not be registered with the corresponding name or date of birth if it is already registered.
By the way, in 13.22, I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used the thought e-mail and phone number and the wild worlds, and the page came to me that they sent me an e-mail to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if it cannot be registered on the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport weighs the registration on e-mail and phone number and data just didn't figure out how he claims.
So I once again told technical support that they're just lying (whether deliberately or not) because what they're writing is not true.
I've shown several screens that the registration problem was already before 31.10. So "false" registration doesn't have any effect on this.
Tipsport has written a strict sentence to me - I'm sorry, but because you're already registered again, we can't check your claims.
And the communication's over.
Respect repeats the same sentence that registrations weigh on the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the e-mail and actually did not.
So, if I cut it off, Tipsport is not only that he didn't erase the data as he claims, but he's still lying when he claims to be wrong.
The worse it is that you can easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like there's a customer's fault.
By the way, following the introduction of this issue on my personal blog, things got a little moving and e-mail came from Technical Support that the issue was passed to the check and will be informed (after a week of urgency and harassment and notice of the same mistake).
In the subway on the Bridge playing music
The transport company Hl. m. (DPP) Prague launched the music project in the metro.
The first vestibule, where during the operation of the meter is constantly playing reproduced instrumental music, is the Městek line A at the exit at Václavje Square.
Test operation will take six months.
Michal Horaček introduced his new two albums, a band and three singers
Texture Michal Horáček has brought not only his completely new two-CD Czech calendar, but above all in a series between us singer Lenka Nova, Františka Segrada and Ondru Rumla accompanied by excellent orchestra Matěje Benka.
After the opening intruder and the late musical studio, Michal Horaček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, himself came to the light in his hand and recalled the story of how they last played in Kolina and in the theater and in the entire city came out of electric current.
"Otherwise, in Kolina there were two types of karate that I came in contact with a lot," I recalled.
And so did President Zeman's cousin.
"Maybe we could make tours after Zakolane or Dubravce at Bratislava," he whispered about the families of other presidents.
Several times a night Horaček, who did not leave his sights and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical order.
The calendar also made Joseph Mánes, who gave her an eagle, about ice hockey, but once in a while, he didn't know anything about how to meet in those places and scandalous who didn't jump, it's not Czech.
It's also called a song from the Czech calendar, but we're not playing here today," he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang from this board for him a very good Sleep during the day, sang at night, and accompanied her to the guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, he played percussion, all three singers then accompanied the band in the composition of the piano, viloncello, guitar and contrabas.
All three vocalists sang together a little retreat to the heart site, which immediately opened the scene.
"I'm glad the song caught you, which didn't surprise me in the town of Kmoch," Michal Horaček responded.
After the memory of Petra Hapku, I was informed by Františk Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller, who was rewarded with a huge applause, Han Heger's recollection of the composition Father loved Lid Baar and with Horatsk's explanation of the communist ban and the replacement of the American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocába recalled the composition of Sebastian, then Segrado sang the beautiful composition of Prague by Jard Svobodou, a beautiful cousin and former Colinánka.
But it was already a conclusion, a glimpse in the stand and an addendum in the form of an optimistic store We live in a wonderful time.
One more addition was ready for the player, but the fans had no more.
Nearly immediately after the concert, the whole quarter sat behind the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horaček his books and even wrapped up from the legendary LP and took a picture with any interested parties.
Berdycha with Szópánka adds Rosal and Hájek
At the final Davis Cup against Serbia appointed a non-playing Czech tennis captain Jaroslav Váráči Tomáš Berdich, Radek Štěpanek, Lukaš Rosol, Jan Hajek.
The Czech representatives defend the trophies, but they go to play the competition in the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs have been in the finals for the last five years.
"We know we're going to the hot ground, it's gonna be wild, and we need to focus as always on our performances."
"Let's go there with the only goal - to get three points and sell it the best," said Štěpanek, the winner of the last-day finale with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
School for Obama, how to bomb Syria.
American team in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Gulf of Persia.
The Israelis have just described how Syria's bombing is supposed to look.
Without any unnecessary loss, threat, and millions of declarations, planes were sent, you hit the target and returned.
They would not allow themselves to be sidetracked by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the entire action and no longer give rise to it.
The exact opposite of the confused and big-ass, the actions of unsubstantiated Obama's Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying of the attack was what the Israelites bombed.
Don't let the media deceive you with their claims that it was bombed by "syrian base" or "syrian supplies for Hizbaláh".
Recently, I wrote here that while aid to US secular rebels in the country remains only on rhetorical level, Russia is happy to continue to supply weapons to Syria.
And just a fresh supply of Russian rockets released in the port of Latakia became the target of an Israeli raid.
It's a clear message.
And notice, Israel once again bombed Asa’s regime, not the rebellion, although according to popular internet theories it should be the opposite.
The U.S. government has appointed 2 members of space units, probably Delta forces.
It has not yet been understood that they have been marked during the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.
It is known that the hero's death of two former SEALs members who blew the CIA's premises in the city, I think it was the members of the CIA's secret team, which is made up of former soldiers.
For a long time, what SEALs did was speculated on the consulate or even elsewhere located in the CIA residence.
Now it's clearer.
Any information that the CIA in Libya has its official protected bullet nests (right on one such SEALs members died after a minute attack) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising are the information about those two unknown heroes.
They were part of the U.S. team in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the report of the attack in Benghazi they volunteered to intervene and, along with five private contractors, opened their way to the CIA area in Benghazi.
The board blames the fact that during that attack, the command was not officially and completely assaulted and that it was just weighing on what to do.
Commander of the team, so without orders, they'll probably release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that the country is acting not on a one-off basis, but on an ongoing US team, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
And since there has been no formal recognition of such a thing until recently, and it is now only a NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's good that the United States is trying half the time to torture terrorism in Libya.
Even if it would be much more helpful to solve the national situation.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict I want to write today is the coast of Iran.
It's not that long ago the media almost absorbed Iranian air force for the conquest of American drones.
Little is known, however, how American drones effectively protect themselves.
Of course, if it happens to reveal its drone in the air space, there's nothing to do with it.
However, if the Iranian drone is found in international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom persecuted an American drone in an international sea-surveillance area, when perhaps the first acute setting of the American super-warf F-22 Raptor in history.
He flew Phantom to check his weapon on optics without registering Phantom on the radar or just notice it, and then when he suddenly found out about it and called on an Iranian driver to return home, he listened unrepeatably.
It's no wonder that Phantom is a pilot of American production, but he remembers the war in Vietnam.
He can't compare himself to Raptor.
We want to show that Plzeň can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's such a little paradox.
While his team has not been able, particularly in recent years, the defender or guardian of Victoria Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that has led him back to the representation after year.
He also has a gunshot, a hero of activity, after the move on him in the Teplís, he had a pouch.
Victoria scored in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplí after the victory, but finally she took the only point from these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes his team is breaking up with Jablon.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe the Jablonec will defeat at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is preparing carefully for a hard fight with the Northmen who play the attack football.
It's all about playing with Jablonc, the coach is preparing us well, as we always play a lot of games from the video discussion of the game.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," the Czech fan's representative at the Doosan Arena Court.
The final fights didn't work out the way she wished, but the word of the crisis of Victoria's defender refuses.
So it goes in the football, sometimes you have a good form and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any way.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," my protector of the West.
Victoria's courage will once again rely on the support of fans.
"It's Friday night, and I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we'll give them a win," says Rajtoral.
Jana Pethová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really about a step, it's about a big jump, it's about a few years back, and it's about my childhood.
It's a reminder of what it was like to have no worries and just come from school and wash the utensils, evaporate and do tasks.
Even though these "compulsory," it was most of the theory, the desire of parents.
The practice was completely different - coming from school, putting the bag in the corner and running out.
Play with the other kids ball games, jump pancakes.
Then, at Helen's show, and her boy, she's wearing a rare dress for Grandma's birthday party.
And then after a few warnings wash it finally, evaporate, in the winter, put the wood into brick stones and the tasks to do until after planting under the lamp (or rely on the partner and instead of the tasks to write the favorite verse addressed to the school love).
In the morning, we ate the homemade strawberry (of real fruit, not the jams that are being sold now, whose contents were neither of the strawberries nor of the bread) and drank it with tea from the dried vegetables that we and Mom had so enjoyed collecting.
I also remember those magical evenings when there were gravely quiet in the room, when we had the sister recording songs from the radio on the tapes that sounded in the old tapes by the mother.
And then we played the tapes on the counter, and we still played the same song, our favorite, and we got a syphony to it.
Or we used to call through the table using the backrests that were connected to each other - and when we were already on the phone to hear better, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, then the maid was a circus + vodka.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live with it, so we missed nothing.
We didn't need any iPhones, iPad ba even mobiles and notebooks or brand clothes.
Clothing was inherited from generation to generation, and the best "freak" in the dress was a drumstick of domestic production with the help of SAVA.
From the electronics, we had enough of the satisfaction of the so-called Mother's cassette and, at the most, Walkman, which we shared with our sister, and which, by the way, we used just the same thing on the train on the school trip.
We've come to play more interestingly with Aunt Kloboučka Hop or Man, don't get angry, or how I've already set out to go "only" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, I'm sure his parents were watching him for a long time, but unfortunately he didn't play with us for a long time.
My younger sister put a bullet in him, or she was so beautiful that she put the tapes down, so she tried to see if the bullet was falling.
I'm sorry he fell asleep, but it was his last turn.
Well, and this incident has to do with today, you bastard, on a plate from dad still.
She says that when Lenka was young, she had a video crash and thought she was playing a recipe and didn't win, so she can't hurt him until today.
I remember how we all managed to communicate together, agree without a cell phone, computer.
Together with my sister, we had an appointment with Grandma's granddaughter when we met again next year at Grandma's, and that's how it was.
We met.
Now you promise someone you'll see each other in a year?
I also remember the winter when we and the whole village ran out, built snowfalls, rode on a snowy hill at the church on sand dunes.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the last day.
Of course, we listened to the sister in front of every evening the famous notorious saying, "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, it applies today, but you certainly don't have a bonded soap in a lemon net in the bathroom.
After dinner, when Dad in the garage "worked" at a beer with Jarda from the village, we lay down with Mom on the floor, rubbed our feet on a brick stone, opened the door and looked at the flames and listened to the crackling of wood that ran out of the stone.
We were close - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated together - we spoke - we did not write daily messages through different chats, SMS.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew more about ourselves.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I add these memories by looking at the album, where the black horns are carefully glued to black-white pictures.
And if I didn't know how long it was then, behind the picture is always a year of recording.
I can see that if we didn't have a lot of listening to the cuts, and we also had the pants on our cousin's two bigger numbers, nobody ever talked to us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back on that step forward - into reality.
By 2013, and I'll wait for what modern times will come up with for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of me now are for a young adult generation so at least "one hundred years after the monkeys" and I think they're coming to a lot of people that don't live this time either.
I'd love to!
Google, Samsung and Huawei companies charged for Nortel's patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents missing Nortel, filed a complaint on Thursday to violate the patent against mobile phone producers, including Google, the company that she has appealed for in the course of Nortel bankruptcy.
The consortium of Rockstar, which purchased Nordel's patents for USD 4.5 billion, has been in favour of the US District Court in Texas, Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of breaking seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps to link expressions sought on the Internet with the relevant advertising, they present a complaint, which is the core of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately arrested.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that work on the operating system of Google Android, which competes strongly with mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011 Google made a $900 million bid for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and finally offered up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the fight for patents, Google won $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility, which was partly motivated by a group of Motorola patents.
“In spite of the failure of the efforts to obtain patents that are the subject of the dispute, Google’s patents have broken down and continue to break down,” the complaint states.
Rockstar strives for an increased compensation for the damage caused by Google, because according to it, the patent is being violated by Google intentionally, as the claim claims.
Miloslav Ceypková: November smile
She came outside, four degrees from Celsia, which we're not used to yet.
At first, she smiled, the one who still gave up as a defense against the love of friendly surroundings.
This made her very uncomfortable because it was a mask that she decided not to give up on the public.
He was honest at home only the days when she was a grandmother and had her grandson Elinka or Adika around her.
And, of course, when her sons called her.
She remembered very well the lesson of endless courses of business skills.
Now they're really out of their way.
So she doesn't get her closest one.
Then he flew into the corner.
It's like a dress on a man's shirt.
November, no other month can do that miracle to smile really, like when they were on a trip with someone who hasn't been here for nearly three years.
Introducing Egypt to the Office of the First-elected President
Muhammad Mursí made an inaugural promise, but his triumphal day is difficult to reconcile with the political turmoil in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Mursí promised "new Egypt", when he was celebrated as the first freely elected president of this country, after Husji Mubarak, who had met 16 months earlier.
In his introduction to the Office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursí also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the monarchy was defeated about 60 years ago.
He made an oath before 18 judges dressed in black talars in a settlement built with a view to the Nile, which reminds the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better tomorrow, new Egypt and the second republic," Mursí said in a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"The people of Egypt today laid the foundation of a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said Mursí, a 16-year-old engineer who studied in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, fundamentalist groups, who had been after 84 years of their creation as an illegal organization for the fierce attacks of individual governments.
When Mursí arrived in a small group of cars shortly after 11 a.m., hundreds of soldiers and policemen were guarding the building.
Only a few set of supporters met before the building court to celebrate the President, and unlike the presidential event of Mubarak's period, transport was only briefly stopped so that the project column could normally move along the road connecting the city centre to the suburbs in the south.
The personal prestige of Mursí, hummingly named as the non-charismatic "reservative pneumatics" of the Muslim brotherhood, has grown rapidly since his victory and his Friday performance, which was intended to present him not only as a candidate of the Islamics, but also all those who want to bring to the end the rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursí, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie to judges in a wooden chamber where he made his oath.
Mursi later traveled to the University of Kahir, where he was to present an opening speech.
While he was watching, he received an official greeting from a military band that played a national hymna.
Next time, the military commander was General Hussain Tantavi.
His income was accompanied by a scandal “arms and people are one hand” from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Kahir was founded in 1908 as the center of secular education and later in the 1970s became the heritage of Islamic student movements.
Mursí made a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrír Square, a place where a revolution was born that ended the authoritarian government of Mubarak last year, and celebratedly promised to regain the presidential authority of his office by the military council, which took it away from the expelled leader.
But I agree with the composition of the official oath before the court, rather than before Parliament, as usual, he has submitted to the will of the army, which means that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech at Tahrír Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
In the ghettos there'll be police specialists, they're supposed to slow down the tension.
In the ghettos in the Czech Republic, police specialists should be involved in the future.
They'd spend half their time here.
They'd look into the order and solve the problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to the reduction of tension between people from poor places and people from the environment.
In his proposal for a reduction of security risks, the Ministry is counting inside.
According to him, improving the situation in the country would help mainly "fast social housing".
The document has been exchanged by the government.
According to the analysis, there were 300 poor homes and a quarter in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
She lived in them for 80,000 people, mostly Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on doses, children ended up in "special" schools.
It's a blue liquid.
According to the experts, the problem location between the hundred and a hundred came.
Relationships between their inhabitants and others are escalating.
In a few places there were anti-Roma marches.
The extremists were also joined by people from the surrounding areas.
There's a lot of security and order on the inside for the police in the ghetto areas.
The basic condition is that "the consistent application of equal access to the rule of law".
But it is impossible to achieve without a detailed knowledge of places and people.
The specialist would go on a walk in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half his service, and the rest would serve in his circuit.
He'd be looking into the trouble room.
He would also know locals, so he could better solve problems or offences.
"Thanks to their trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent the whole range of illegal acts," he said inside.
Specialists in the ghettos would get supplements, which is 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas is to be built from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million crowns).
Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, 85 percent of the funds.
The preparations began this year, and now a detailed proposal is being prepared.
The project is to be completed by 2016.
The authors were inspired by neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied to Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded sites is unevenly higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements," the authors reported.
How many specialists in the Czech Republic should be, it's not clear yet.
The answer is to give an analysis that determines where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money these members will be able to free the police once the project is completed each year.
According to the project's proposal, the first election of the police is to graduate the strike in Slovakia.
Each year, five tenths of the members of this training should be provided.
They're the most suitable candidates.
It should also be a special training for police officers who will act in the ghettos.
According to the authors, improving the situation would help mainly social housing.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
Three categories should appear inside.
The minimum standard would comply with the exact rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
The higher standard would have social apartments that would be comparable to normal housing.
The tenants would have to complete an integration plan that would include social workers.
They would have to keep the accommodation order, take care of their health, send children to school, requalified and actively look for work.
If they tried to join, they would go up to the higher standard of living.
In-house housing should function for at least 30 years until the next generation "in a pro-integrated environment".
The social housing model prepares resorts for local development and work.
They've got to put him down by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Ugliärský top - one of our youngest socks.
The coal mine is an ideal hill 3 km south-east of Bruntal.
Along with a number of others, the document of the sock activity in Low Jeseník is recent (from a geological point of view).
The last eruptions here were still at the beginning of the quarter.
In view of the greater distance, on the top of the Ullírje peak is the ideal white baroque church of Miss Marie Help, built in 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pot hat.
The host standing next to the church was not preserved.
Shortly after the church was completed, a row of four Julys was cut off, about 1 km long.
The crossroads on the hill is already the third version, the original one was established after 1916, the second one, which lasted only until 2004.
On the 15th stop are wooden plastics made by the local art hunter František Nedmelel.
He used various species of trees from the Low Jesúnik area.
Similarly, the origin of the mountain from the area of the present area is an interesting geological exhibition.
The name of the sponsor shall also be given on each stop.
The coal top is the rest of the young soup.
Although data from the radiometric measurements are slightly different, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
He is therefore younger than the Great Red (age 3.3 million years old) and older than Venus's sop (age 0.8 million years old).
The frog was born an explosion.
With it, she cast a significant amount of soup soup along with the pieces of the oven from the floor that were made of redishish color by burning.
At the end of this phase came out on the surface of the bottle - today it is a layer of porous cassette up to 13 meters strong.
The second eruption threw out red, red and red and places to black tufies.
Their level is strong up to 50 meters and its part is accessible in the wall of the hole.
In the tubs there are imaginary soup pumas up to 1 meter. And the second eruption was combined with an extract of the milk.
At the end of the operation, a glass came out of the oven, which today forms up to 50 m of a strong layer of pot.
The mushrooms where the application of the soup soup with the lyophilisate is controlled are the most common type of soup.
Because they're actually made up of species, they've got the name of the stratovulcan.
The original liver was gradually exposed to erosion.
He was threatened, however, until he weighed down the mountain in the hole on the south side.
The most intense effort went on here in the years 1953 - 1962.
The tufs were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better heat insulation properties.
The effort has been put under the pressure of experts and the public to stop and to keep this unique place.
The problem is, however, in the ferocity and little consistency of the mountains that quickly blow up, break down and dry down.
The break's pretty fast.
In order to make the situation even more complicated, it is warm, south-east oriented, ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The solution is problematic, but in time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are kept in a number of important locations.
You will be reached on the Ullirsk peak by a green tourist brand from Bruntál, possibly from Slezské Kočov.
Car drivers can use an unpaid parking lot at the beginning of the Lip Alley, where a short scientific path begins.
She moved out of the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in the factory villa with a garden and pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villas in Orechovce.
The original owners of the house, however, received it back in return and the tenants had to move away with a small distance.
That's why Ivana was looking for a replacement home for herself and her older mom then.
From well-known people got a tip on apartment 3 + kk in the older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"It was a shock at first, but the look from the fourth floor to the vast forest park and the fence to the other side inspired me," recalls Ivana at the first impression.
At first, I thought it would be a three-year commission.
"Today we live here for more than thirteen years, and not just because of the gradual reconstruction, I would not change," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter then moved from a hundred and twenty-metre apartment to a smaller area of 62 m2 and almost all the equipment was distributed.
The action was not simple, things were compatible with friends and the gradual arrangement lasted almost a year.
The new apartment was in a good condition, but had to make the necessary adjustments, such as door painting or window replacement.
The previous owner had removed the kernel, but the owner was the one who did most of the unpracticely solved and the rest of the large chair, and on the contrary the small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional residential space.
Architects have been used to measure individual zones and to join the Sadrokarton room, which has enabled new light placements.
The first move she decided to make after a few years was the removal of the bull in the living room.
The apartment has changed its availability to 2 + kk, but the room has gained air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
Another step towards the partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of the PVC floor for laminate.
Ivana didn't know about the bathroom.
For years, I had taken the magazines to live and sought inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
So, for the recommendation, I spoke to young architect Camila Doudér.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," said Ivan.
Thanks to the refurbishment of the bathroom, it has also been possible to adjust the furniture available at the same time.
The architect linked the toilet and bathroom space and two doors with the opening wings replaced with one moving, saving the place.
The bathroom is overtime and also quite barrier.
The quality bags imitate the pistachio, there is also a comfortable seat in the shower, a bidet shower in the bathroom.
Successful cooperation with Kamil Douder continued.
As part of the series, the dream took place quickly, but the main change in the living room was also shared by the architect Martin Čeněk.
To the space created by the combination of two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without helping ourselves with the classic principles of optical division, such as semi-trailers or Japanese walls.
"This would result in a breach of the openness and unity of space," explains the architect.
It was able to originally separate the sleeping and living part.
It was enough to turn the back of two beds, and between them to make a box of feathers in peace.
The food corner clears the walls of the floor and paints.
On the floor in the kitchen and in the dining area, the architect used quality marbleum, the moving door revived with a wallpaper.
The kitchen corner shall, where necessary, cover removable panels with wallpaper.
The new floor of antiallergic marble has opposite fronts of laminate a number of advantages: a soft, non-slip surface without spasms and better sound insulation.
The color-extended sadrocardon system shows how the panel can work with space.
I left the paints on the architects, I wish it was happy.
"I love Orange, I had the same percentage in my previous apartment," Ivana says.
The wall of the graphs with the motive of flowering magnolia is practical and creates a remarkable aesthetic element.
To the warm energy tone, architects chose a white, which supported the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, books were placed, among other things, into space under no parapets.
Everything is in progress, the lamps are comfortably controlled away.
In the transformed interior, the contrast of a new one works perfectly with older ones, for example, for decades with the old Christian mirror and with the quality of art that Ivana collects all her life.
The last one came to the kitchen.
The boxes were first placed on both sides, and the owner looked a little like a tunnel.
The architect took their number and changed the location.
The apartment in a simple design is made on the order, the white area softens the perennial surface slightly.
They went into a small space thanks to the ideal solution of the washing machine, the dryer and the mouse.
The view of the small kitchen restored a glassed wall cover over the work desk.
The unique chart with a digitally printed motif is attractive and is also well maintained.
Ivana chose the flowers of magnolia that remind her of the favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now it seems she's happy here.
In the original bathroom there was a small van and a washroom, and the new owner chose a neutral percentage of the envelope.
The big shower corner has a glass door to the Ronal.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from the environment in which functions and facilities will be in harmony.
The interior is made of material and colourful, and we have tried for its elegant, cozy, not too crowded view.
"The next condition of the task was a barrierless solution with a minimum obstacle and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the availability of items of daily needs," Kamila Doudérová adds.
The Supreme Court has ruled: Sometimes it can be argued.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Peter Infrequently could be sued for any criminal acts that he could have committed before the August resolution of the Post Office.
It was protected only by procedural immunity, which relates to demonstrations in Snow.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksy, Mark Šnajdra and Petra Tluchoře, on the contrary, he decided that he could not be punished for any criminal acts until last November, said speaker of the Supreme Court, Petr Knötig.
By this decision, the Court rejected the proposal of the State representative Iva Eštvana, who wanted to continue in criminal proceedings with the MPs.
According to him, they accepted a payment in the form of luxury jobs in state companies for giving up their mandate and not having to do any problems with the adoption of laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered these posts could continue to be beaten.
Deputy Anti-Corruption Police Officer also held with Vít Bartou
Bart's guardian Oldrich Chudoba, who also represented her in the case of alleged corruption of the VV MPs, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said, "Yes, I represent the client in this case, but in view of the hidden facts, I cannot continue to comment."
According to information, the case is resolved by the General Safety Committees (GIBS).
The server said that Bart could buy hidden information from the police.
According to the lead server.cz, the case could have been related to the cause of former police president Petra Lessy, whose appointment to the function of Bart was allegedly attempted.
The latest information, however, shows that the detention of Vita Barty with Peter Lessy does not apply.
The spokesperson for the police president Eva Kropáčová refused to comment on the case being held by the Prague city council.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of hidden realities," said Mr. Štěpánk Zenklová, spokesperson of the State Department in Prague on Friday.
Bart's right-wing plaintiff is watching the thing, and its words are not directly implying that the record or criminal proceedings are conducted in a concealment regime.
The reporter was able to catch up with the wife of Vita Barty Katerín Klasno in the morning before their home in Prague.
She just loaded the suitcases into the car and left.
She refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, the leader of the movement, Tomio Okamura, expressed his arrest.
According to his words, he doesn't even know what's going on in the case.
"The Life of Bart was one of the many candidates of many parties to our candidate, and as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not even a member of the spirit of the direct democracy of Tommy Okamura," he added.
Vit Bart, who in previous early elections to Snowlovna in the Plzeńska country failed to successfully run for the move to destroy the direct democracy of Tommy Okamura, is known for his corrupt cause of the payment of the Members of the Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was wrongly sentenced to 18 months with a 30-month delay.
Later, the verdict was changed and Bart was acquitted.
I want a contract in NHL.
I still have the guts, the desire and the enthusiasm.
For Prospala, she was always at the top of her family, so she wanted to be fully subordinated in her 38 years.
He's either getting a job in the sea and he's still going on his career, or he's definitely going to end up with a hockey.
"I want to fulfill my father's and my husband's roles."
"I'm looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still looking forward to the offer.
Even though he's a certified worker who never gets any help.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice, he can also beat the players.
And despite the fact that he was the most productive player of Columbus in the past season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still in me," they say decisively.
Maybe she's a girl, apparently it's about New York Rangers, who didn't get into the season, and they've got two injured attacks -- attackers Rick Nashe and Ryan Callahan.
How does it look with your arrival at Rangers?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have anything on the paper, it's not worth it.
I know an article in the New York Post journal came out that they should sign me, but that's all.
It's never been added, it's really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
They didn't even call you from the club?
Such communication in NHL takes place on a daily basis.
That's where it's going to get to the situation when the deal really comes.
When you need to hurt a player or it's not going to happen to anyone and the manchaff doesn't run.
There's a lot of different factors that have to meet together to get me this contract.
But similar circumstances occur in New York, right?
He's hurt Rick Nash with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't get into the season, so there's a certain chance there is, don't you think?
Of course, that's always the chance.
The second thing is, you always need two sides to do that.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't got one yet.
I'm sorry about the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, expecting something to just blow up?
I have that expectation since July 5th, when the NHL opened the market with free players, and still nothing.
You're going to New York to remember?
No, of course not. I'm going to Tampy for the kids and for the wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
That's because I'm a father and a husband, and that's what it's all about.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a deal and I don't play games.
So I'm going to fulfill my father's and my husband's role, and I'm looking forward to it.
You have two hockey matches on Sunday, it's for me and my whole family Christmas when we can go and support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in the import tickets for full consideration?
Of course, a person can think of a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago, when I missed 50 games for knee surgery.
Too much and too much fun.
Once it gets to such a stage that all the balls, the winnings and the recordings won't make you what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Have the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing anyone could ever see me except my family.
Have you had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play NHL just because it's NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockey player, I'm in the first place - except for the family - it's also a sports success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is all about.
My children, so sorry, our children - mine and my women - grew up in the States, started going to school and so on.
And we would be very pleased if they continued in this trend.
Because what we're going to say is that in America there's a whole lot of possibilities somewhere else.
We should offer them such a chance.
So you're planning on staying in America for a while?
We'll practice it as we do.
This means that we will be in the Czech Republic in the Deep and around the Czech Budjejovic.
And again in the winter in Tampea or where our steps will lead us.
It's perfectly perfect, to be still warm.
I've had great luck in my life.
It's been said that I went contrary to him, it became a lot of strength and rejection, and it took me a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
That we and our wife can choose where we're going to live.
There are a lot of people in the world who want to be able to choose what they're going to do and how they're going to live.
How long in your life will you be willing to play, hard to train and wait for an offer?
Yeah, so that's the question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the desire, the enthusiasm, the passion for this sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have on the NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna stay there.
That's not supposed to happen.
So it can be said that you're waiting for this season to come out, and then you'll decide what's next?
I'm at the stage when I'm going from day to day.
The Director-General of ČEZ recently announced that the decision on the construction of the 3th and 4th block of the Temelín power plant will be postponed at the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State energy concept and by agreeing to the Contracts of Differences of Government.
This is why CEZ's current management is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, to the majority shareholder.
A qualified manager should, however, make recommendations to the shareholders and not hide behind him.
Grandma: I only rule with Sobotko.
Andrej Babish is beginning to feel that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political puzzle in opposition and that it will have to go straight to the government to create something at all.
The president of the United Nations admitted this in a discussion on the Law that will come out tomorrow.

Its competence includes the area of product and marketing and the strengthening of cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Ludzka Shantora in his office.
For the last 14 years, Abraham has joined his career in the car sector.
He worked in Toyota Motor Czech, then in Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the seven years of the Alfa Romeo brand and dealership.

ScoFIN was born in 1992.
Police evacuated because of the shooting at Los Angeles airport.
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
That's why the police evacuated part of the airport, it was supposed to be a terminal three.
The Reuters Agency with a call to the California media claims that men of law have shot a gun of armed men.
The Los Angeles Times, referring to the police, stated that there had been a gunshot wound between two and three members of the Safety Administration in transport.
How many people have been completely injured and whether there are any victims, but it's still not obvious.
The Hasichs are talking about events with a larger number of wounded.
CNN: Israel bombed the military base in Syria.
The goal was to be Russian missiles for Hizballáh.
Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
With the resignation of the so-called U.S. government, CNN television announced this.
The Israeli print on the explosion in the reported warehouse reported widely, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
The Israeli army spoke on the CNN question refused to comment on the incident.
"We are not talking about foreign media reports," she said.
According to the U.S. government resource, Israel's aircraft was equipped with rockets and related equipment, which the Israelis believed could be transported to the Lebanese militant movement of Hizballáh.
The AP, with the withdrawal to another US security factor, reported that Russian rockets SA-125 were the target of an Israeli raid on the Syrian territory.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the purpose of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defence system.
Satellite images of the attack area, but according to the DPA agencies showed the battery of the Russian rocket type S-125 Neva.
In addition, they were seen on the battery rocket SA-3 including the commander's radar station to track the rockets and their targets.
According to the Israeli TV report, recorded rockets are 35 kilometres away and could carry a weight of 70 kilograms.
Israel has already reportedly bombed rocket supplies inside Syria for at least twice this year, CNN and AP have introduced.
The Israeli army has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly declared that it will interfere with any supply of weapons to Hizballah or other terrorist groups.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to resist this trend successfully.
The company has updated the annual profit estimate and expects record profits from recreationals in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects its annual basic profit before taxing to move between USD 325 million and USD 340 million compared to USD 305 million to USD 315 million from the previous forecast.
If the current development is maintained, it will represent a 12-to-seven-percent increase in the record profit of $290.4 million from 2011/12.
Director-General Graham Turner said that Flight Centre created eight per cent profit in the first half and the second half began to grow rapidly mainly in Australian and British travels outside the service journey.
"Today, our 10 countries are profit-making, and several focus on record annual profit before growth and tax," he said.
This is Australia and the United Kingdom, which are traditionally our biggest profit-makers.
Business with recreational activities rose during the second half of Australia, which offsets the slightly weaker domestic market with business travel.
Similarly, in the United Kingdom, Flight Centre was well run in the recreational area, while the customers lost less.
America's trade is lost during the seasonally weaker half-years and is expected to bring a third in a series of annual profits.
Flight Centre's stock was 3 cents higher than yesterday at $38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia moved to Petrohrad
Environmental activists detained in Russia from September due to a protest against the planned oil demand in the Arctic were transferred from Murmansk to Petrohrad.
She informed the AFP about this today with a call to the Greenpeace International Environmental Organisation.
At the same time, she claims that the original accusations of her anti-piracy activists have not yet been made.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women detained in Russia after a violent action against the Arctic oil field were transferred from a repair facility in Murmansk to a prison in Petrohrad," the organization announced in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA agency, the move was planned.
Ecological authorities first accused them of piracy, which threatened them for up to 15 years in prison in the case of a sentence.
Last week, however, it was announced that this charge would be replaced by a smaller extremism, which threatens the lower penalty with the upper limit of seven years of deprivation of liberty.
However, in today's statement, Greenpeace noted that the government's piracy charges have not yet been met, as promised.
That means that detention is now charged with two criminal acts.
The Strong Investigation Committee announced last week that the charge of piracy is a substitute for the charges of extermination.
However, when thirty prisoners were imprisoned before the committee this week, the charge of piracy was not met.
Instead, a new accusation was made against everyone," the AFP quoted Greenpeace as saying.
The Russians held three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries in the Gazprom oil field in mid-September.
Ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise ship, swimming under the Dutch flag.
Since then, all of them have been held in custody against whom they have appealed, but the court has rejected them all.
Under the conditions of imprisonment, environmentalists complain.
The Executive Director Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo, according to the AFP, today stated that the move to Petrohrad would facilitate meetings held with families and consular workers.
However, there is no guarantee that conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"They can actually be worse," he warned.
She asked for help from Dutch King Willema-Alexandra one of Faiza Oulasen's detained activists.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch called on him to discuss their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It claims that Mali has a large share of the reconstruction of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is part of the part of the wars also in neighbouring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In the hours of English literature, at least one Shakespeare’s game, a 19th - century novel, romantic poetry, and the modern British beauty of 1914 will need to be studied further.
The test will also include ‘secret text’, to motivate them to read more deeply;
The combined courses of English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a language graduation exam and will be invited to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue new basics for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
In other key subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Office of Offqual, which oversees the graduation exams, reveals changes in the structure of the graduation exams, along with a new marking system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in summer, the Minister of Education Michael Gove said that he has “a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our test system to regain the trust of the company”, and that it is necessary to insist that the graduation test be “better, more ambitious and more stringent”.
The study shows that English schools spend less time in mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison of the school in Australia, mathematics spends an average of 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on mathematics, the coalition sources have stated that a comprehensive math exam – together with a greater emphasis on this subject in the result sheets – will probably encourage schools to provide further education.
The curriculum will focus more on "the problems of the real world", including financial mathematics.
Eastern Prime Minister Kanar: Rakovinou in ČSSD is not me
Before the elections, the long-standing dispute between the two wings fighting for the influence within the island ČSSD was completely heated.
It all turned out that the Prime Minister of Ostrava Petr Kainar turned to court for the non-democratic composition of the candidates.
However, the accused parties did not want to say too much so as not to cause further damage to the party before the elections.
Now, however, the votes of the electorate are being read out.
The management of the island of ČSSD so immediately on Monday evening invited the Prime Minister of Ostrava to step out of the way, and he will probably press on to find out his function.
But Peter Kainar wants to keep fighting.
What's going on in the fights and who's on the side of it, he described in an exclusive conversation for Danik.
How do you feel about the outcome of the election?
ČSSD must have calculated with a much better result.
Did it hurt her in front of the elections in the media inside the party?
I'm going to make it clear that social democracy could have a better election outcome.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the ČSSD is now.
It's a party that has its own internal problems, it's internally sick, and people think it's all right.
They made it clear in the elections.
What are those internal ČSSD diseases?
In my opinion, the ODS has been going through for a while, and similar things are now unfortunately being played in social democracy.
It's like lobbyists, they influence people who once expected to find their ancestors at the ODS, they moved to people in the ČSSD, and they have an influence on them.
It then relates to the fact that police and computer-collection officers are walking through the island magistrate's offices.
It shows that ČSSD is not only composed of people who want the good of all others, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
ČSSD is divided into two insurmountable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle of power between Haskovci and Sobotkovci.
And it's been getting ready for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was only a prelude to what is now taking place in Prague.
The Haškov wing gradually occupied its position so that, after the elections, it could trigger a situation that weakens the Sobotk wing.
A person is in politics in a situation when he has to get involved in compromises.
Everyone's got an internal border when the compromises don't work anymore, and that's my case.
Originally, I didn't want to run into the studio, but when I noticed the whole thing inside, I agreed with Luboš Zaoralak that I would try to get to the country candidate to send as prime minister of Ostrava to the Sobotk's wing.
Hashko's wing, but it gave up.
Why are you standing on the side of God's Slav Sobotka, not Michal Haška?
The Slavic of Sobotka is, in my opinion, a person who always talks primarily about the ČSSD programme and to a certain extent and about visas for the party and this country.
I admit, on the other hand, I didn't hear anything like that.
Michal Hasek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower authority than the Central Executive Committee, can begin to refer only to the Chairman of the Party.
It's a fight for power regardless of everything and against the states.
According to me, what Michael Hasek has now done in Prague has ended his political career.
How did you notice that the ČSSD's island management did not approve of your candidate?
The political parties are based on competition, which is put in place as their members.
This competition should be based largely on program visions and on the ability of those people to fill those visions.
Of course, there are people who do not have the ability or the vision, but the political party is a boost to money that is not available elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people start getting ahead because they break the rules without a scratch, they break the party's statements.
They do the mafia's political practices, and according to me they violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To highlight this problem is more important to me than to take into consideration whether any Kainar has a political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect their views.
Therefore, have you submitted a proposal before the elections to the court for preliminary measures against the form of the ČSSD candidate in the Moravskoslez region?
The current ČSSD Executive Committee in Ostrava is convinced by the fact that organisations that fail to comply with it can cancel, aim to set up a new organisation, gradually dismiss the disagreeable members of the party.
For example, they also wanted to exclude Richard Bednaræk from the representative's club, but he filed a complaint against it and then they canceled the resolution on his expulsion.
This indicates that compliance with the parties' opinions through the courts is the last option, but at a time when the other ways and control authorities within the ČSSD ceased to function, it is the only option.
The power of the ČSSD in front of the envoy Adam Rykalou is to withdraw you from the position of prime minister.
It's a public secret that this post has been held by the mayor of Poruby Lumír Palyz.
That's right, Adam Rykal and Lumir Palyza are trying to do everything they can to get me off the phone.
They promise people positions, they get voices, and then they get their power on the side.
When I went back to the past, all I had to do was play around the Baník Ostrava football club and buy a baseball stadium, it was just a trap for them to be able to attack me.
It was artificially designed to make me a person who gives money where it doesn't belong.
At the time, the city bought a property that has a strategically high value for it.
How, then, do you see this further with your suspension in the office of prime minister?
The Committee of the Regions has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our departures in the ČSSD.
But I think it's like a thief screaming, "Get the thieves!"
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I will not see anyone in the island's social democracy who would initiate and promote, sometimes even against the members of the party, the creation of as many developmental things as industrial zones or the expansion of the scientific and technological park.
Still, I'm getting uncomfortable.
I don't read it except that I'm preventing the others from going to the places they're looking for.
Are you going to be trying to fight these things?
Because if this republic is to function well, it must also work well with the political parties.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively control the state if they can't control themselves.
So I don't think I'd leave the ČSSD now, because I think the person who causes cancer on this side is not me, but those people who try to scare me.
Breakout opens in the historic center of public locker
The organizer of the Olympic Christmas markets and the winter breezes, Paul Sálény, stated that the preparatory work at the workshop was launched on 26 October and has been in operation since mid-June as an aggregate for ice production.
The ice level is already strong seven centimeters and the area will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The site has 375 square meters, the podium has taken 358 square meters.
The Brusselsians will also have two hamlets with a punch.
"We expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the stands, and almost the whole area of the podium was shaken so that the brusslers could easily rename themselves," said Burny.
The streets of the Olomouc are already reminding of the coming Christmas.
Last year, the key to the repair of the Lower Square was installed right before the main entrance of the workshop at the Upper Square.
The construction of the Lower Square was completed in the spring, so the ice area could return to its original location.
At first, people were able to destroy themselves right before the workshop in 2009, when it was the key in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the city’s Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, part of which is a rich cultural programme, will be launched in the Upper Square a month before Easter Day.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zlínska will be dealt with again by the national court
The national court dismissed the complaints of a 50-year-old Slovak and a 20-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men refused the blame.
They are threatened by 15 to 20 years of imprisonment or exceptional punishment.
Speaking Petr Angayalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court had annulled the decision of the country and that the matter had returned to him for discussion.
He refused to comment on the reasons for the decision that the parties had not yet been given.
According to the complaint, the young man was beaten by a man in his home for seven and a half years.
The senior died of a life-threatening death.
According to the complaint, her men were scratching, digging all over the body, and also with a metal object, apparently a gas gun, put about three dozen wounds in his head.
A man suffered a serious injury, such as a fracture of the skull bone, an island of the brain, or a bleeding in the brain that he suffered at the site.
The young people reportedly carried 3,000 crowns and jewels worth some 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the national court, they were the only, in addition, only indirect evidence against the alleged footing, which the expert assessed as not fully found within the meaning of the legal guidelines.
In more than ten cases, the scene of the crime was in agreement with the defendants, but the police initially imposed on them as a matter of course and not a dog's feet.
In addition, there was a certain misgiving when loading them.
According to the Senate, no guilt was proved without doubt.
However, the court admitted that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head found relatives who thought he had fallen and hurt himself.
She did not notice the violent death of her beloved doctor.
For several days, criminals contacted the lynching doctors who showed signs of violent death while drinking.
The police could no longer work with all the feet of the crime scene that relatives cleared.
There was no DNA on the scene of the defendants.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskogradička.
He is now sentenced to 8.5 years in prison, which he was confirmed by a court of law last year.
According to him, a group of six young men were organized, who were aware of a horrific drop in gold.
The Loupes became in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of the senior in Slopné.
Younger of the accused of the murder of a senior resident in the Uher Garden.
In August, he was released from prison for 11 months.
The snow begins with the reconstruction stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Snow.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by construction workers who would rebuild the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojm is divided into four stages so as to reflect the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week Sublime line
Saxophone's great and legend of Wayne Shorter's jazz scene will take place next Wednesday in the 18th anniversary of Struna's sub winter festival.
Shorter will be released on 6 November in the Grand Hall of Lucerny, together with his quartet in the composition of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, a spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the leadership of Martin Kumžák is added to Shorter.
In shorter adjustments for the symphonic orchestra, Pegasus composition from the novel album Without A Net, as well as his older composition Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated the eighteenth birthday this year in August, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert on the Strunas in the afternoon is starting his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the music world over 60 years ago.
The number of interpreters with whom he collaborated dates from Miles Davis through Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell, to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he met with Czech musician Miroslav Vitoš and Viennese cousin Joe Zawinul, who in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade gave direction to a new style of fusion.
He's been dating Wayne Shorter Quartet for the last 30 years.
As an afterparty after the festival will still be the night of the Spotlight club, which will take place on 9 November in the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrey Triany, the German audience is represented by the Manchester Trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz influenced by electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who introduces Profound Bass's electro-jazz formation inspired by dance styles.
The tax authorities prohibit UEFA from publishing penalties for the judge.
Dagmar Damková, Chairman of the Committee of Decision-makers of the Czech Football Association, ceased to publish sentences for the courts.
It is prohibited by UEFA rules, as set out in the Legal Journal of the Conference.
Otherwise, the FAČR would threaten the situation.
The lady also refused to sell her role to the Plzno footballers, where she came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in the Plenary, but the other committees are disillusioned, for example, from Prague.
So in the case of voting, I can lose 1:6,” said Damkova in a response to the criticism that broke after Plzeň last played twice as much penalty as the other league teams.
So even though FAČR has stopped publishing sentences for the judge in recent months, Damková ensures that the judges are wrong.
"Believe me, if the committee finds out that the decision maker has made a mistake, the delegation will limit it to any hit," Damkova said.
The reason why the penalties are not published is, according to the European Football Union ban.
"UEFA prohibits the publication of such information and is severely punished."
"We have a lot of suspicion and we're looking for something at every mistake."
"We have published the restriction, but I have received two very important warnings that if we do not stop, they will come a hard sentence," said Damko.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If the information continues to be published, the Commission could raise funds from UEFA for the education and development of decision makers.
"And you are very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to complete the decision-makers' programme," Damková added.
The custody of Bart is related to John and Behem: Are they behind the departure of the apostles?
The police were arrested on Thursday by the President of Vita Bart.
He was also detained by Jan Petržíek's head of the anti-corruption police analysis and information committee.
The detention is linked to the sending of the lobbyist Roman Januska and former Prime Minister Paul Bema (ODS).
Information about the envoys with whom the server came from Newsky.cz confirmed the Czech press office's confidential source.
The response to the telephone calls Janouška and Béma, who last March published the Young Front Journal today, and in which both men address each other "Mazánka" and "Kolibrík", show the influence of Janouškkov on the city's steps under the leadership of Beem.
The Journal then stated that in 2007 the Security Information Service (BIS) was ordered, from which two years later they fled to the ABL Security Agency.
That's where Bart owned it.
The Newinky.cz server pointed out that the detained criminal Petržíek was working ahead of his approach to the anti-corruption police just for the BIS.
To the anti-corruption agency that subsequently dealt with the mission, Petržílek moved on at the same time as they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of hidden information, I can't confirm anything or say anything at all," complainant Michal Muravský of the City State Department in Prague said.
He also refused to confirm that the cause was being monitored.
The case does not want to comment on the same reason even the inspection.
The new civil law is being prepared by six companies from ten
The coming effectiveness of the new Civilian Law and the Business Corporation Law as of 1 January 2014 is being intensively prepared by six companies from the 10th.
Only eight percent of the company's questionnaires indicated that the issues associated with both key codes in their company had not been resolved at all.
It comes from an investigation by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which has found out the views of 108 Czech companies.
In relation to the near term of effectiveness of both key codes, the last moment a number of managers are beginning to know how they can have a significant impact on their company’s business.
The biggest changes in private law over the last 50 years, in our view, will affect all citizens and businesses in the Czech Republic.
For the sake of policy-making, the business sector has lived for a long time in uncertainty whether or not revolutionary changes will finally come.
"Now, however, they have only a few weeks left to move on to new rights for their companies without any complications," commented Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spáčil.
Of 61 per cent of companies with intensive new lawmakers, 26 per cent indicated that their companies had already taken all necessary measures to be prepared in time.
In addition, 35 per cent of companies are planning to take the necessary measures as soon as possible.
Each fifth firm has not yet been involved in the recalibration, yet it has a concrete idea of how to prepare for it.
A total of 11 per cent has no opinion and cannot assess the problem.
Only eight percent of the companies admit that the issues associated with the recalibration have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal issue related to the new civil law is the most number of companies in question to conclude new contracts (21 per cent), followed by the settlement of trading conditions (16 per cent) and further changes in the property disaster and in liability for damage (up to 10 per cent).
The contract is one of the most important news of the whole rehabilitate, which is the merger of the amendment of the contract only within the framework of a new civil law.
The current parallel adjustment in the civil and commercial law will disappear, resulting in a more transparent contractual law for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new adjustment will offer a lot of news with emphasis on greater freedom of relations," lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukaš Poddání said.
In the context of the Commercial Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the most relevant topic to be the issue of increasing the responsibility of statutory authorities.
The following are the topics related to changes in the call and the duration of the event (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14 per cent).
The new legislative reform means strengthening the obligations and possible impacts for statutory authorities, in particular in the event of a collapse or a fall in the company.
"In practice this means that if members of the representations and directors of the company do not deal with the care of the proper economy and do not reverse the dangerous decline of the company, they can benefit from the performance of the function until the last two years," Spačil added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to develop Cartier's style as a living language

Travels through the bay, the river and the jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat almost every weekend hundreds of patients
In West Africa, there are not too many doctors; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or through your cell phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates at the CNN Hrdina Prize in 2013.
In the competition for the price CNN Hrdina in 2013, you can vote for it or for any of the ten main candidates.
The winner will get $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
All 21 years old Georges Bwelle watched his father go back and forth into unconsciousness and go to a hospital that was not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 near the main city of Cameroon Yaounde in a car accident.
First he was treated only with a broken hand, but then he developed an infection that spread into his brain, and there he developed a hematoma that affected him all his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to a crowded clinic and hospitals where he received such treatment as was just available.
"It's not easy," says Bwell.
You can leave home at five in the morning, hurry to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients there.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwelle's father died, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon for 5,000 people.
For comparison only, the situation in the United States is one doctor for 413 inhabitants.
And even if the Cameroonians could visit, many could not afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of the health care expenditure in this country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle says.
They can't enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team did 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself as a worm surgeon at the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded a non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose weekend members visit rural areas where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have been helped by their volunteer group.
Nearly every Friday he and 30 people rush into delivery, lean on the medical needs roofs and travel to villages that need help.
They're not always accompanied by happiness.
Suddenly, the vehicles must be pushed through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be greeted as real heroes: host, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is indeed a reason to celebrate and Bwelle, with its broad smile and unscrupulous energy, is very willing to engage in local joy.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on every expedition," says Bwelle.
They're coming to the village about 60 kilometers, and they're walking.
During each of these weeks, doctors provide various medical help.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, subjugation, diabetes, parasitic diseases, and generally transmitted diseases.
Others can get glasses or gifted glasses or a free birth certificate – a document that requires school, but which many poor families simply cannot afford.
Tonight, the team is doing a simple operation under local narcosis.
Operations are usually carried out at the building school, at the workshop or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to a nursing home to free another patient.
With light from the generator, the operating room and the hygienic equipment Bwelle and his volunteers are working in the early morning hours.
It's exhausting, but rural musicians usually help the team not to lose their motivation.
"To stay up and continue working, they play drums all night," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team will head back to town, tired, but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, carried out 700 free operations last year and is aware that their assistance can mean a lot to locals.
One man said he'd be able to work again after surgery.
"This will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around Yaounde.
It says that this second job is financed by about 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest are covered by private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she actually sleeps,” says Katie O’Malley, who is studying medicine at the University of Drexel in Philadelphia for the second year and working as a volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to get money for the organization to make these campaigns.
For medical and medical students, such as O'Malley, who have come from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, this is a great practice that they would not get home.
"We thoroughly cleaned our hands and removed the blood clots or held his tools," says O'Malley.
It's like a medical student in the second year of America you'll never live.
Voluntary students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often arrive with donated medical needs.
As soon as he gets to Yaounde, he supplies food, transportation, and study to them, Bwelle.
"No doubt it's a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle's constant attack, it's not a burden.
Helping others to live happier, to fulfill the promise that he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to do this job," Bwelle says.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain – that's why I'm doing it.

Minister Holcát restored the function of the Chief Sister for the Czech Republic
The main sister for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of the health sisters, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
"I strongly recommend that these functions be clearly defined and formalised so that the nurses of their representative within the structure of the Office - representatives to whom they can always address when necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the sister, and I think the care sector deserves to be given due attention from the Ministry.
In carrying out this call, not only is there a high level of professionalism, but there is also a human approach and personal conviction.
"I will gladly and with all my responsibilities try to promote the steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent sisters in our health care, but I would like to appeal to colleagues who do not help us with their approach to patients to perform their calls with all the empathy and help us in the public eye to improve the image of the sister," says Alena Schmidhová.
The newly appointed Chief Sister for ČR Alena Schmidhová, on the occasion of her appointment, also stated that she wanted to address the various aspects of the health care position and intended to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, teachers, other non-medical appointments and doctors.
"I don't really want to separate the appointment of doctors and sisters, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to me, each having its own competence and, together with other health professionals, being a trained working team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I am alone facing a number of problems that arise in the course of the sister's call, and I notice these inconsistencies and I intend to take part in their solutions."
They include, for example, the simplification of medical and health documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of the administrative tasks of the sisters are extraordinarily burdensome and waste time that they could and should devote to patients better," says Alena Schmidova.
The next area to be addressed is the improvement of working conditions, the search for a better cooperation between the team and the management of health services providers, the adjustment of competence and also the legal questions of employment, such as compliance with the labour law or the non-interference of their sister with their insufficient number at the given time and place.
We often hear anonymous rumors, which are not documented in a specific case, because of concern about the potential situation, where the rules could be violated.
"Where there is no plaintiff, there is no judge, and so the function of the head sister of the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of the preservation of anonymity of such complaints and a specific case to allow the competent authorities to verify," Allen Schmidova concludes.
Mgr. Alena Schmidhová studied the High School of Health in the field of Nurse Health (in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Karlovy in Prague in the study programme Ostetrovotäty - pedagogika (in 1992).
Since 2010, she has been the head of the care department and other non-medical departments and the recognition of qualifications in the education and science committee of the SCI.
During her career, she worked as a nurse at an internal unit bed, and she also served as a teacher at the High School of Health, where she was also an 8-year statutory deputy director.
From 2004 to 2009 she acted as the leading sister of the Czech Prison Service.
She published several medical textbooks and articles in the professional journals, devoted her teaching activities in the field of treatment.
He's not a member of any political party.
Don't let them hate you.
The writer of Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After long years, when he read, lived, but did not write, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) issues a new novel Wind, darkness, presence.
That it is not a narrow link, suggests the number of sides comparable to his most famous part of Houstina (Peter, 2001).
For Salon Kahud, another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it, so I wouldn't hate it.
To see all around you the new and new clones of the human stupid malignancy, young organisms affected by blind selfish efforts.
I don't even talk about us elders, faces destroyed by powerless petitions, wigs of soul, and otherwise transfusing ideologicals who are trying to sell their "product" with the expression of a little sales girl.
At the beginning of the thousand years, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my juridical friends, surprises, and hidden services.
It's over.
Sometimes I feel like my brain is burning out of my life on this planet.
I'd rather go for a walk, and then tonight at the lighthouse I read the book.
You're talking about a sense of doom, hate.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting old like us all?
A break occurred a long time ago, about ten years ago.
There was no name at that time.
Well, I lived after that.
There's a quiet boy in there, but he's still surprised.
I see another lonely cyclist, everyone in his tornado.
I was saved by writing books.
I participate in this grand, thousands of years of movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of an incomprehensible future.
The restless, breath-taking complexities of life, when every stone is a direct legacy of our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, when another and next generation of creatures emerge on the way to try-omyl, which in billions of interaction in a second creates some supernatural, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you view your writing as a continuous process, or did you start completely from scratch?
A speech, or better spoken dialogue, which leads to the right and left half of the brain, sometimes floats on the cold and forms in the book.
As the period of peace is affected by the silent metastases of war that may wake up one day, so the book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt like my life's not growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day I'm going to get stuck.
It's a file of questions that formulated the brain and holds them to the layers that are stored in the darkness "under the cold of consciousness".
Neocortex, the gray cortex of the brain, asking for older evolutionary powers, goes to the ancient summers of the brain tree.
He's talking to heartbreakers, he's asking for snakes, he's looking for an answer in the bird's flight, he's bringing his air to the clouds on the sky.
Yes, an ant law in me and a star sky over me.
Finally, the brain is asking for the world.
You're relatively often talking to ega metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain retains in its billions of connections and electrochemical connections all memories, experiences and experiences that the person in question has experienced.
This forest is logical and emotionally exposed and growing with trees of information, registers of memory, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, has constantly been exposed to variable presence, attempts to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes trouble from overload.
Analogically - as if you "fall" PC, from the program of speech emulator and translators from foreign languages you would get involved first in the operating environment, such as Windows, and after several failed restarts ended in the dark green viewing screens of Biosa, in the basic system that controls functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between processor and operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what it is - I am talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You remember her often - why do you regularly care about this type of regression?
Because it's a cave.
In the process of functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - there is a breakthrough.
It's good to tell Nietzsche, "He'd been looking into a trap for so long when he looked into it."
It feels like a man is lost if all hope disappears, mentally "death" and a new quality occurs.
And why do I care about it personally?
I'll answer like that.
Once a man fell into a cave and burned himself, days, months, and years ran, he was still burned and read, and the books taught him to swim - that is, to live.
He's got a kick.
I hope someone will help me with a written sentence, as the Hrabal texts helped me sometimes.
To what extent do you think of a reader, of a particular person who will read your text?
The one who can't tell anything meaningful, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think it was the best thing Arthur Rimbaud described in a friend's letter:
"I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the word and word formulation process."
From early on, he read the books of the old Czech stories, sailed in the north of Captain Noma, running after the Shadows in the dark streets.
At the same time, after all the emphasis on authors and their message, it sounds: "The sun shines on the worlds of other Karl Hynka Machy."
What if the book's out there?
You care about the reader's opinion?
In the reincarnation that comes to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, maybe years later, they're getting in touch on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life decisions.
The books are actually "life" or better called "world."
They are encoded in letters, experience, history of the regions of which language.
Whenever we can wake them up to life, when we let their seeds flow into the brain.
It is actually, in its own way, something forbidden by the divine - to explore other and other life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is the fact that DNA is stored in fours - according to the old demonological books, we allow magic.
After the book has been published - as it is - a string of author readings awaits you.
I remember you used to like reading.
Are you going back to it with joy, or do you feel it after years?
I'd rather talk about it today.
And what did I find out?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their basic signs - they're invincible, they don't notice themselves too much, they're friendly, you don't feel lonely with them.
I give an example - in the town of Red Kostelec was (and I hope he is still alive) one piece of book (name of course Črvenka), a happy friend and a good girl's bull.
At one drink, he introduced to me individual articles of the series of readers of my book, Houstina.
I looked in their eyes, and then I was shown a broken, sealed copy of my book.
In despair, I postponed the exact scheduled morning and soon the man cried.
We've all stood there, we've all slept and we've been drinking with our clothes.
Then the young blonde man didn't hold it, and he jumped his head out of the window into the snowflake.
It was on the ground.
We ran into the nightscape and ate a happy stream of feelingers, a sick soul of landscapers and a handful of fallen owners - came out and walked like wolves until morning.
Each of your books is formally and substantially different from the previous ones.
Does it also pay for the text of the Wind, the dark, the presence?
It's a story.
It's a story about one country over nine rivers and nine hours.
Ivan Bunin, in his novel Suchodol, puts into the mouth the words of an old Russian baja: on the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
She's lying in the dog, she's got a grey trigger on her.
Threat, fear, mystery.
It's never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we've been in hell a long time ago and we've been fighting what role we're going to play in this country.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it on a free flow of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
The cosi of a huge and unimaginable, similar movement of continents on the planet, affects our desire from such depth and in such a wide extent that it completely exceeds our attention - and thus with absolute certainty we do exactly in the intentions of our programmed task.
We are rewarded with dopamine inflection, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to get married, die in defence and gain new personal territories.
Sometimes it's going to be a mess and we're going to make sense.
Only then do we have the right to call people.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, stands on the coast of the ocean of ignorance and into the hole of the plates made from the dirty cape captures the waves of the wind.
I have to write so I can be human.
Obama's getting out of medical care
After the fierce criticism of President Obama yesterday, he withdrew from his frequent repeated and ambitious promise that "if you like your health program, you can leave it."
With the withdrawal of hundreds of thousands of notifications of statements from the vendors of the Republic of the Republic in the last few days, the president of the U.S. government has been accused of fraud.
Last night Obama broke his original promise.
"Many people who have health insurance are able to leave them," he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called a "distortion in the media" about statements, Obama called on the Americans who received this notification to look for new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more complex health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration claims that it should not be surprising that 5 per cent of the population who have purchased insurance for themselves may be required to change the programme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Care Act.
"I say this to these Americans at the same time: you deserve something better," Sebelius said in his statement before the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Access to Care Act, said that the launch of the Internet market has been "quickly" since October.
"I am disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
Sebelius, a member of the Sebelius Committee, who had taken over the microphone, yesterday pointed out to the council sitting behind her at the Committee's yesterday's meeting, which had taken place after a stormy exchange of views with the Republican Billy Long, a representative of Missouri, who was concerned about whether she should also be involved in Obama's care programme.
More than three hours during the Sebelius hearing, he repeatedly questioned why the "architect" Act on Available Care was not voluntarily issued by the government of sponsored insurance, and did not purchase a program through HealthCare.gov, which is now introducing millions of Americans.
What billionaire will you call next year?
Kellner, owner of the PPF group, wants to buy operator O2.
Both companies confirmed the negotiations, and according to various sources from the agency and from the back, they are already hand in hand.
The transaction notification should come even in November, probably before the start of the LTE frequency auction, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
This under the brand Sazka Telecommunications went to auction frequency for the LTE network.
And to the general surprise, until the time of the company's taste, there was no talking about telecommunications.
But Sazku is now leading a very experienced telecommunicative masquerade Robert Chvatal.
He began as the marketing chief of Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), later became director of Slovenian T-Mobile and lastly headed the Austrian side of the same operator.
The tape is playing several cards at once.
She went to the auction and now she's admitting she wants to launch a virtual at Vodafone's.
And it makes sense.
If the auction succeeds, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
This would probably not be popular under the normal circumstances of Vodafone, but according to the economic news, it may be part of much better cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone currently suffers from the agreement of competing O2 and T-Mobile operators who will fully share their networks.
That's how the water heater needs a partner.
And that could just be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the trend on the LTE network (as the new one can attract a specially defined spectrum), then Vodafone must not be allowed to auction, and will not be able to control the extraction of only limited spectrum (not enough frequency for all).
The hydrogens can be shared with Sazko on the network.
Vodafone lets Sazku into its 2G/3G network (respective of the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), allowing the company to quickly start the network.
The link between this begins to build an LTE charging network that can also be used by Vodafone.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The corresponding money could then be spent by Vodafone for some secure internet or cable TV provider.
And Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovenian O2 (Slovenian branch is a daughter of Czech) immediately obtains a full-time operator with still good profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big prayer to wait for restructuring.
In the auction LTE network, Kellner would have already won O2 and very likely in association with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that the networks will be shared.
The auction could thus finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafon, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárke.
Aneb two Titans of the Czech business against global revolutions.
Will Czech television ever be on the move without signing?
In the era of President Zeman's reign, a legendary scene with a beekeeper is not difficult to hear of complaints that collect the documents of the siege of the castle family.
In the past, no one has documented the traditional influence of Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Durdík, but to sign under it.
Truth is, the management has stopped the editors.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where such a presence of some journalists is taken to the landowners - whether it is a response to the direct order, or not to use vulgarism, the typical expression of unexplained empathy.
And if we are already assuming a general prognosis, we can't forgive ourselves the question of whether the changes in the conditions on television are being pursued by others, at least without the unscrupulous power interests that have not yet been given the opportunity.
The truth is, in developed countries, those who say that attempts to intervene policies in the field of broadcasting are not allowed.
The truth, of course, is also that it does not mean that there would be no complaints to the public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticise what they consider to be a tendency that they own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilisation stage yet, and we don't have this situation.
However, it may also be in a country that thinks it is the most corrupt in the world, black-white stories about bad policies and good journalists are more comfortable than the more complicated descriptions of a situation that affects the behavior of many imperfect human beings.
JAN JANDOUREK: Damn this country: the Presidents of the Force
It is almost a rule that in the key moments, there was no head of state in such a way that it could fulfil its national obligations.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally younger than five years, he would have experienced the end of his presidential period and events around Mnich's.
We would probably not win the war, but after symbolic resistance, flight could fly abroad, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could go to London right away and neglect its legitimacy.
And most of all, from this capitalization, the people of the woodland don't have to date.
Beneš was not a statesman and was still in charge of Minich, but for the wars he had already begun to leave the hill and in February 48 he was treated accordingly.
Being a better person, he could have gone to exile the third and undermine the legitimacy of the communists and their tortures.
It's a shame to talk about Hach.
They chose him by saying, "Mr. President won't be able to make a decision."
But he had to, even though the big decision with a knife on his neck at Hitler's office was probably not.
The chief of intelligence František Moravec, in the last days of March 1939, said what should be done so that the occupation he knew about the exact day did not go so smooth and with such profit.
The senior president and the bailout government did nothing, but they didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
The human burden of Gottwald made him repair his summer co-workers, as Moscow had ordered him.
People of Freedom definitely failed to share in normalization and had to sit him, already quite old.
That Husaka was a powerless and sick depressive old man in November 89, but that's the only gift.
Havel was lucky he hasn't met him in the office in the last few years, he's been saved by the worst.
Klaus is still a tennis student, but many of his senses suggest that thinking processes are no longer what they used to be.
And now we have this.
The head of the state and the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces look like we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, now there is no danger of the Republic's external threat.
Or maybe it's a threat, it's just not the way it is.
Then it is a question of whether it is extremely (from a historical point of view) good that the President is not fully in power.
But it's not normal.
Can't we elect a president in this country once again to be acceptable to someone who is mentally and socially healthy?
The distant planets, black movies, or a little fantasy about extraterrestrial life on earth are not the themes that American jazz saxophoneist Wayne Shorter would play on ice.
In the concept of his quartet, which, on November 6th, in the large hall of Prague, Lucerny ends this year's festival of the Sublime Party, which is all related to everything.
The scored quartet of the jazz saxophoneist Wayne Shorter are the instant feelings of musicians.
According to his job, they have two generations younger colleagues playing what they're just experiencing.
They approach music as fully improvised chamber affairs and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, is freshly eighty-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, a nine-year-old Grammy carrier, a former associate of Milese Davis, and today the largest living jazz saxophoneist - does not like to explain.
He doesn't talk too much about music, although his overall outlook on life is closely related to music.
In my 80 ’ s, I came to the conclusion that it is best to let life surprise me.
" Too many people plan everything, and then they're disappointed when things develop differently," said Shorter.
How the Houses from Thailand brought up the markets of the Paris bar
Maybe you're going over the house, and yet you don't know that you're dreaming about half a kilogram a year.
For example, it's in the mouth.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it is organic, nutritious and you have also been given care for the unique experience.
The offer was arranged as the first in Paris on the food list of his company at the beginning of October Elie Daviron, a chef and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
Bar, for whose name was William Burroughs' inspirational book Nahý lunch, you would find in the fashion 18 district near Montmartru a visited tourist.
With fresh avocados, cooked with red peppers, currants, and fried eggs, guests can again taste not only different larvae, mushrooms, or water brews, they also have four.
Carefully and specially packaged supplies (not to damage the body’s wings, legs, or eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, somewhere else it's normal.
The owner of the Paris bar with the push-in menu gives just a few reasons why to consume the house.
The first of these is an ecological benefit because the production of manure is much less expensive for our planet (which concerns finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional masses.
"In addition, it's a house that is an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," said Daviron for the Reuters station.
At the same time, a young chef does not stop his profession, simply insists on offering his customers a unique cooking experience.
According to him, he makes the right restaurant of pleasure, a sense of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just passing on a new experience," he explained.
Far from everyone's imagination, how it consumes a brooch of refined feathers, but the reactions of Paris bar customers to a served house are very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics will finally taste, even if they start with the smallest ingredients and finally choose the scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President Václav Matyás, President of the Federation of Businesses in the Czech Republic: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of orders and is not interested in addressing the problem of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings Programme was a positive signal for our construction, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, following the implementation of the measures, will support significant amounts of heating, but also opportunities for construction companies and manufacturers of construction materials.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2700 newly created jobs to the state.
In terms of fiscal policy, the state has significant package and multiplication effects, and it is also one of the most important growth measures.
As a result, the company's commitment to construction in the PRC is essentially incompatible with the government's resolution and calls for steps to be taken to allow further continuation of the programme so that further challenges can be identified within its framework.

In John Kerry's unprecedented confession, the American spy "went too far"
John Kerry indicated a change in the U.S. defence position regarding his monitoring programmes and, in his unprecedented confession, said that in some cases the espionage went too far.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as a "autopilot" in view of the gross disclosure of NSA espionage, which resulted from the informant Edward Snowden.
Public information has triggered a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr Kerry said through video-connection at an open government conference in London: "There is no doubt that the president and I and the others in the government have really learned about some things that have been done out of austerity, because this option was, with reference to the second world war, a difficult period of cold war and then, of course, 11 September."
So he became the first highly established member of the U.S. government to admit that the American espionage crossed the border, but stressed that it was not violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and explain it to people, and he is now conducting a thorough review so that no one will feel that abuse has occurred.
I assure you that this process does not prevent the abuse of the rights of innocent persons.
However, Mr Kerry insisted that the NSA is doing well and that its monitoring operations have saved many lives.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to fire themselves. ”
There is a radical extremism in the world, which is determined to kill and drive people into the air and attack governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented airplanes from crashing, unexploiting buildings, and people from being repaired because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The vice-president of the Senate for European Affairs said Thursday that US legislators are coming to Europe to respond to concerns from foreign countries that are related to alleged American espionage, and convinced Europeans that they must continue to join their forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that this week he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others and that they were concerned about their threats that he would stop participating in counter-terrorism organisations because they were disappointed in monitoring the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the national and security interests of the United States, it is really important for Europe to remain with us on a single ship, which, in view of the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, has been said in a discussion with Washington Murphy, a member of the democratic party and chairman of the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee on European Affairs.
And I am looking to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work in cooperation with terrorism regardless of their attitude towards NSA programmes.
The reports in the media that NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe have broken relations with some American allies, although the chief of agencies this week said they were inaccurate and reflected incomprehensible metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States,
Another discovery quoted documents from Snowden that the NSA was tracking the mobile phone of the German offices of Angely Merkel and others up to 34 world leaders.
The director of the National Intelligence James Clapper defended the spy of the allies as necessary and said that one of them was on both sides about the common issue.
In the middle of the call, Murphy said his office is planning a parliamentary trip that should be carried out this year, and hopes that members of both sides and chambers will appear in the delegation.
The names of other legislators to be published in the following days are to be published.
He said he's still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the purpose of the road was to help improve relations, he added that they would also be prepared “a well-defined educational measure”.
He said that the European leader must be honest with his own people with regard to espionage programs that they use for years.
"Since we are managing our monitoring programmes to better protect Europeans' rights, they also have to realize that we are not the only ones who are doing espionage here," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr Kerry's plan is to go this weekend to the Middle East and to Poland to respond to the inviolability already launched by the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by the American follow-up.
Australia appealed against a stay in Thai prison
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to a 15-year prison on Phuket Island when she falsely claimed she was attacked by a taxi driver, turned against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially accused by the Land Court on Phuket Island of a guilty charge when the Thai police said that a taxi driver along with two other men who had previously detained her attacked her in the early hours of Sunday 10 June.
However, the record from industrial television later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The P.D. on Phuket Island has been talking to Bamford for two days before she learned that she's invented an event.
Before the trial, she was held in the local police force.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a correctional facility with a low alert to the Phuket periphery, instead of being placed in prison for adult women.
He is a daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who, in the case of his daughter, asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about her daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It's obviously a challenging time, but we hope they'll come back to us as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed against the verdict and was released on bail of 50,000 bahts.
The reports from Australia indicate that, in the meantime, she spent her vacation in the Krabi recreation area in southern Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that the appeal could lead to a trial that her sentence would increase and put in prison for adults.
However, after the recent murder of Australian employee travel officer Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also try to correct the shameless picture for tourists, which could have just been the liberating verdict.
Jagr joked: Gol out of the gun?
He's got a gun in the defense belt and no one's ever caught him.
The escape also changed after a quick advance call.
Jaromir Jagr thus scored against Tampea on Wednesday night, on Thursday night then 119th winning goal in NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Petr Svobodova called the Czech Dragon Director and asked him if I should not be interested in advertising on their most modern train, Pendolino!" he wrote at the outset with the emphasis of Jagr.
I think we're kind of alike.
I guess I'm gonna have to finish the night training so I don't get any faster.
"I'm afraid then the Minister of Defence might call and would like to make an ad on a tricycle!" he added the smiles.
New Jersey also won a second victory in the row.
"And above all, you've noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottrov is taking," the Jagr closed.
Place of approval of the light bulb
The ruling election was more than the winners brought a bunch of defeated.
These are not only parties that did not even reach the Post Office (e.g. SPOZ) but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally ČSSD because of their internal breakdown.
Politicians, instead of the holiday candles, served us on the weekend of the election gulag.
The leaping election took place by the movement of Andrej Babiš, which promised the voters to change the political style of government today.
The division of the election result and the division on the winning side is a political one for Mr Milos Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the votes which the President Zeman publicly supported, or did not vote in the House.
Although the President has lost a strategic impact on other policies because of the unpleasant event, he still has a number of ways to get it back - for example by choosing the future prime minister.
While ČSSD's chances of getting a premium chair in my eyes are far away, entrepreneurs are approaching Andrei Babish.
The development of the ČSSD-supported Communist in comparison with the pre-election scenario of the ČSSD-supported Communism is a long distance from the fast and smooth creation of a stable government, but this development is only a better report for the business in the Czech Republic and thus for the economy.
Given the strong resistance of the UN to join the ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the ČSSD, the UN and KDU-ČSL coalition (a total of 111 Members).
Due to the breakdown in the ČSSD, which has thus become an unreadable and weak partner in the negotiation, the result of the coalition negotiations may be quite relevant for the ČSSD.
The ČSSD Minority Government, composed of "non-Germans" in the City, is probably not going to pass.
In addition, any government to which the ČSSD will be involved will be threatened by the unsatisfying ambitions of many Social Democrats who can lead sooner or later to further dissatisfaction on the side.
So I'm asking myself, "Can't we make a self-reliance to other early elections?"
Further elections would be a referendum on the force of the UN volition mandate.
The ČSSD plans for the introduction of sectoral data, the more significant increase in revenue or the construction of the State Bank, we hope under the table.
ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úzvat are in line with, for example, business support, direct fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), employment support for disadvantaged persons, lower VAT rates in the selected product.
The third area is the largest in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
Now, however, the ANO has a plan, so the program is the most likely of the ANO coalitions, ČSSD, KDU-CHSL would be more inclined to transport.
What I think is finally a better result than a left-wing program with all that is still moving in the economy.
