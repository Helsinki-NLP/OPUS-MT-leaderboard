Former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet is brought before the court
On Tuesday, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet for his alleged involvement in a massive corruption scheme on Petrobras state oil company.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office stated that Jose Dirceu will be sent to court for charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering brought this month.
Other twelve persons will be judged, including Joao Vaccari Neto, former Treasurymaster of the Workers Party, in power in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, former President of Petrobras business services.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the Party of Employers in custody for the links to this scheme.
Dirceu served as head of cabinet of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August of his home, where he was already under arrest at home, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a voting scheme in Congress over 10 years ago.
The prosecutors have stated that Dirceu has developed the Petrobras bribery scheme, accepted bribes while it is in operation and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it was closed at the end of 2013 for the scandal of the purchased votes.
According to the prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved approximately $2 billion in bribery and other illegal funds.
Part of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and their allies.
It would also include bribed to Petrobras directors in exchange for embroiled contracts.
Recovery of a "miraculous" student survivor of the Peshawar massacre
A paralysed teenager after being shot four times in the most complete terrorist attack in Pakistan has succeeded in a "miracle recovery" after being treated in the United Kingdom.
Mohammed Ibrahim Khan, 13 years old, the doctors in Pakistan told him that he would never be able to leave again.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked the public school of the Peshawar army last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will be removed later from the hospital.
Just nine months ago, in a usual morning of Tuesday, Mohamed stayed at the first aid hour and listened carefully to the teachers.
Even then, seven armed men painted in uniforms of security agents entering the public school of the army.
They carried out a simple mission: killing all the men, women, and children who were in their way.
"I can't forget what happened that day," says Mohamed with a sharp look.
I was sitting in the amphitheater, asking questions... and then I heard gunfires outside.
Terrorists entered and started killing. Our professor was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how four students got out of the amphitheater while the carnage was taking place.
Then he says he heard his friend, Hamza, screaming him.
He said, "Oh, brother, save me."
I held him by the hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he was in the head.
Most of those killed in attack were students
Hamza died in Mohammed's arms.
Mohamed remembers that immediately after that he lay down and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the shoulder down.
Peshawar doctors in northern Pakistan, then Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to go.
"When I saw him, I felt my soul coming out," says Sher Khan, Mohammed's father.
Those nine months were the hardest of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son so passionate of cricket would never be able to use his legs again.
They made a campaign and asked for help from Pakistan's television, attracting the support of famous people such as Imran Khan, a political cricket player.
Finally, they managed to raise funds to take Mohamed to the United Kingdom and provide treatment to the private hospital Harley Street in London.
The neurosurgery consultant Irfan Malik described Mohamed as "intimidated" when she reached the hospital.
“They spent the last [a few] months sleeping in bed, without being able to move from one side to the other,” says Malik.
He was weak, he put a lot of pressure on his back.
She wasn't in a very good shape.
A vertebrate from Mohammed's vertebral column was destroyed
Mohamed was shot in the shoulder, in the shoulder and in the back during the attack, and the lower vertical column was destroyed, leading to paralysis.
However, during a six-hour operation, Malik and his team managed to re-edit the nervous endings and rebuild the destroyed part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised by what happened next.
Just one week after the operation, Mohamed got up and started taking steps and walking.
We didn't expect such a good outcome.
It was a miracle," she says.
In less than two weeks from the operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed challenged the fate and began to walk again
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But it is decided to return to Pakistan, to join the army and fight terrorism.
"I feel I still have a chance to live," he says, showing the images with weapons drawn by him next to school manuals and styles
Physically, Mohamed becomes stronger every day, but the psychological trauma that passes through and now is unimaginable.
"My anger hasn't gone down," he confesses.
In my school, young children were killed.
What crime did they commit?
His mother wipes her tears, eats it up, and says, "I see my son walking again."
He may continue to blow his life.
The 4G "Super Voice" service from Three offers a better signal
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a lower frequency, which can cover a wider area
The Three mobile phone provider has launched a service in the United Kingdom that says it will improve reception within buildings and rural areas without a signal.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a spectrum with a lower frequency.
And other networks intend to introduce the same technology, known as "VoLTE over Long-Term Evolution".
This only works right now with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the coming months.
Three points out that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to service by 2017.
The chief in charge of technology, Bryn Jones, said: “By the end of the year, a million of our customers will have access to a better indoor coverage and will be able to use their phones in more places than they do now.”
The stars prepare for the pantomime train
The pantomime station is very important for theatres throughout the United Kingdom, many of them preparing for this year's training.
Now, at Christmas theatre, some of the greatest names in show business are involved.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in Censorship - the first in the role of one of the bad sisters, and the second in the role of the tooth.
They reveal the secrets of their pantomime at BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: "If I don't do anything, I feel guilty."
Steven Wilson was recently nominated as the great winner of the Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson was often called the most progressive musician in the rock world.
The musical talent won three awards at Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the award for the best album of the year for Hand.
In his five-star review, The Guardian called the album "a smart, expressive and captivating work".
Since 1980, Wilson has been the engine of most musical projects, the most famous of them being the Porcupine Tree rock band.
Now, before two shows with house closed at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launches a double LP only in vinyl format, Transition, to show the "more accessible" width of his solo activity.
He told the BBC about his love for vinyls and about his programme loaded and explained how comedy actor Matt Berry came to open his shows.
What does vinyl mean for you?
I grew up even in the end of the vinyl era, and I remember that I was just expecting the appearance of the CD, because the vinyl was so annoying.
You bought a disc, you went home with him, you had a scratch and you had to bring him back.
I love CDs, and for certain types of music, for example, classical ones, they're better than vinyls.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing more to really appreciate.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice table attached to the supply.
It's something you can hold in your hand, while you're letting yourself be absorbed by verses and covered by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it doesn't have the way to be so if some too young kids remember their vinyls like this kind of experience.
Do you have any vinyl you have in particular?
I admit we got rid of all the vinyls in the '90s.
All the vinyls we bought again.
I started out with the idea of restoring my 15-year-old collection, but I passed that limit.
The first disk I convinced my parents to buy was out of the Blue from the Electric Light Orchestra.
If I had still the original copy, it would have had sentimental value, but unfortunately, it's somewhere through a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes that the album will be a gateway to possible new fans
Why did you launch your new Transience compilation on vinyl?
This was originally conceived as an idea for the Day of the Speech Stores, but I missed the opportunity.
My house of suggested speeches to gather a few of my shortest and most accessible melodies.
I got to be easily obsessed with the idea of doing something "introduced into Steven Wilson's music" and kept the project unattended so that it was only released on vinyl.
Who buys the vinyl also receives a variant downloaded to the high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show her real light?
No, because, although I focus on longer music, there's something I've always appreciated more than anything: the melodic part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses rather on technical complexity than on the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, passed the time test because they always put the emphasis on the melodic side and the atmosphere.
What are you preparing for the Albert Hall shows?
I don't want you to reveal too much.
The repertoire will be completely different in every one of the nights.
First, it's going to be a version of the show Hand. It was. I had this year, but on steroids, with a few guests.
The second night there's gonna be more of an incursion into my history, it's being more directed to the fans who have been following me for years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show the other night?
And me and the rest of the tour team are big fans of [ Channel 4 comedy series] Toast of London, to the point where we always give out what it says.
I thought I'd listen to Matt's music, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
I talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to sing at the Royal Albert Hall.
I think I'm extremely lucky to have him in the open.
You have released albums from groups like XTC, Tarars for Fears and Yes.
How much does that affect your own music?
I'm not consciously inspired by this, but it's inevitable, when you construct these classic albums, they keep in mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was undoubtedly the most progressive old school album I ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that I returned King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all the previous year.
The current album, Hand. Erase., is much more open, because we were working at Tarars for Fears and XTC.
You're often described as the most busy progressive rock music.
Is that how you feel?
You can delete the word progressive.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people in today's music world and I'm not saying that with pride, because, please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has an ethics of incredible work of strength.
If I don't do anything all day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why working on remix was a gift, because it means I don't have to do my music all the time.
The music industry is a hard place to make a career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a profession.
I work every day and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I were lazy I don't think I'd survive.
Transition will be launched in the United Kingdom on 25 September.
Steven Wilson will sing at the Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September, as part of his 2015-2016 European tour.
A new contract brings jobs back to Skytrans
The new Skytrans reorganized part of the airline staff who lost their job when the old Skytrans went into bankruptcy.
Skytrans, a company redeployed from northern Queensland, has awarded a $25 million contract to transport the employees of the QGC natural gas company, which means that 18 crew members have regained their job.
Skytrans, a company owned by Wild's family, became very active in January, after the Newman government rewarded the subsidized routes that form a large part of the airline's business.
The complaint led to several communities dealing with an isolated potential, and Warren Entsch, the national-liberal federal parliament for northern Queensland, was the representative voice of the criticisms of the national-liberal government.
Another company, Collins Aircraft Holdings, re-launched Skytrans in March.
Michael Thine, Skytrans's executive director, said that the airline contract with QCG has already created jobs.
"We managed to redeploy 18 members of Skytrans staff with the full standard, as pilots and crew members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff, with direct logistics experience in managing flight operations for QGC customers.
In just five months, we have grown 100% of the workforce, 78 staff members being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract aims at Skytrans extending its flight operations from its central headquarters in Cairns, which serves Cape York and Stramtor Torres, and including a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 return flights a week for the staff of QGC and for Brisbane entrepreneurs to locations in Chinchilla and Tarroom, on its Dash-8 flights from 36 locations, starting on Monday, October 26.
Tony Nunan, executive director of the QGC, said Skytrans received the contract following a tender procedure.
"We are pleased that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a company in Queensland," he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains high-quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal parliamentary and fresh mom Kelly O'Dwyer gets the advice to make her a bigger reserve of milk to avoid ratting votes in the room
Looks like they're going to be more women in the office.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be invested on Mondays and there are strong signs that more women will occupy the portfolios.
One of the government's rising stars, Kelly O'Dwyer, has been advised to make a larger supply of milk for her newborn to prevent breast-feeding from taking part in her duties in Parliament.
The advice comes from the government's disciplinary officer, Scott Buchholz, who later consulted his laborist counterpart to find out what is the most appropriate approach for a parliamentarian who is breast-feeding, in accordance with the orders in force.
Liberal parliamentary Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter, Olivia.
In accordance with the rules in force - the set of rules governing the behaviour of parliamentarians in the Chamber - the mammarys who milk obtain a power of vote in Parliament.
This means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
However, Whip did not know about this exemption before consulting the opposition's disciplinary officer, Chris Hayes, on this issue.
Things got too fast on two occasions, when O'Dwyer couldn't attend a division meeting and couldn't fulfill his obligation to hold a speech because he just started breast-feeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked if the MP was planning to make a larger milk reserve instead of breast-feeding.
Scott Buchholz, parliamentarian of Queensland, is responsible for the government's discipline.
Later, the two resolved their dispute.
Both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources of Buchholz and O'Dwyer said to Fairfax Media that the representative of the Higgins division was angry when he was told to make a bigger supply of milk instead of breast-feeding his daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This fact is revealed even when new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull works at the establishment of his new cabinet.
Buchholz, the national liberal parliament of Queensland, has been promoted as a responsibility for discipline by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of attempting censorship in February of this year.
O'Dwyer, along with Amanda Rishworth of the Labourist Party and his son, Percy, is one of Parliament's three monkeys.
The former disciplinary officer, Phillip Ruddock, was removed only a few days after Abbott faced a motion of censorship by which he wanted to be removed from office, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nikolkolc, the liberal of Tasmania, was also promoted and appointed to be responsible with the attached discipline.
Nickolc last kept the front page of the newspapers, after it was discovered that he had sent Turnbull a message asking him to refuse to contest Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after her daughter Olivia was born in May.
It is one of the three parliamentarians who have become nuns this year.
The spokesman for the Labour Party, Catherine King, said Wednesday that the voting power for breast-feeding mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.
"Now she's [seven years]," she wrote on Twitter.
The discipline officer should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who said Wednesday he wants more women in his cabinet.
"No one wants to see more women in terms of power, influence, in Parliament, in the ministry, in the whole country," the Prime Minister told reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included one single woman in his first cabinet and, after the pressures supported to increase female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet, after his resignation in December.
Five things he wants the business environment from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will the markets react?
Mal Maiden, an editor at BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull might have on Australia's business sector.
Tuesday, the lobbying groups in the business sector didn't know how to manifest their enthusiasm more strongly when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country's branches as prime minister.
The main reason is that much of what many of them would have wanted to see was abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or simply reached a suspension negotiated because of Abbott's "crash-or-crash-through" political style.
Representatives of interest groups spoke to the union about their hope in the ability of Turnbull to satisfy the public interest, reach a political agreement and do things well.
So what exactly is expected of the country's largest companies and their representatives of our new prime minister?
ChAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to exceed negative advertising.
Turnbull himself set the objective of the Free Trade Agreement with China.
In his first speech in which he mediated that challenge, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (CHAFTA) represented the central point of his attack on the laborist leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticized "the revolting economic schoovinism" of the Labour Party regarding that problem and expressed concern about the racist temptation of critics.
"In the context of ChAFTA, the winners are, numerically, much more than the rewards," he said in the same speech.
The business environment hopes that he will win this debate.
Don Argus, a legendary businessman, stressed that this is an essential point, being supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the largest 100 companies in the country) and by James Packer, the billionaire of the gaming industry.
The business environment wants to conclude this agreement, and it will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to exceed negative advertising and negotiate with the whole Senate.
The Minister for Small Enterprises, Bruce Billson, supports the recommendations of the Harper Analysis.
This could lead from the beginning to some differences in the business environment.
The impact assessment shall apply in the case of large mergers and other contracts to decide whether consumers will suffer due to lack of competition.
It is called "effect assessment" because it takes into account not only the actions and intentions of the company, but also the effect they will have on competition and the market.
The way in which this evaluation is edited is extremely important for the result.
The Harper analysis of competition law recommends a change in the impact assessment, which will make it more difficult for large companies to remove smaller operators from the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was on the side of the Australian Business Council and the great retailers.
Turnbull now makes sense that he wants the entire cabinet to think about what he's going to do next.
CAA jumped as a fire to claim that, if Turnbull follows the recommendations of the Harper analysis, consumers would be required to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the whole business environment is the one that advised the new prime minister to have greater respect for the cabinet processes, which Turnbull seems to do by letting Bruce Billson, the Minister of Small Enterprises (which is part of Harper's recommendations) support his arguments in front of his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could help prevent breast cancer
Spanish researchers followed women between the ages of sixty-eight.
Those who eat mainly plants, fish and olive oil have reduced the likelihood of breast cancer “significantly”.
Terrence Howard puts the multiplication table under the sign of the question
Terrence Howard is of the opinion that I completely misunderstood arithmetic.
The negative character in Empire told Rolling Stone magazine he doesn't think that one time is equal to one.
"How can it be equal to one?" he said.
Once I do one, it means that two are of no value, because once he has no effect.
Once I do two, because the fourth root of his four is two, so what is the fourth root of his two?
It's supposed to be one, but we're told there's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's professors did not agree with his theory, so he gave up at Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
"I guess you can't close your eyes when you know something's wrong," he explained.
Howard found for his parallel approach to mathematics the name of "Terryology".
The actor testifies that he spends his time cutting and reassembling fores, wire, magnets and plastics to illustrate his "once" theory and other similar theories of his.
He told the magazine that he and his former wife, Mira Pak, spent up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
The Rolling Stone editor described Howard's creations as "complex, two-dimensional and three-dimensional infinitives, connected with copper wire or magnetic captures".
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive American patent 20150079872 A1 ("Systems and methods for improved construction materials applications").
Also, the actor from "Following an Idol" says that Pythagorean Einstein and Tesla would "take her mad" if he saw Terrorism.
"You know," he says, "I've been asking myself since I was three or four years old why does a ball turn around?"
Why doesn't it become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard added that he hopes to change the whole course of education.
"This will be the last century in which our children will learn that once they do one," he said.
They won't be needed to grow up in ignorance anymore.
In twenty years now, they'll know that once they do two.
We're about to reveal a new truth.
Real universal mathematics.
We're gonna check it out in 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
On Tuesday, during the "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star sang little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, interpreting "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then showing his vocal qualities with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" sung with Agillera's voice.
In turn, Fallon did a good job imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also interpreted, in turn, versions of "I Can't Feel My Face" from The Weekend.
This week, Grande's name still appears in the press.
It was the same day at "Good Morning America", where it opened the show with the gogoash lens incident.
Taco Bell hopes that the "Cantina" restaurants will serve to become points of urban interest
Would you like to spend an elegant night in the city?
Taco Bell is an option.
On September 22, the Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain will open a new location in the Wicker Park area in Chicago, offering a tapas menu of aperitifs, a fresh painting by a local artist and even alcoholic drinks.
It is the first test location of Taco Bell Cantina's restaurants, which is aimed at young people, concentrated in the center of the city.
Taco Bell, which has nearly 6,000 restaurants in the US, has its roots mainly in the suburbs and is associated with cheap, fast-prepared food, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With a payment note Taco Bell averaged 7 USD, the company used drive-through and fast services to attract the number of customers needed to make a profit.
But Taco Bell says that in order to address a new generation that "seeks the most central urban environments in which to live, work and have fun", the test locations must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
To make a drive-through, you need the ground.
Can you imagine what it means to buy an acre of land in an area like Wicker Park?
"Don't let yourself," said TODAY for USA Neil Borkan, the French Taco Bell who will operate the location in Chicago.
At the Chicago location, the new menu will be prepared along with traditional offers Taco Bell, in an open kitchen, where "you will see the food at your own disposal" before it is prepared, said the Associated Press Meredith Sandland, head of development at Taco Bell.
Also at the new location will be served frozen wine, beer and alcoholic beverages, following the recent example of most Taco Bell competitors.
Now, seventy-five Starbucks cafes offer "night" menus that include beer, wine and tastings.
A thousand of the around 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic drinks.
The company said another Taco Bell Cantina location will open in San Francisco next to AT&T Park this month, replacing the drive-through service and parking with an internal court and a window for sale.
These changes in location, atmosphere and annexes indicate that the fast food restaurant chain also wants to attract other customers outside those who are looking for fast food at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a higher quality cooking line in 2012, when he opened the Cantina and more expensive burritos menus to compete with Chiptle, the project being supported by a advertising campaign focused on the content of new preparations proteins.
If they succeed, Cantina restaurants will be a step further towards a higher level.
Taco Bell said that by 2022 he intends to open 2000 restaurants in the US.
According to Sandland for AP, "a few hundred" of them will be like "Cantina".
They burned the phones in the middle of the night: Elton John makes Putin's court
Russian President Vladimir Putin phoned Elton John on Monday night only a few days after the British artist publicly said he wanted to meet the Russian politician to discuss Russia's anti-gay legislation together.
The British gay singer, declaredly, tried unsuccessfully to get an interview with Putin while he was in Russia in November 2014, one year after he challenged the protests in this country and held two concerts in 2013, during a period of anxiety in the history of this state, after the adoption of controversial laws, which prohibits "homsexual propaganda" in the minority.
In 2014, at St. Petersburg, the British artist criticized these laws and made the following statement in front of fans: "Well, I'm gay, I always felt that I was welcome here in Russia."
If I wasn't honest about what I was, I couldn't compose these songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express my life.
If we start punishing people for that, then their world will lose humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist was disappointed that they wanted to meet Putin to discuss this controversial issue.
So far, there's no clear information about the phone conversation between the two personalities.
Cocos sings all over the ANRP file
The businessman Dorin Cocos is trying to save himself from a suspensive sentence, "cantand" in front of the judges and detailing how he has given millions of euros to the former members of the ANRP Commission.
Yesterday, at the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the file in which the son or Alin Cocos, former head of DIICOT Alina Bica and former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of ANRP Deployees, Dorin Cocos was struck by the lightning of sincerity.
He acknowledged all the charges and told the court how he helped the businessman Gheorghe Stelian in the case of ANRP's dismissals, in exchange for asking him to be tried more quickly and to take into account his collaboration.
Thus, Cocos showed that he had known Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he was involved with this after several real estate business.
He specified that Sergiu Diacomatu met him in 2010, and he told him he was working at ANRP.
Later we found that (Diacomatu, n.r.) is Vice-President, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at ANRP, I asked him to help us.
I promised her money, 2.5 million euros, the money I told her I'd give her in more cash.
I also promised him political support to remain in office.
"Diacomatu told me then to help me, but he needs support," said Dorin Cocos in the courtroom.
He further said that, through knowledge, he entered into connection with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then the head of the Central Commission for Disposals, who promised him 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second file, I knew that he wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacomatu already had political support, I also gave it five million euros.
I gave Dmitrean a million euros to Dragos Bogdan. I gave him 800,000 euros.
I need all of this money in cash to make sure that the file is resolved.
"That's all I said: to solve the file, to get rid of the money," said Cocos.
Asked why he had done these things, Dorin Cocos said he had received eight million euros for the positive resolution of Georghe Stelian's second file.
I received, for the second dossier, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I only got 1.2 million euros left.
I also met Alina Bica in 2013.
"I've never talked to this money or land," Cocos said.
He also showed that "it was notable that the ANRP all members understood before the seat."
I didn't have the emotions that they wouldn't vote positive.
All the functions were political in ANRP, but I personally did not help Diacomatu.
"I told him that I only helped him politically to calm him down," Cocos concluded his statement.
Ponta brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was on DNA yesterday, for just five minutes, while he filed new documents in the "Turceni - Rovinari" file.
Victor Ponta fled to DNA with a document from the European Court of Justice
Convinced that the case prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the basis of the file in which he is investigated for counterfeiting in private signatures, complicity to tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went on his own initiative to DNA, although the documents he could have been sent by a lawyer.
It wasn't to be like that, the attorney intruded didn't have time, the first leaving after five minutes, while he left several documents for registration.
I wanted to make a decision by the European Court of Justice on 3 September, which explains what is going on with the service contracts.
I say we've done business, the prosecutor says we haven't done, the European Court of Justice told us to both, because, as long as taxes have been paid, it's okay.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, certainly, for all European Union courts, we have no case here," said Prime Minister Victor Ponta at the time of the DNA issue.
The ponta further stated that, either in terms or in terms of terms, the European Court of Justice should apply, if we are members of the EU.
By then, the prime minister expected the prosecutor to read the European Court's decision and call it back to the hearings, but also to give him an answer to his requests, including the disposing of the file.
John Isi rejected the mandate without television
In Romania today, there is no legal provision that forces you to watch television.
And you don't even own such a device, since you pay your TV fee once with your energy bill.
But if you're the head of the state, things change radically.
Because, in practice, it is understood that the position of the President of Romania is also included in the record of everyday realities.
President Johannis merges every day into a total quiet in the office or from the Cotroceni
Only that, to the shock of even the closest people you have from the Cotrocene Palace, Klaus Johnnis refuses to have a TV in the presidential office.
And since you don't look at TV - at any program, not even at the RTL or Pro Sieben, the president doesn't listen to the radio and doesn't read the newspapers.
In addition, it does not even receive "negative monitoring" which, for example, the predecessor or a priority request.
Instead, Johannis was glad to receive only the report with the news that put him in a positive light.
And in addition to this informational self-isolation, where the only step is to access the facebook, much more serious is the blocking to which, through its passiveness, the head of the state of impinging the entire activity of the presidential administration.
And that's because, although it's been so long since he was installed, Johannis hasn't signed the loyalty statements yet more than half of the presidential administration's employees.
What is becoming a more serious problem, both human and legal.
Lists and peace
Those from the presidential background are already clear that no one can remove the "feng shui" from the head of the state.
Where there is quiet and peace.
What's right is, just after nine o'clock without a minute (no more, no less!), in the morning, when Sibia's ex-edul demands the presence of officials.
A custom that probably didn't get rid of in time when it ran the city's capital from Cibin.
And about the fact that Johannis doesn't want television in the office they've already been born with countless legends, being already people from the Cotroceni Palace who have come to turn to the variant that the president would try to avoid monitoring it.
Especially that he doesn't have any radio equipment.
Only that, at this pace, follows to meditate as quickly as in the dark, because even lighting devices can hide audio-video recording techniques.
Just fine.
Also another surprise from the Cotroceni Palace is the delivery to the head of the state of "pzoitive monitoring" of the President's activities.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Johnnis or his wife, the head of state will get his continuum on the living room.
If not, no!
And more interesting is that "negative monitoring" was prohibited under conditions where, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as following night television broadcasts in which he was criticised, but as a matter of priority, the negative news.
That doesn't mean that he helped him with something, but that's what the gesture counts!
And at least he can never have an excuse that he wasn't well informed from alternative sources.
Not outside, not confirmed
Now, to the end, let's look at it and the mystery why Klaus Johannis doesn't want to look at it on TV.
By then, however, it would be more important to resolve, regardless of the wording, the contractual situation of hundreds of employees of the presidential administration.
Those who, in order to be able to work here, are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the head of the state in charge and who must bear and sign it.
Only that, from December and so far, Klaus Johnnis has not signed for confirmation even half of these statements, although it should have taken up to 30 days.
Thus, hundreds of employees, representing more than half of the staff at the Cotroceni Palace, have an uncertain situation now.
Because, legally speaking, if the head of state does not personally sign the statement, they should be given out.
Only that they all didn't get a negative opinion!
So, in a sense, I can come and ask the inspectors of the Court of Auditors, who will find that, over half a year, hundreds of people have received their wages at least somewhere in the law.
This would also be decided by the president if he gave them out or confirmed their positions, making his decision strict.
Authorities have stated that a teenager launched an attack on Pope Francis during his visit to the United States
The plan inspired by ISIS of a teenager to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S. was rather "aspirational" than operational, confirmed a police source for Fox News on Tuesday.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August, when law enforcement authorities dropped the plan.
The plan is the same as the Texas Representative Mike McCaul, president of Internal Security, said a source for Fox News during a Sunday interview.
"We monitor very carefully the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States of America," McCaul said at "This Week" from ABC.
Pope Francis was not mentioned as a specific objective of the plan in a bulletin.
the joint information of the FBI and the Department of Internal Security of 14 August, which states that the adolescent was planning to use several attackers, firearms and explosives, with the aim of "a foreign deminer during a high-level event".
The bulletin mentions that the minor has been radicalized through social networks.
A teenager may suffer from a mental illness, has declared a source of law enforcement authority for Fox News, but without giving details about the young person's disease.
Also on Sunday, McCaul acknowledged the potential for an attack by a so-called "unique wolf" at the level of the whole nation and noted that it was informed by the Secret Services about a "strict secret location" for the visit of the Pope.
And with that comes a great risk of security... and, as the time approaches, I think we'll all be very vigilant and protect him when he gets to the United States.
Matt Dean from Fox News made this material.
The skeleton from the medieval period discovered in the tree suffered a violent death, say experts
Irish archaeologists have revealed fascinating details about the strange skeleton dating from the medieval period, found at the root of a 215-year-old tree.
Colloney's farm, Sligo, fell during a storm spent this year, bringing to light the macabre sight of a skeleton caught between its roots.
The Irish National Monuments Service has brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to dig up and analyse the remains, thus discovering an exciting story.
"He was murdered violently," Marion Dowd, director of the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services, told FoxNews.com.
In the upper part of the chest there are wounds caused by knife. There is another such trace in the left hand, which suggests that he is trying to defend himself.
The skeleton is of a young man between the ages of 17 and 20.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that residues are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We cannot know whether he was killed in a fight or in a personal dispute," says Dowd, noting that the body was buried after a Christian ritual, with his head headed west.
"Probably buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd said for FoxNews.com that whoever planted the tree didn't know about the graveyard.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents that testify that there was a church and a cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible traces of them.
There is another unusual aspect of the discovery: the height of the youth.
"He had 1 meter 77," says Dowd.
For the early medieval society, that means a lot.
The federal government spends $1.5 million to study what babies think about eating
National Institutes for Health (NIH) spent nearly 1.5 million dollars studying what young children think about food.
The project, known as "The Way in which Babies and Small Children Perception Food" is derived from the University of Chicago and has so far established that young people are not predisposed to eat food from other people or other people who have taken care of it.
According to the project's funder, "adequate nutrition is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have healthy diets from a nutritional point of view".
There is evidence that the first food models of infants and young children have long-term consequences for the health of all lives.
The pressure for this study is that research into how babies eat is lacking.
“Despite the complexity and significance of the food selection, child development psychologists have given little attention to the way in which babies and young children perceive, learn and understand food, the funding said.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social influences on the choice and consumption of food in infants and young children.
Researchers say about babies that they have "limited knowledge in the food field".
Children between the ages of three and six "know more about food than babies and young children", but are "extremely mofturos" consumers.
An actress who played "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of improper exposure in Tennessee
An actress who played the TV series Star Trek: Voyager was arrested in the summer of Tennessee, being accused of being exposed to children.
More media channels report that Jennifer Ann Lien, 41-year-old actress who played Kes' role in the television series, is accused of two innocent exposure offences, in which children under 13 were involved, according to the arrest report.
Officers of the Roane County Sheriff's office have brought the arrest warrant on September 3rd, to the home of Lien in Harriman, where they say they found an empty shed on the couch.
Officials have stated that Lien has refused their requests to dress.
The chief of the Harriman police, Randy Heidle, says that Lien's several charges were brought to him, including the corporal injury, after the April incident in which he says that Lien entered a police car with a personal car.
He still doesn't know if he's a lawyer.
Police identified the murder victim found in the Epping forest
A man whose dead body was discovered in a tourist forest was identified.
On 9 September, Hidir Aksakal, 53 years old, was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping forest, north-east of London.
The Turkish-born man lived in Margate, Kent, and had close links to the Green Lanes area in Haringey, north of London.
Last time he was seen in Green Lanes in the morning of Monday, 17 August.
A postmortem analysis proved that he was killed, and the detectives say that his body is probably several weeks in the Epping forest.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo of the Metropolitan Police said: “Mr Aksakal was well-known locally as the Cetin Boxer and we hope to find out from the Green Lane community information that will help us in the investigation.
Hollow Ponds is a popular and popular tourist spot, where there is a cafe and a lake for boat trips.
It is also surrounded by streets with intense traffic.
We ask all those who have been in the area in the last few weeks and may have observed some unusual or suspicious activity to come and discuss with us.
Super Chief: Six Women Jumble Between Motherhood and Service
Unlike any other country in the world, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, there is no centralized policy on maternity leave in the United States of America.
Two weeks ago, when the executive director of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, announced that she was pregnant with twins, but was going to take a very short maternity leave and "crazy" in her spare time, the 40-year-old woman was criticized on a broad scale for encouraging a culture that awaits superfemous or nothing.
But Mayer, she herself a symbol of the top woman, to be guilty of unrealistic expectations?
How do other women's leaders manage?
Seema Patel, a lawyer and deputy director of the San Francisco Labour Standards Office, just got a job in government in Washington DC a few years ago, when her boss surprised her with an unexpected advice.
"I don't know anything about you," said her boss.
But if you're going to make a family in the future, grab your leave now.
Patel's employer was the federal government, and she didn't even get a maternity leave paid as part of her employment contract.
By then Patel was unmarried and very focused on his career, and the family was the last thing he thought about.
But she listened to her boss' advice.
He avoided using his days of medical leave for four years, so when he was pregnant with her first child, two years ago, he narrowed down three months of vacation paid.
Six months ago, when she was born as a second child, Patel could no longer apply the same strategy.
The four months of leave that he took were completely unpaid.
Patel says she didn't feel any rejection from her colleagues, but she has a problem with the structure of work.
"It seems very discouraging to anyone trying to have a family," she says.
Send a message: Your country does not value your becoming a parent.
Karen Choi, Vice-President of the Capital Group asset management firm, says that any female employee who is and mother should be praised.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six - month - old baby, describes the yoke between the quality of mother and job as “a constant struggle”.
The secret to not suffocating is to have "an incredible family next to you" and a bona fide and a babysitter, to accept that there are things that will not be the best (“not everyone can be Martha at home”) and just go through it.
Choi says he took an increasing maternity leave for each child, starting from two months and half for the first and ending with six months for the last.
This makes it an exception, especially in her area of activity.
When your child is sick, he has fever, vomiting and you stay all night to take care of him and you know that the next morning you have to take your other kids to school, then go to work...
Then it becomes very complicated," she says.
However, its company supported it and noted that the performance of its investment portfolio had nothing to do with it.
When she went into the finance industry, after college, about 20 of her college colleagues chose the same way, she said.
Today, about 90% of them have given up.
Women who give up their jobs, then start again, don't have the same chances at the top paid well, she says.
It's hard to stay: "In the short term it's a sacrifice, but in the long term the results are seen."
Anyway, her children helped her make sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me go further is that I'd like to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates scientific researcher and professor Kelly Posner, age 48.
The children know that their mother is helping, in turn, to save human lives.
Posner, founder and director of the Center for the Evaluation of the Risk of Suicide from the University of Colombia, says it is important that women know that they can have a "great objective" with regard to their career and to meet it.
It's very important that women think I can have a vision.
Most people don't allow themselves to believe this," she says.
He once held a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a web site when he was charged in eight months.
She also helped with technology, she says, because she can stop the car and answer the phone after she picks up her children or responds to an e-mail from the march.
The youth between maternity and an applicant career was helped by an optimistic personality, inclined to solve problems, she says. From the ability to bring things to a good end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, at the age of 33, the Executive Director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and the mother of two children, says that making motherhood and career work together only through private aid networks, such as beans, is wrong.
"You should not be lucky or win the lottery to succeed," she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - mentioning very small wages, the poor health system and the lack of paid maternity leave.
"As a society, we don't care about each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who just were born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while following law school courses, gave birth to her child while she first won.
With a husband and a child based on the medical assistance provided by the scholarship, the labour leader was able to take a maternity leave for only two weeks, then return to work.
Lisa Mosko, a fashionist and mother-in-law of two children, says that less and less women will abandon their profession if they will benefit from more social support, in the form of day care services by companies, maintaining programs established by common agreement and accepting that efficient work does not mean staying over the programme.
In the face of the constraints of logistical order, says Mosko, there is additional pressure to act in an area where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitomy of the lack of taste (“mamma’s hat” is one of the most serious insults).
"The image is part of our job - it raises you or shoots you down," she explains.
Mosko's "permanent negotiation" for its multiple roles to work harmoniously means to keep its appearance and a beautiful bag in hand, from which, however, sometimes to fall into a double play.
If he remembers that men are fathers, society could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers to the extent they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, president and executive director of the New York Homes Authority, who deals with the homes of over 400,000 new Yorkers and has over 11,000 employees, says that maternity and career don't mean talking about "equilibre".
The notion of balance is a bit inappropriate.
She looks rather like a balance sheeter," she says.
Mother of three children, one of whom has only three months, she just took a seven-week maternity leave after she was born this year.
"It was a very important period for the agency," she explains.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to give her parental leave, and she managed to have a flexible program, which means to leave early or late, so that she could breastfeed her child.
Olatoye, who runs with her friends every morning ending at 06:00 ('s cheaper than therapy') is still breast-feeding.
At work, he tried to create an environment "friendly for parents", in which a child's delay is allowed, and the reply to e-mails should not be sent immediately from the office.
"The concept and family concept have changed and changed very much," says Olatoye.
"The family is very different from what was 25 or even 10 years ago".
The job is the one that needs to adapt.
Russian killers say they fooled Elton John about a Putin's phone.
For scientists it seemed too beautiful to be true: a phone call from Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, to Sir Elton John, a singer and militant for the rights of sexual minorities, in which to discuss the rights of homosexuals.
Unfortunately for John, it wasn't true: despite an exuberant post on Instagram in which the Russian leader's gratitude for addressing him about the problem immediately became clear that anyone who had called him on Monday night would certainly not have been Putin.
The Kremlin had already declared that he had no knowledge of that conversation.
And on Wednesdays, two famous Russian humorists admitted that they, not the president, were foreign voices from the other end of the conversation.
"We thought it was a little bit likely that Putin would like to meet him or call him, or at least not too soon," says Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague Alexei "lexus" Stoliarov, was given the floor of President Dmitri Peskov.
"It seems that Elton John was actually waiting for this phone, so he immediately believed that it was really a conversation with the right people we were giving us," he told the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.
He said, "Thank you, it was the surprise of the day."
This day and this conversation were the most beautiful and beautiful of my life.
In order to complete John's plight, the two announced that they would publish a recording of the conversation at a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives did not make statements about the speculations.
On the basis of the story, the comments he made during the weekend, in which Putin criticised him for his "ridiculing" attitude towards homosexuals while fighting for LGBT rights in Kiev, in particular criticising a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibits the spread of "propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations" among minors.
"I would like to meet him [on Putin], to talk about him," John told the BBC, saying that although the idea was "probably unrealistic", it still deserves a trial.
Then, on Monday evening, the singer called off the distrust of observers when he published a message on a social network, claiming that Putin responded to his critics by taking the phone and calling it.
He said that “he looked forward to meeting [the president] in front of him to discuss LGBT equality in Russia”.
Unfortunately for John, Putin was not the one at the other end of the line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for the telephones given in the joke of many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks well English, played Peskov's role and claimed to be the interpreter of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, true Peskov told reporters Tuesday that Putin would be "ready to meet Elton John and answer all his questions", but Kremlin did not receive any such request from the singer.
The Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of the post on Instagram, he added, "especially because it is not written in full in correct English".
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written such a grammatical mistake.
Even before the Russian duet declared his public fair, local media channels already suspected that John was the victim of a joke.
Some users of the online environment identify Krasnov as guilty, known for the fairs made by the telephone politicians who record them and post them on his YouTube channel as Vovan222.
Phone calls to public people in a joke, then publishing the recordings became a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is considered by many as the founder of the genre, has developed his talent to make Ukrainian politicians do it.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television, imitating Anton Geraşchenko, the direct adviser of the Interior Minister, Arsen Avakov.
He imitated Geraşchenko so well that last year he spoke to Dnipropetrovsk's former governor, Ihor Kolomoski, better than six hours in several days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections, which led to massive street protests after the mass fraud reports.
As Arkadi Dvorkovich, the Councillor of the then President, Dmitri Medvedev, convinced the president of the electoral commission, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to grant it.
In addition to numerous Russian celebrities, among his victims were former President Urss Mihail Gorbaciov, the Prime Minister of Kiev and the champion at the Vitali Klitschko Box and the Russian Minister of Sports Vitali Mutko, whom he hesitated to apologize for the behavior of his athletes.
Last year, Krasnov would have called the Belarusian president Aleksandr Lukașenko, becoming the son of the Ukrainian leader, Viktor Ianukovici.
It was so convincing, that the person from the other end, whose voice looked like Lukashenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial statement that he would like to discuss with Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia.
Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the "propaganda" law, told The Guardian that John should not bother Putin with a "so irrelevant subject" and that he was ready to meet with the singer to explain Russia's position.
Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper opened an online survey for readers, in which 39% of respondents thought that Putin and John should meet, and 22% considered that such a meeting would damage Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, more than 3 million people a year die premature due to air pollution from outside, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is wood and coal burning for housing and cooking, but research reveals that such an alarming reason is agricultural emissions from Europe and the US, where it represents the main reason for these deaths.
The report warns that if no measures are taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projects should signal an alarm to public health agencies around the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, an environmental expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by air rain are caused by tiny particles, which can be inhaled deep in the lungs.
They cause heart attack and stroke, which are responsible for three quarters of the 3.3 million annual deaths, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory diseases.
Research did not include the effects of indoor air pollution, for example from cooking fires, which are estimated to cause another 3.4 million deaths a year.
The new study, published in the Nature newspaper, is the first one to highlight various sources of air pollution from outside and estimate the number of premature deaths caused by them, taking into account road traffic, fossil fuels and other sources.
Researchers have used a detailed computerized model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on various populations, including new information on how pollution affects the inhabitants of China and India.
A third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of smoke-discipline fuels, such as wood and coal, for the heating of buildings or cooking, and of the use of clean diesel generators for electricity, all of which are recognized dangers.
The consumption of this type of domestic energy results in half of the 645,000 annual deaths in India and one third of the 1.4 million annual deaths in China.
However, the research found that ammonia agricultural emissions had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld of the Chemical Max Planck Institute in Germany, which led the research.
A fifth of deaths at global level are caused by these emissions, mainly from cattle, birds and pigs and from excessive use of fertilisers.
Ammonia reacts with exhaust gas from traffic and industry and produces small particles, being the main reason for the deaths due to air pollution in the US, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," says Lelieveld.
Throughout the United Kingdom, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Pollution generated by traffic is still an important factor in the developed countries, causing a fifth of the deaths, despite measures against the pollutants.
This caused only 5% of deaths worldwide, but the number could increase as many cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
Air pollution by the central, in particular by those operating with coal, has been significant at global level, causing one of seven deaths.
In the USA, it is the main single factor, causing a third of the 55,000 deaths annually, compared with 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air pollution, especially in arid and dusty regions, caused almost one fifth of deaths at global level due to air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some arid countries, accounting for 92% of the deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"The overlap between the high level of pollution and the large number of residents is saying the word about public health, but nothing else about the sources of pollution responsible for premature deaths," Jerrett says.
The results are surprising and potentially important for the protection of public health at global level.
It is now assumed that all particles are as toxic as they are.
But if fuel burning is more toxic, as some scientists believe, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be smaller.
Even so, Jerrett states, "the discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not generally been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and suggests that much more attention should be given to agricultural sources, both by science and political leaders."
Dr. Oliver Wild, an atmosphere specialist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, said: “The study itself underlines the need for air quality control to avoid these deaths, especially in the very populated areas of Asia. ”
Victor Ponta's statement tensions and more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop lying, the Roman Prime Minister speaks of attitudes that bring to mind Naziism
Relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement on the construction of a border guard with Romania, after the Saturday border, have experienced a new depreciation following the statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who accused the Budapest authorities of dealing with refugees "with battle and insemination".
Hungary's diplomacy has reacted hard speaking about the statements "extremists and liars", but Victor Ponta has not been harmed any more and has accused government officials in the neighbouring country of being "a Russian" for Europe.
Notably, it is not for the first time when Ponta is trying to stress Romano-ungal relations by statements made at delicate times or with an electoral character.
It all started with a statement made by Victor Ponta on Monday, in which he tried to argue that Romania could not receive more than 1,800 refugees.
Your problem with our logistics ability to treat those people like some people, not how they treat our neighbors, with boats and inseries.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu has put himself in the face of an ugly and horrible feeling that exists in all societies, namely a xenophobic feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but it's up to us to solve the problem.
"We're going to treat those people like us," said Victor Ponta, quoted on Monday.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta referred to when he spoke about the inclusion of refugees, but Czechia was recently in the centre of criticism after writing numbers on the hands of migrants found in several trains, in a gesture that remembered the procedure used by Nazis to identify Jewish prisoners from concentration camps.
Peter Szijarto appreciated, according to the Hungarian news agency MTI, taken by magyaridok.hu, that perhaps internal political crises that have shaken Victor Ponta's position make him the "extremist and liar" statement.
The company with Roman business from Budapest was called to provide explanations, mediafax reports, quoting MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inadequate statements about how Hungary manages the immigration crisis," the Hungarian Foreign Ministry states.
Levente Magyar, State Secretary for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in the Hungarian MAE, expressed "surpassion" in connection with "the constant attempts of Victor Ponta to save his controversial moral position through anti-governing lies", stresses Budapest's diplomacy.
"I don't want to respond to the challenges that come from the Hungarian government - but you read the report below and you will understand the indignation that I feel, as a European citizen, against the mentality and attitudes that Europe saw only in the 1930s!!", Ponta wrote, on his Facebook account.
He argues that, like other European politicians, "the duty" has to draw attention and sanction "the constant behaviour of government officials at the highest level in Hungary" who are "a Russian for European Union culture and values" by "anti-Semitic attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"Sarma gimpata, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decisions with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the refugees fled!", accused Ponta, claiming that he believes in "solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values", and "what we see in Hungary in the last days is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!"
During the evening, Ponta was invited to Antenna 3, where the main subject was Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if the Hungarian military were to catch and shoot or kill some children or women, in a speech that made several references to Nazism.
In the dispute, President UDMR, Kelemen Hunor, who considers that the Roman authorities should not have a "sensual approach" in relation to Hungary's intention to build a border guard.
The UDMR leader states that it must be understood that this solution is not directed against Romania or the Roma people, he argues that the guard might even help our country to become an intense transit route by migrants who will reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to underline, to say, that we don't have to marry, take this whole thing as something against Romania and don't have to use it to worsen any relationship that's not very good among the two governments, because it's not the case.
I think any sentimental approach, visceral is wrong.
"We need to see the rational part, see why we have arrived here and we need to know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, Roman citizens, and it does not prevent the free movement between the two states within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
The West ignored in 2012 Russia's bid to introduce Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership
Russia has now proposed to introduce the President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, as part of a peace agreement, according to an official high-level involved at that time in the negotiations with the bridges closed between the West and the Russian Federation, The Guardian writes.
The former President of Finland and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Martti Ahtisaari, said that Western powers have not benefited from the proposal since.
Since 2012, tens of thousands of people have died and millions of others have been forced to flee the country, giving birth to the most serious refugee crisis since the end of World War II.
Ahtisaari held discussions with the representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (USA, the United Kingdom, France, the Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
It further stated that during the discussions, the Russian ambassador Vitaly Churchin offered a plan that included among others and the proposal addressed to Assad to give up power at a given time, after the beginning of the peace treaties between the regime and the opposition.
It proposed three things:
One - we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we need to start a dialogue between Assad and the opposition immediately.
"Three - we need to look for an elegant way to assad withdraw," Ahtisaari said, referring to the position of the Russian ambassador.
He also said that Ahtisaari, the United States, the United Kingdom and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator was going to sit down, although they ignored the Russian ambassador's proposal.
"It was a lost opportunity in 2012", Finland's former president continued.
Russia has officially supported Bashar al-Assad throughout the four and a half years of war, insisting that its induction cannot represent a proposal in any peace agreement.
Assad believes that Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow has recently begun sending troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria, in an effort to stabilize Assad's regime and to confront the extremists of the Islamic State.
Antenna 3 live program will be available at cost
Antenna 3 informed her Tuesday, the viewers as from 1 November the program or live will be able to be viewed online against cost, based on a monthly subscription.
In a "record to viewers", the post of the Intact Trust says that "we do this with a strange heart, wanting to stay close to us and in this new stage, imposed by the conditions of the market".
According to the same message, the subscription will be 1 euro per month "for those of you who follow us online", television promising that the viewing will be of a very good quality.
Antenna 3 argues that "all these broadcasts live in the country and abroad, campaigns, daily news have been and are possible through a constant financial effort, assumed, which has assumed a permanent retrieval and focus on quality".
We managed to support ourselves alone, provided that offline and online distributors did not contribute with anything for the continued offer.
The announcement comes under conditions where the television program is accessible on the basis of subscription and online Antena Play platform, where, otherwise, the most frequently accessible exclusively and the registrations of Antenne's broadcasts.
The reports show that the population of marine animals and plants has increased over the last 40 years.
The scale of the crisis facing marine animals and plants is documented in detail in a study that states that marine species from all over the world, including the essentials for human food security, are in a decline that can be catastrophic.
Unprecedented pressures from several directions at the level of the global ocean ecosystem combine and create an age of difficulties for almost all marine life, says the WWF's report "The Blue Planet".
Coral reefs are subject to serious risk of decline (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and sea herbs, which depend on many other species, have recorded a significant decline, while all fish populations with commercial value, such as macro and tuna, have decreased verginos with three spheres compared to 1970s, the report shows.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical forests of the oceans due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction up to half this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to deteriorate, resulting in increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, resulting in a direct increase in the level of carbon dioxide in the sea.
"Healthful mothers are a source of extraordinary beauty and natural admiration and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, the chief marine policy adviser at WWF-UK, who contributed to the report's launch.
"With overfishing, which depletes coastal habitats, and without solving the problem of global warming, we look like seeds of an ecological economic catastrophe," said Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of the published scientific literature, but also on the indexes of the living planet, a database maintained by the London Zoological Society, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It has researched a great variety of marine species, fish, fry sea turtles and sea turtles - an animal like a worm, with fresh skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that the hungry areas decreased by approximately 30% in the last century, while the total mangrove areas decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of cod fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
During a single generation, human activity has caused huge damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their banks.
Deep changes are needed to ensure an abundant ocean life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, Director General of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have been recorded in fish species for commercial profits.
For example, 58 populations of 17 species belonging to the Scrombide family - macrou, tone and sardine - have decreased by 74% between 1970 and 2010, without any sign of recovery, says the report.
We're in a fishing race that could end up protecting people from a vital food source and an essential economic engine.
The overfishing, the destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and the poor communities, based on the sea, will be hit the fastest and most powerful," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and could undermine our struggle to eradicate poverty and undernutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, ZL’s scientific director, said: “These alarming figures show how fast people change the plants and animals of the oceans and are a clear warning about the problems we could face as a result.”
Sea grass: "peaks" extended by the sea, which captures the rich sediments into minerals and stabilizes the sea bottom.
Over the last century, the surface has decreased by 30%.
Mangrove: their existence is known in 123 countries, almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Almost 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most productive habitats on earth.
A quarter of all marine species live in coral reefs or near them, but three quarters of them are currently threatened and many can disappear during this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to sink.
Deep habitats: very little is known about the deepest areas of the ocean, but the decline in the number of fish caught in these inaccessible locations over the last 40 years suggests that they are also affected by marine changes at a global level.
Steven Gerrard denies the charges of racism that would have been brought to him by his former Liverpool teammate, El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage from his autobiography in "My Story", serialized by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticizes the Senegalese player saying that "he is not really interested in football" and that he is the colleague who liked "the least" in the 17 years he spent at the club.
As a response, Diouf would have responded to Gerrard on the Senegalese radio station Groupe Futurs Media, with quotes translated to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerrard never liked the color people".
Gerrard's lawyers have denied any charge of racism brought to him.
In his most recent book, Gerrard, who made himself more public and before his bad opinion about Diouf, criticized the attitude and degree of professionalism of his former colleague.
"I don't want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his irony seasons in Liverpool as an example of how things can go on the double," he writes.
"It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and that he doesn't care about Liverpool at all," he continued.
For example, the way in which he squeezed a huge and squeaky flag in a Celtic fan in a game by Cupa Uefa from Parkhead in March 2003 is an evidence of his distasteful and ranchiunous behavior.
Diouf proved himself a controversial figure all the time spent on Anfield, his most famous night being that of Celtic Park.
The former Senegalese was interrogated by police after the shooting episode and was fined with the countervaluation of his salary on two weeks at the club, the amount of 60,000 pounds being given to a humanitarian organization at the Celtic election.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as lazy and selfish.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard then wrote.
I felt that he wasn't ready to make every effort to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who now plays at the Sabah Malaysian club, criticized him, in his turn, in public Gerrard and attacked the old friend and teammate of Gerrard, Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerrard "self-esteem" and claimed that no one in Anfield liked the player who led the team to win the League of Champions in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is "green".
He said: “Gerrd is just jealous of me.
He didn't touch the results I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the chief's status, and he lives there.
I'm respected in the football world, the biggest football experts have framed me between the first seven players at the World Championship and the first 100 players of the century.
Many big players don't have a feeling of belonging.
Wherever I go, I'm poisoned, while Gerrard is hated every time he leaves his hometown Liverpool.
From the hero to the professional dancer: the fast road of Alek Scarlatos to "Dancing With the Stars"
In this season of "Dancing With the Stars", Alek Scarlatos does not only play the role of hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic guy, equally discreet and modern, says producers.
"There are many categories and we always look for the most popular of the time," said Deena Katz, an executive co-producer of the ABC show.
I swear he'll find his fingerprint after that.
It's charming.
He's got something special.
Before he competed at the famous show - but only a few weeks before - Scarlatos reached the international press after he took a stand in the face of a great danger.
He and his two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, immobilized a man armed with an AK-47 in a train full of travelers from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what could have been a mass murder by a possible terrorist.
After that, Scarlatos, a 22-year-old Sanitary in the National Army, who grew up near Sacramento, received a phone call from President Obama, a message on Twitter from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although it may anticipate some local appreciations - Friday, in Sacramento, there was a parade in the young age - there was not expected to be so many positive reactions or the invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
"Not in a million years would I have thought I'd get this offer," Scarlatos testified on Saturday, at a dance break with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything seems new and crazy.
Even though before the show of the moon he admitted that he was "lightly excited", he managed as a professional at his first Foxtrot, getting scores that brought him almost to the front of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said he offered one of the best performances of the series.
Katz and the executive producer from "DWTS" Rob Wade said they want to keep a free place in the show for competitors invited in the last hundred meters, as is the case with Scarlatos, who grew up in the audience.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends who were on vacation, who had launched a gun attack on a 500-passenger train and immediately thought of inviting one of them to the dance competition.
He searched the social networks, found the family members and sent messages to Scarlatos.
When he appeared at "Good Morning America" to tell the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the ABC daily program to avoid passing through all media bars.
And he supported the five-minute plenary, and then he looked forward to finding out if Scarlatos would agree to participate in the DWTS.
"For a while everything was very uncertain, because that's so different from what he does," Katz testified.
A little while ago, he fought in Afghanistan, and now I'm asking him if he has a dance chief.
Scarlatos, which is in a short season from the National Guard, was not even seeing a whole show until soon.
He hesitated to participate, mainly because he didn't want to be just the one who put it on record.
The show couldn't invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ass in their hand: Noah Galloway, a war veteran, with their hands and feet amputated.
They encouraged Scarlatos to call Galloway, the favorite fan and finalist of the past season, and to ask him about his experience.
That was probably the critical point, along with Katz's unstoppable "whispering" and "absorbing messages," she said.
"Noah is a great guy and I wanted to know how the army will be seen and how the image of my friends will be protected," Scarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So, after that conversation, I accepted.
Scarlatos, a great sports and history lover, never danced until then, and Arnold testified in interviews that he was trying to make him relax and give up military position pretty hard.
But Katz says it is reassuring that it will adapt and that spectators will react positively.
He will receive much love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and of what he has done.
"Why don't you stop him?" said Katz.
But this will only take a few weeks.
To go further, he has to dance.
Scarlatos, who is a bully and wants to become a cop, says that, so far, he's had fun in this completely unknown environment to him.
The program represented the worst struggle, and it had to travel frequently to Los Angeles between the times when it was announced in the media and the various premieres.
He said at the end of August, when he returned to the U.S. immediately after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with his family.
"It lasted about a day and a half," he said.
In total, I stayed home for four days.
There is a risk of a person attracting media attention, but it is not usual to be in the light of reflectors, executive producer Wade said.
And the issue wants to ensure that the competitor is able and entertaining.
"The pressure is great and we want participants to have a pleasant experience," Wade said.
"I don't want Alek to ever say, "Aoleu, what did I put in?"
Let's keep his fingers to the fun.
McDonald's McRib comes back.
The time has come for those who wait all year for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-coast to enjoy.
But is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of the French McDonald's in the country offers this season specialty.
Last year, 75% of the restaurants served McRib sandwich.
"The McRib 2015 promotion participates about 8,000 restaurants," said McDonald's spokesman Lisa McComb, for The Times in an e-mail.
In the US there are little more than 14 300 restaurants of this fast-food.
However, according to McComb, individual French owners decide whether or not to serve Mcrib.
"Participation is not significantly different from last year," McComb says.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu they think their local clients want.
And if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain the ingredients last year, with a video to show the reality.
According to the video, McRib sandwich is prepared from pig meat, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year, at McDonald's participating restaurants.
There is also a website with locations where McRib (unaffiliated at McDonald's), which can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can search the nearest place where this sandwich is served.
However, a quick search on the site shows that the closest restaurant with McRib of Los Angeles is in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.
Sometimes I just can't fight with the BBQ pizza pot.
Keith Richards makes sense that new Rolling Stones recordings would be prepared
Keith Richards is again in the light of the reflections with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon, and other members of the Rolling Stones group could join him in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others from Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - have recently met in London and made "clear plans for recordings", as he says.
Tuesday night, Richards spoke in the ICONS series from iHeartRadio to reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the first LP of the band after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the band wasn't inactive at all.
In recent years they have had many tournaments on stadiums and played in several small concerts in L.A., including representatives of Echoplex and Fonda Theatre.
In the last of these, they reinterpreted the 1971 classic LP, Sticky Fingers.
In particular, Richards was busy this year, working with the documentary "Keith Richards: Under the Influence", scheduled to be launched on 18 September on Netflix.
This year, he released the solo album "Crosseyed Heart", his third solo in a five-year career.
Randy Lewis of The Times described Richards' new album in a previous interview with the guitarist: "In all cases, Richards's voice is a kinder instrument than distinct..."
But Richards gets excited in all the 15 songs of the album and that always meant, in fact, the rock 'n' roll.
In the interview, Richards says the team will most likely enter the studio after the South American tournament from the beginning of next year.
He didn't give any other details, but, judging after the last concerts, the band is still very full of life.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman about childhood, maturity and "The Family Fang"
Jason Bateman has already gone through a few difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet pharmacist who made them look much simpler than they actually were.
Sometimes a child actor in television shows such as Silver Spoons, as an adult, has reaffirmed his role as an expressive typical in the television series "The Situation of Crisis" and in films such as "The Chief of the Cosmar".
The first film he worked as director was the very acid comedy "Bad Words", in which he played.
The film was nominated at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2013.
Bateman came back to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, an ambitious tonal film, adapting the 2011 Kevin Wilson's popular novel. The script is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and in the film Nicole Kidman and Bateman, in the role of brothers with problems.
The film is about a festival looking for American distribution.
Many reviews of the book have considered it a comedy with strong emotional tentes; the film reinterprets the story, focusing more on its dramatic, darker side.
In an interview with our publication on Tuesday, Bateman says he has always considered the book more a drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen a book like this," he testified.
In the book, the subject and the topics are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was dealing with a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and eccentricity.
The World Prize for the Months has benefited from an introduction by the festival's programme director Kerri Craddock, who expressed his particular enthusiasm for the "The Hogan Family" site from the late 1980s and early 1990s, at which Bateman worked. "I didn't meet too many fans "Hogan Family", Bateman said when he went to the scene.
However, the few episodes he ran from that site brought Bateman, now 46 years old, to Directors Guild at the age of 18.
His new film story has a family called Fang downtown.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their performances, for example by putting in place a bank robbery with academies or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At maturity, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) strive to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with some fame, though she is better known for public scandals than for performance, and Baxter is a novelist and magazine journalist who tries to get famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear in mysterious circumstances, Annie and Baxter assume it's just another trick of theirs and try to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what's going on in the story of children who want to evolve into adult life is reflected directly and deeply in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very atypical," Bateman confesses.
I started acting when I was 10 years old, with parents like managers, and this movie has many elements that overlap with the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as a superficial and fun.
"It's a story that I feel connected and understood in depth," he added, "and although I didn't try to add my personal experience to it, I knew very clearly how to show this film to represent children with a non-traditional childhood."
The project started with Kidman, and she's the producer of the film, who got the rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write his own adaptation, Lindsay-Abaire was co-opted, who adapted his own play "Treat to reality", where Kidman played.
Bateman testifies that he accepted the chance to direct the film and played in it.
(Kidman, currently on stage in London in the production of "Photograph 51", did not participate in the first month.
The author of the book was found in the public.)
In the Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney named Bateman's film "a smart and caustic adaptation" which "gives with the ink of the kind much exploited by the dysfunctional family and tells the mission, sometimes of a life, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be fun and sweet, incisive and usually very dark".
In Variety, Justin Chang named the film "a very sharp portrait" and mentioned that Bateman "proves visible progress and a greater maturity as film director with this structured intelligent adaptation, but never too narrow or mechanical".
After the month projection, when Bateman and Walken entered the scene for the question session, the audience ovated the multi-faceted Walken.
About Bateman as director and actor, Walker said during the question session that "I was impressed every day.
I didn't come to believe the ease with which he changed the work of film director, which is very difficult, and the actor in the scene.
His concentration is really amazing.
In a certain dialogue scene, Bateman stands on a ladder in the family house behind the frame, hidden in the bosom, only a shadow of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and is more clear.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman the actor talking to Bateman about the fact that he can't be seen.
"It seems incredible to me to drive movies," Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, I never take them to benefit me as an actor.
Having a privileged position to be responsible for creating the entire public experience, not just one instrument in that orchestra, being an actor, is a complete thing.
No matter what, that... actor wants a first-plan.
During the question and answers session, Bateman testified that after reading the script, he immediately thought about Walken for the role of Caleb, but also about Carter Burwell for the sound column.
Especially known for long friendship with the Coen brothers, Burwell has composed the sound column for two other films present at the festival of Toronto: the animation "Anomalisa" - a story about love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Legal Gangsters", by Brian Helgeland, about the English gangster twins of the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell also composed the sound column for Todd Haynes's "Carol" film.
"Lucks with long tones or obtuses seem very interesting to me," Bateman says, giving more explanations Tuesday.
To navigate through those tones and guide the harmonious audience and somehow elegant from one tone to the next, during the film.
Carter built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate among the most complicated tones.
With "The Family Fang", Bateman took another bold step, both director and actor, in a career dominated by reinventing and deciding, a mix of comedy and drama, light and dark.
As Bateman testified when he finished his film introduction to the world premiere of the months, "Well, unfortunately, it came out exactly as I wanted."
The festival means that the Oscars about the Boston Globe investigation about the Pedophile priests
Did you win $240,000 at the lot?
A ticket to X-LOTTO worth over $240,000 is unclaimed for a month.
The unregistered ticket at the X-Lotto extraction was purchased from the English Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd on Saturday 15 August.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, another 16 winning entries have been registered throughout Australia, which have shared their only estimated 4 million-dollar X-Lotto first fund.
SA Lotteries asks all those who bought tickets to X-Lotto from England Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the extraction of X-Lotto 3555 on Saturday, 15 August, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, the English Farm Lotteries Kiosk manager, says he looks forward to receiving the good news that the one who won the big prize checked his ticket to X-Lotto.
"We've tried to spread the news from the cracks, because a person is our winner and doesn't have the worst idea," she said.
Criminal detectives are searching the house on Beadell Street, Burton, where the man who disappeared Daniel Hind was last seen
Hind's sister, Chelsea Hind, said it's frustrating to wait for information about her missing brother, especially because the police offered two different versions of his trip the night he was last seen.
Her family was asked by the police to search for her home ever since her brother disappeared.
"I was hoping they'd search the house, I wasn't told they'd do it," she said.
Ms. Hind says that her family also wanted those who knew what was going on with her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four children and we have many other family members and half of us think he's alive somewhere, and the other half think he's not.
Anyway, we want him home and end the story.
By 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometres of highway
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 kilometres of new highways and repair 17,000 kilometres of existing main and secondary axles.
The completion of the work for Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina motorways, all of which are part of pan-European transport corridors, are among the priorities of the road infrastructure development plan approved Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable rail infrastructure in Bulgaria and to integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure increased safety on the axles and efficient road transport management, the government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for the traffic of cultural goods in Syria
According to Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for the illicit trafficking of stolen cultural goods in the Middle East, due to its geographical location.
During a speech held on Wednesday at a conference on the fight against the plundering of Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation was renewed to fit the new context, stressing the ban on cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of the Interior, in particular the Directorate-General for the "Fighting of Organized Crime" (GDBOP) have focused on preventing the smuggling and illegal sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.
He stated that Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, which recent studies have placed on the third place, after Italy and Greece, in the top of the traffic in cultural goods and objects.
Bulgaria's internal minister has also shown that the trafficking of cultural objects and the destruction of historical sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria is a phenomenon that has taken on a large scale, being described as an extremely serious war crime.
He stressed the need for concerted and decisive measures to stop the deliberate destruction of history.
Director General UNESCO, Irina Bokova, mentioned that the filming of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria demonstrates that the country is affected by industrial robbery.
Participants to the Wednesday conference acknowledged that Syria's cultural heritage is seriously endangered and that the international community must unite to stop the illegal trafficking of cultural goods in the war-damaged country.
Rocketdyne says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified
On Tuesday, Rocketyne Holdings Inc Aerojet announced that it is expected to complete the new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a Russian engine that will be banned soon, but the date could be changed if it does not receive enough funds from the US government.
Aerojet Vice President, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to make statements about that Aerojet offered $2 billion to buy United Launch Alliance (ULA), a mixed company with equal shares for Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co missile launches.
Analysts say the proposed amount is a strategic move of the Aerojet to win the Blue Origin rival, a company owned by the Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, who develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan rocket.
ULA says the Blue Origin engine program is about two years before the AR-1 engine at Aerojet, an assertion that Aerojet is a contrast.
The new engines have become a priority after US legislators have approved a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for the launch of American military or spy satellites, following the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck claims that the Aerojet test equipment hardware for the engine, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to fit both the Atlas 5 of the ULA rocket, now powered by the RD-180 engine, and the new Vulcan rocket that develops the ULA and costs about $1 billion.
The aircraft says it will be less expensive and less risky to integrate its engine into Atlas 5 rocket than to develop a completely new engine and rocket, as the ULA is currently planning.
Van Kleeck says the Aerojet was planning to start testing engines on a wide scale in 2017, followed by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be delayed if the company does not receive sufficient funds from the Air Force in contracts expected at the end of the first half of the fiscal year 2016, which starts in October.
It further claims that the whole company was impatient to see how the Air Force will share a funding of approximately USD 160 million between rival competitors.
It also says that Aerojet was planning to try other private financing options for the engine, but did not offer details.
Competition from the Air Force is a public-private partnership and each of the bidders must provide a third of the funding, and the Air Force covers two thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies (Space Exploration Technologies), or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both of which are private companies, have self-financed the engine creation process and say that it does not necessarily seek government funding.
AB InBev beer company intends a 275 billion-dollar merger with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the world's largest beer producer company, approached the rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) about a takeover that would form a colossus that would produce a third of the world's total amount of beer.
Such a merger would have a market value of about 275 billion dollars at current prices and would combine AB InBev's domination in Latin America with SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with rapid development, but also with their beer factories in Asia.
"The true attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also some places in Asia and Latin America," analyst Andrew Holland from the General Society said.
AB InBev and other top beer companies are trying to enter new markets and strengthen their weak spots in North America and Europe, where consumers are increasingly preferring beer produced by independent players or wine or spirits.
SABMiller, a company located on the second world market and the producer of over 200 beer brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said Wednesday that it was informed by AB InBev to make an offer to him, which must happen by 14 October, in accordance with British law.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund managed by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, renowned for its policy of reducing the costs of the marketing sock, has previously orchestrated the acquisition of Burger King, the ketchup Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
An appropriate source of SAB mentioned that it is too early to say what it will do, as they have not received any offer.
"At this point, we are in the phase we are waiting and deciding," the source said.
The speculation of a merger, which is very likely to raise concerns about the infringement of competition rules on markets such as the United States and China, has been circulating for several years.
The time to approach, after a better decade of purchases by AB InBev, is followed by a decrease of about 15% of SABMiller's share price from August.
"It's exactly the moment they were expecting," said analyst Phil Gorham from Morningstar.
Financially, for the first time in many years, it has logic.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds (62 USD) for action SAB Miller, perhaps even 45 pounds, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to USD 130 billion, which would also include the SABMiller debt.
This would make the most significant M&A transaction in 2015, which is already a record year after the financial crisis in 2008 from the point of view of the transaction, and one of the largest acquisitions in 1980 here.
SAB's shares amounted to 19.9% to 36.14 pounds, giving it a stock exchange capitalisation of $90 billion.
AB InBev shares reached 6.4%.
Rivali Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that SAB could seek another merger as defence strategies, as it happened in the previous year when he offered to buy Heineken, but failed.
Since then, he has combined the African bottler with the Coca-Cola (KO.N), and in recent weeks there has been a ban on a combination with Diageo or with Australian Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX) drinks firm.
The global market share of AB InBev, Budweiser producer, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1% in 2014 while SABMiller was 15%, according to Plato Logic industry experts.
AB InBev intends to report between net debt and gross profit (EBITDA) of 2 times, from 2.5 of the present.
It is possible to achieve the objective in 2016, the closest realistic date to which the transaction could be concluded, so that it would have a way to borrow to finance a purchase.
When he bought Budweiser's company, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with USD 52 billion, the largest purchase of ice money in history at that time. He let the report grow more than 5 times.
A rise like that would allow him to collect a debt of 100 billion.
The families that control AB InBev hold less than half of the company, while the two main shareholders from SABMiller are the tobacco producer Altria (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
On Wednesday, Altria refused to make statements about the fact that AB InBev had been approached, but on 9 September, its financial director, Billy Gifford, said in an analysis conference that he regularly assesses the investment in SABMiller and that "this time we consider the maintenance of assets to be in the interest of our shareholders".
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, head of European Investments, failure, at Alliance Global Investors, which holds shares in both companies, says AB InBev faced an increasing pressure to return the surplus to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of small debt revenues reaches about 15% somewhere.
But we believe that the profit obtained from this acquisition would be a disappointing percentage of 8% after 10 years," Dwane said.
In the case of any combination, there are significant burdens related to the infringement of competition rules, in particular in the United States, where companies hold around 70% of the beer market.
"Economys that could be done in distribution operations are large, and the issues related to the violation of competition rules are even greater," said Erik Gordon, professor at the Ross Business School at the University of Michigan.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Cors to obtain the 58 per cent of the company's participation held by SABMiller, in accordance with the operating agreement governing it.
A change in control at SABMiller would automatically grant Molson the right to get another 8 percent and appoint a new executive director of the company.
Molson, based in Denver, would have the right to the first and last bids for the rest of 50 percent.
One Molson speaker refused to comment on whether the company was interested in an invitation to tender, but the Molson shares increased by more than 12 percent, at their highest value.
Any merger could also have to sell shares in China, where market leader is the association in the participation of CR Snow of SABMiller with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao from China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that, after injection, the combined group could hold 28% of the global market.
AB InBev is advised by Lazard, and SABMiller is advised by Robey Warsaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistani police accuse a former Air Force pilot of helping Qaeda
The Pakistani police arrested a former Air Force pilot who would have provided further funds to Taliban and Al Qaeda, said Wednesday police officers for Reuters, in a rare case that targets those who support financial activism.
Suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern city of Karachi.
It paid for the treatment of wounded Taliban militants at a hospital in eastern Lahore, the police said.
He also influenced two militants involved in another month's attack on a bus with members of the Muslim minority and Ismaelian, after which 45 people died, declared to journalists the senior police officer Naveed Khawaja from the Department for Combating Terrorism in the province.
It will be charged with financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has further funded the Afghan Taliban, we are still conducting research to see if he has provided financial assistance through his business or behind him," the officer said.
"Ahmed also offered financial assistance to AQIS," said, referring to the Al Qaeda organization on the Indian subcontinent, a branch of Al Qaeda founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces, which confronts activism, corruption and crime.
After, in December, the Taliban rifles massacred about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school, the government swore to undermine activism.
There have been severe attacks, while the army has also advanced, and more in tribal regions outside the border with Afghanistan.
However, the militant groups remain a threat and many are suffering from Pakistani cities under the control of very poorly prepared police forces and with insufficient funds.
Ahmed, at the age of 52, used to preach at a mosque in a good area of the Karachi Army Location Authority.
His public sermons were moderate, but, in particular, he encouraged radicalism, the police said.
He studied at the Pakistani Air Force College in Sargodha and left Pakistani Air Force in 1998, another security officer for Reuters declared anonymous.
Later, he entered the chemical wax and substances industry.
Rapper Rick Ross rejected the application for copyright for "Everyday I'm a guestlin"
New York Rapper Rick Ross can't claim copyright for the words "Everyday I'm Hostlin'," decided an American judge, rejecting his complaint against the LMFAO musical group, who sold tricks with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm shufflen'".
In a decision published Tuesday by the Miami Federal Court, District Judge Kathleen Williams said Ross's slogan, a prominent part of his early hit from 2006, "Hustlin", is a short expression for which the courts have mentioned several times that he cannot receive copyright.
Williams’ judgment weakens the process of violating the copyright of Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, has tried against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the electrotropic duet of Los Angeles, located in Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin" for their famous 2010 song "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm shufflen".
The hip hop star said the LMFAO melody is "a clear attempt to capitalize the fame and success of the Hustlin melody".
He also tried Kia Motors to use the song "Party Rock Anthem" in a advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright by selling shirts and other products with the shufflen slogan.
In Tuesday's ruling, Williams says "Hustlin", as a melody, is protected by copyright law.
But Ross's three-word slogan is derived from the usual words and can't have copyright, she said.
The judge compared it to other famous verses in the past, such as "you get the right one, uh-huh", "holla back" and "we get it popin'", saying it is "a short expression, which all the courts unanimously declared it impossible to place under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether the song of the LMFAO band is an unauthorized copy of Hustlin.
The process is scheduled for October.
Ross and LMFAO's lawyers could not be contacted immediately for statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al, at the US District Court for Southern District, Florida, No.

Dr. Carson approaches Trump in the most recent presidential poll of the Republican Party
According to the most recent presidential poll for 2016, newsman Ben Carson approached the bomb leader Donald Trump in the preliminary republican elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush went down in seven-point polls.
Following the support of 27% of Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times, Carson, retired neurosurgeon, reaches second place with 23%, followed by Bush, by television star Mike Huckabee, Senator of Florida Marco Rubio, each with 6%.
The support of Republican voters in the preliminary elections increased from the beginning of August to the beginning of September for Trump, Carson, the governor of Ohio John Kasich and former executive director of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
The support for the last two remains, however, in numbers of one digit.
Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and leading the Bush family's standards, fell by seven percentage points in a month, while the governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker fell by eight points.
In the last survey, Walker's support is 2%.
Carson attracted greater support than Trump among college graduates (29% versus 21%), while Trump was ahead of Carson in the preferences of non-university voters (30% versus 19%).
Trump is supported by more men than women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents to the survey said they are determined what candidate to support in the preliminary elections in their state.
Those who said I know who they're going to vote with twice as much support Trump than Carson.
It's still too early to say for 63% of the Republican voters for the preliminary elections.
The results of the CBS/NYT survey conducted between 9 and 13 September will be made public on Tuesday, before a presidential debate in the Republic.
Carson's promotion in this survey reflects that of Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders in front of the leader for the nomination of Democrats to the presidential, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The latest follow-up to CBS presidential nominations shows that Sanders entered Iowa with 10 points and 22 points respectively in New Hampshire, among the pre-election democratic voters.
A leading ethics specialist says sexual robots should be banned
A leading ethics specialist in the robotics industry launched a campaign calling for the ban on the development of sexual robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, a robotic expert at the University of Montfort in Leicester, England, warns that sexual robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
"Sex robots seem to be an increasingly important subject in the robotics industry, and the models from which they are inspired - the way they will show, what roles they will have - are very disturbing," she told the BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sexual robots is not one against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
It's inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires technology development," she said for Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will contribute to increasing the degree of sexual exploitation.
Although sexual robots that are now being manufactured are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that they are the first step towards something worse.
It's a new and emerging technology, but we have to stop it from the face.
I'm sure the industry seems to have.
A few years ago, True Companion, a company producing flammable dolls, launched Roxxxy, the first sexual robot in the world.
However, concern about the potential dangers raised by artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among the major industry partners.
Even this spring, the executive director of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, wrote about “the risk that, in five years, something really dangerous happens.
In an interview with BBC last December, physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that "the development of complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race".
Britain's First Refugees in Syria - RT UK
In the following days, Britain will receive the first refugees who fled the Syrian war, Interior Minister Theresa May announced.
They will receive assistance under the government's extensive re-installation programme.
Asylum-seeking refugees arrive from camps on the border with the war-stricken country.
These are the first of the 20,000 refugees the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Interior Minister said the government "works fast" to ensure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom, it is imperative that the assistance and support they need and deserve are already being put in place.
I know that honourable Members and the general public want to find out more details about the number of persons and the date on which they are estimated to arrive.
May mentioned that the government must also make more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate provisions when they arrive.
I need to stress that the level of enlargement requires careful and metallic planning to ensure that everything is done properly.
Me and the Syrian refugee minister Richard Harrington, we will continue to keep the Chamber in this regard.
But I am pleased to say to the House that we expect to meet the first wave of refugees in the next few days and work quickly for planning more arrivals in the coming weeks.
Prime Minister David Cameron attracted the anger of parliamentarians and militants when he revealed the government's refugee plan, many thinking the figure was too small.
In September, Cameron said in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom "will rise to the highest moral responsibility" and receive 20,000 refugees from the Middle East camps to the next general elections.
He added that refugees would not automatically receive complete asylum, but a humanitarian status that would allow them to apply for asylum after five years.
But critics have noted that the figures meant only 12 refugees a day, and the former Liberal Democratic MP Paddy Ashdown said the measures were "desiring".
Further, Ashdown has revealed that children included in this scheme are to be deported when they are 18 years old if they do not receive asylum.
They also condemned important public figures and public figures.
In a common letter, great names such as Benedict Cumberbach, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said the answer to the crisis is "too little, too late".
"It is a responsibility that must be shared with our European neighbours, not just thrown on the shoulders of the countries close to the conflicts that take people away from their homes," they wrote.
Rubla goes back to the fund of global uncertainty - RT Business
The Russian rubla was strengthened on Wednesday, being traded with 65.66 against the US dollar and with 73.98 against the euro at the Moscow Stock Exchange at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency won seven percent from its lowest 71 rubles for a dollar on August 24th.
Analysts say that the return of the rubble occurred due to the investor's reaction to the current global market disturbances produced by Chinese weights, the possible increase in the US Federal Reserve's interest rate and the excessive reaction to cheap oil.
The Brent quotas increased on Wednesday with 61 cents, reaching 48.36 USD per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) has traded 72 cents more at 45.31 USD per barrel.
OTHER MULTS: Most likely, the interest rate will increase in the USA by the end of 2015 - US Fed
"Vulnerability is possible to say the word, fuelled by uncertainty about China and by the rise in the federal interest rate, which will continue to give the tone for oil and rubble prices," said Bloomberg Piotr Matys from Rabobank, expert in monetary policy strategies on emerging markets, established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the strengthening of the Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are linked to the US dollar, began to buy rubles.
Global markets are waiting with the soul at the mouth for the Federal Reserve's decision of Thursday, whether it will increase or not the interest rate.
Markets do not consider that what could be the first growth in the nine-year US interest rate and traded at higher rates on Wednesdays.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together on the drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the U.S. government and with companies such as Google, Amazon and the Verizon telephone company in developing a database that allows drone pilots to reserve airspace blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet been established at EU level.
Cooperation is the result of a very widespread non-linear approach to the possibility of an air collision between small drones and commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes the potential negative effect in live colours.
"Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies by delivering products or catching data in urban areas with high density, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco," the research mentioned.
Without a common set of technological protocols and air rules, chaos could be installed.
According to this O'Cathain, Baroness of the Lorzi Chamber, concern has grown on the background of the reports on events at the limit of production of an accident and the operation of drones over football stadiums, near nuclear power stations and the Eiffel Tower.
"Over the past two years, over 400 calls to the metropolitan police have been linked to drone incidents," O'Cathain said.
The solution is to build a system that follows all drones, especially those flying at a height of less than 150 metres, whether driven by commercial or amateur pilots.
"As many small drones operate commercial flights at low altitude, beyond the visibility level of the pilot, or even completely autonomous flights, there is a need for some air traffic management infrastructure to separate flights, in order to ensure the safety of complex operations, such as the delivery of parcels in the city," she said.
According to NASA, this drone traffic management system will include services such as air space design, methods to avoid unfavourable weather conditions and wind, congestion management, route planning and redirection through similar methods with rules for road traffic, such as signals and waves.
They are expected to have a functional prototype by 2019.
The drone industry is going to explode in the European Union over the next few years.
"We already see small and innovative SMEs in the United Kingdom using this technology with significant effects in the energy, agriculture and the media industries," says Lord Tariq.
Over 670 permits for commercial drone operations were granted only in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150 000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
Discile button: why Facebook wants to know what's in it for you
"A Look Back" works the same way, gathering the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will this mean for many users within the virtual Facebook borders, who are now more than the population of any country?
First of all, of course, a empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge value of Facebook - about 240 billion USD after the latest statistics - is due to the unimaginable amount of data about the consumers it holds.
Every interaction, postage, appreciation and friendship you make are gathered and build a remarkable image of complex, located in a permanent update, about your person and the preferences you have.
This is particularly valuable for advertising agencies, who can use all this information to choose carefully what people see on Facebook ads, selecting those who are most interested in their products.
A empathy button adds another set of data and, of course, opens a door for another type of advertising agent to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who "appreciate" a national football team, charitable organisations and promoters want to address those who, for example, "empathize" with the refugee crisis.
It will also probably change what you see in News.
Facebook uses incredibly intelligent and sophisticated algorithms to restrict that vast universe of content that you could see in the smaller stream that you actually see.
This algorithm depends essentially on what you considered interesting in the past and, above all, on what you liked.
There is no doubt that there are many interesting posts on Facebook, but unfortunates do not enter the algorithm, because people don't feel that they should be appreciated.
However, if Facebook understands more about what upsets you or makes you feel unhappy, it could decide to remove this kind of news item.
Facebook has conducted experiments in the past to understand how what you see in News affects your emotional state and, above all, how this is transmitted from one person to another.
The academic environment representatives call this "emotional contamination" and, although it sounds sinister, it is probably just a simple trial of Facebook (and published, with their agreement) to better understand the way their platform works and if they can adjust the algorithms to distribute more elements.
What's going to happen with the empathy button stays on Facebook.
The real thing is the way a single company decides to add a single button to its services can produce so much speculation.
The reason for this may be that the decisions made by Facebook - whether it involves the visible buttons that we see or the invisible algorithms that work hidden - have profound consequences on us today.
Now we spend a significant part of our life in the digital world, which we access to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and another that is leading a constant struggle for survival in the ferocious Darwinian world of social technology and networks.
The decisions you take, including with regard to new buttons, will be the most appropriate ones to remain on the ground in this course.
I think many people can empathize with this and soon they'll have a button for this.
Biometric phrases can anticipate crises in people with autism
In the course of ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team have established that the body signals can anticipate these changes, sometimes violent, before they occur, giving the assistants the opportunity to take the appropriate measures.
The autism kids we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say that it hurts his head or that "there's too much noise here" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body transmits, and it's necessary to do this in a mild and intrusive way.
For example, simple color visualization in an application can show the level of agitation. The red can be used to warn about a change of behavior, and blue for lack of interest, giving the assistant understanding that the person is tired and needs stimulation.
Broker data can be collected in time and saved on a secure server, helping caregivers to understand the overall picture of how the person responds to different situations and which would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to say very clearly that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magic. They need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with producers to further develop this technology, to be specific to autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, director of the services for customers from the Wirral Autistic Society, who will present technology at the Autech 2015 conference on autism and technology from Manchester on 1 October.
When you work with people who suffer from severe autism, as we do, you see the spectacular difference that can bring in the quality of their lives the assistance technology. Now, apps for iPad give, in their own, a voice of people who have never spoken.
The robots help the autistic kids learn to play to hide.
"Who knows where we could lead this innovation," she says.
Assistive technologies can really change life and we feel that they are part of our mission, as a charity for autism, to ensure that everyone has access to this information and they are also part of the discussion of how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria "in the coming weeks"
In the coming weeks, French warplanes will launch air attacks on the Isis targets in Syria, announced the government on Wednesday, just a few days after President François Hollande said the intervention was "necessary".
France will launch the first air attacks on the jihadist group Islamic State in Syria "in the coming weeks", Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday.
The French Air Force is conducting recognition missions in Syria from 8 September, and the attacks will follow "in the coming weeks, as soon as we have clearly identified targets," Le Drian told Radio Post France Inter.
Le Drian said in parliament Tuesday that the Islamic State made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the Nordic region of Aleppo.
"In the town of Mare there is an extremely powerful offensive, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what we still call the Syrian Free Army or the Syrian National Coalition or what remains of it," he said.
France is part of a U.S.-led coalition that for one year bombed the Isis positions in Iraq, but the Netherlands has changed the strategy last week to extend the actions in Syria, under the conditions in which political pressure accumulates on the jihadist threat fund facing France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf States have already been involved in attacks on the Isis militants in Syria.
Blocking feature of iOS 9 ads will make the phone even faster
The latest version of iOS 9 launches Wednesdays and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worrying for online editors - is the ability to easily block ads during web browsing.
The new feature will allow users to download third-party extensions that block cookies, advertisements, pop-up windows and other types of advertising while using the Safari mobile browser version from Apple.
At the test, it was proved that, after blocking the advertisements, news sites such as the New York Times are loaded twice as fast as Reuters.
The blocking of advertisements also helps users to preserve their use of data and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from multiple advertising blocking options, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular tool to block ads for desktop, launched its own iOS web browser that limits ads; its creator intends to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
People using advertising blocking software are faced with a number of constraints.
The ads are still displayed in applications (this is where Apple earns money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, try to prevent visitors from using such blocking features of the ads.
However, their level of use on desktop computers increased to almost 48% in the previous year.
Their development raises major challenges for online media, which is largely offered to consumers free of charge and is supported financially for many years through advertising.
One report says that blocking ads could cost online editors nearly 22 billion in advertising revenues only this year.
To enable blocking ads in iOS 9, users need to download an application for blocking ads, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to activate an extension for blocking content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the king of Spain
President Barack Obama happened to King Felipe VI of Spain on Tuesday at the White House, where the two discussed various subjects, but which were probably reduced to the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the kings have addressed the issue of the fight against the Islamic State and the growing crisis of immigrants in Europe - which is already facing hundreds of thousands of people who have left their country of origin to go west.
"Spain has worked very hard to deal with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous journeys, and the problems of human trafficking," Obama said.
Of course, the problem's gotten worse in the last few months.
Obama also stressed the importance of cooperation, especially in the context of the Spanish territory of Catalonia voting in elections to take place this month.
"As regards foreign policy, we have been firmly committed to maintaining relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
The Supreme Commander told King Felipe that he would like to visit the country before the end of his mandate in 2017.
"We welcome you with open arms," answered Felipe.
First lady, Michelle Obama, gave the queen a tour of the White House and had a tea talk.
That was the first visit of the royal couple in the United States of America from the throne.
After they left Washington, they were going to visit South Florida.

Members of the British royal family will participate in the world premiere of the movie "Spectre"
Prince Harry and Dukes and Dukes of Cambridge will take part next month in London in the world's first film with James Bond, "Spectre".
Kensington Palace announced Wednesday's news on Twitter, appointing the premiere as the Royal Film Performance for the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.
According to a press release by the producers, "Spectre" is the third Bond film selected as the 1946 RFP.
In the past, first kings have been selected and "Don't Die Today" (2002) and Casino Royale (2006).
This year's event takes place on 26 October. at the Royal Albert Hall in London and will be a charity that will benefit employees from the British film and television industry.
The first will also include actors from the film distribution, including the main actor Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomi Harris, David Bautista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.
The director Sam Mendes and the producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will also go on the red carpet next to the royal family.
"Spectre" will be broadcast in US cinematographs in November.
There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
The model Christie Brinkley and musician John Mellencamp were seen taking dinner together for months, ringing the bell that the two would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to have dinner at the Bowery Hotel in New York City, where the photos surprised Brinkley with joy and smile.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing blouses, tennis and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock star was dressed in broken blouses, pallets and boots.
Last year, in October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his girlfriend, whom he separates from and with whom he constantly cares, the actress Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp praised the message star for you at today's NBC show, saying it was "an angel sent to me and I am very happy".
He added that "nothing ends until it's over."
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook, photographed for the Seventeen magazine, walking along her mother's tracks.
The kings of arctic captives are large enough to catch a caribou
Many studies have highlighted species that have become more vulnerable because of the warmer climate, but global warming has proved to be a blessing to others.
One of these benefits is the Arctic porter.
According to researchers from the Dartmouth College, the warmest temperatures in the Arctic region have allowed the farmers here to appear earlier and grow bigger, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers from the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used field observations to illustrate the effects of temperature changes on Arctic settlements.
Their analysis anticipates an increase of 50% of the survival rate of adult prisoners in the condition of an increase of 2 degrees Celsius temperature.
The loans are small, but they are important members of the Arctic Tropical Chain and the ecosystem.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in Procedings of the Royal Society B - aims to help biology better anticipate how a growing population could affect the caribou with which they feed, the birds and insects that feed with them and the plants that they pollinate.
In order to build their demonstration, scientists from Dartmouth combined the results from the field with the laboratory experiments that investigated how the temperature influences the development of the insect and the predictability of being hunted by predators.
Although the increase in temperature makes the larger prisoners more vulnerable to collapses, it also offers them a early start in spring and makes the development of their larvae faster and more efficient, which certainly represents an advantage.
Several countries mean a larger population, which can only be developed to the extent that they can support insect food sources.
The ability of citizens to transform their improved survival rate into an improved reproductive rate depends on their ability to provide their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies show that the administration of antidepressants to pregnant women has no effect on the development of their children's neuronal or behavioral development.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin recuperation inhibitors (SSRIs) present an increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have said that depression is a greater risk for women and children, which is why it is necessary to be treated.
"These studies add an increasing set of evidence on the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy," said John Thorp, the deputy editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, the evidence so far seems to show that the risks of untreated depression are greater than those raised by the administration of antidepressants.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on the development of the motor of children whose mothers were treated with SSRI, analysing the data of 51,404 children in the Norwegian mother and child cohort study, investigating the effects of the use of SSRI for the development of engine capacity at the age of 3.
Researchers found that 381 mothers used SSRI during pregnancy, and 159 of them treated drugs for a long period of time.
Although exposure to SSRI was associated to some extent with a delay in engine development, researchers wrote in the study that the association "was not as significant as granting delays a clinical significance".
A group of researchers from Adelaide University of Australia conducted a data examination for 49,000 Danish births Court women to discover the effects of SSRI administration on the behaviour of children up to the age of 7.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems.
In 210 children whose mothers were treated with SSRI depression, there was no increased risk of behavioural problems compared to 231 children who were more predisposed to behavioral problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and socialization.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more predisposed to blood after birth if treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30 198 who were born at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal bleeding increased by 5%, between 11-16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe bleeding or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers reported.
Researchers said that although the study has linked the administration of SSRI with increased risk, there are a large number of variables - from medications taken during birth to limited amount of information received by researchers on the specific medical conditions of women - that could have had an effect on the potential for bleeding.
"It is possible that women who have taken antidepressants at an advanced stage of the task were those with the most serious stage of the disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal, not antidepressants," says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, professor at Adelaide University.
On the basis of this study, we do not recommend that women stop treating medications during pregnancy, but should be closely monitored to minimise the risk of potential bleeding.
Matthew is charged with murder in the case of the murder of a student at the Virginia Technical University.
The man accused of killing a student Hannah Graham at the University of Virginia has been charged with a qualified murder in the case of a student at the University of Virginia who disappeared in 2009, the authorities announced Tuesday.
The great jury in Albemarle, Virginia, accused Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. on Friday at the age of 33 from Charlottesville for the murder of Morgan Harrington, I say to the officials.
Matthew is also accused of kidnapping with the intention of rape.
Each accused head receives the maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
Harrington, 20 years old, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say the news of the charges brought them relief.
"For six years we have been working determined and unbundled for this purpose," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.
I'm glad to know that when you take someone's life, you have to bear the consequences for what you do.
For Jesse Matthew, the domino parts of the consequences began to be sitting.
The police say there is a legal link between Harrington, Graham and a sexual abuse of Fairfax County in 2005.
In June, Matthew was found guilty of it and waited for the feeling in this case.
He stays in prison in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew charged with murder in the case of the death of a student at the University of Virginia
Harrington went to U-Va. on October 17th. 2009, along with friends, to a Metallica concert.
The group separated when Harrington left John Paul Jones Arena from Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't get back in.
Last time she was seen trying to take a taxi around 8:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was wearing a black shirt with Pantera.
After her disappearance, Harrington's luggage and mobile phone were found in the arena parking lot.
The family and friends began an extensive search for Harrington, a graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a teacher. Metallica people wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the shirt she wore was found next to a number of apartments in Charlottesville.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated chain, in a farm south-west of Charlottesville.
In the period of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it's not clear if that period was over when Harrington disappeared.
Police say a significant advance in the Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the event of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said these cases were linked by DNA evidence.
The investigators did not immediately disclose the details of the new evidence that led to Matthew's being charged with the murder of Harrington.
The defense lawyer, Douglas Ramseur, who represents Matthew in Graham's case, refused to make statements.
The announcement of the prosecution comes two days after the completion of a year from Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to Harrington's case: both were young students who disappeared when they left town in Charlottesville.
Graham, aged 18, from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a mall in the center near the U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later, after a national search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be judged for a qualified murder in Graham's case.
In the first days after Graham's disappearance last fall in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at meetings and views organised for the missing student from U-Va.
Harrington says he endured speculation and criticism for her daughter in the media that must be reduced to silence by new charges against Matthew.
"In all this time, there have been discussions of the kind "Why was the short hole?" and "And look for it with the candle?" but this kind of questions and judgment are not valid when it is clear that we have to deal with a predator on the trails of the hunt," Harrington added.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was convicted of sexual assault against a youth in 2005.
The woman, who was 26 at the time of the attack, told the jury that, on a September night, while she was returning home from the store, a stranger came behind her.
She took her to a veritable area, beat her and strung her throat, and then attacked her sexually.
"I thought the end had come to me, that I had to shout constantly," the woman testified.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew took her away quickly, the woman said.
A prosecutor told the jury that Matthew might have been scared of the lights of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was sentenced years later, after DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew will get the feeling in October.
Matthew will come to trial for the first time in the Harrington case in Charlottesville on Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said the most likely will come Wednesday in Charlottesville and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
"At least, today we've taken a step," says Dan Harrington.

Good news for Romania from the European Commission
The European Commission decided on Tuesday to resume payments for Romania in the framework of the "Economic Competitiveness" and "Media" programmes, both interrupted at the beginning of April 2015.
According to a statement by the representative of Romania of the European Commission, following this decision, about 120 million euros will be transferred to the Roman authorities in the next period immediately.
I am glad to announce the closure of these payments and I appreciate the efforts made by the Roman authorities to improve management and control systems within the two programmes.
It is important that the Roman authorities have been involved in identifying weak points and solving problems.
"I hope that the measures taken will significantly reduce the risk of errors and irregularities in the future," said European Commissioner for Regional Policy Corina Cretu.
"The extremist statements made by Mr. Gianni Pitella are incorrect," Hungarian diplomat chief responded.
Peter Szijarto asked European socialists to stop "the campaign of lies" at the address of Hungary.

Refugee crisis: YES without any solution
European Council President Donald Tusk announced that Thursday will take a decision on the possible convening of a European Union summit on migration in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the counterpart or Austrian Werner Faymann asked Tuesday to organize a European Union summit to resolve the refugee crisis.
At a joint press conference in Berlin, Merkel said that Germany, Austria and Sweden cannot manage the single refugee crisis.
The German executive chief expressed support for the recent decision taken by Berlin to impose border controls on the massive flow of asylum seekers, stating that the measure aims to facilitate the registration of refugees.
At the same time, Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission's proposals for the redistribution of refugees among Member States on the basis of mandatory quotas - has decided to organise an extraordinary EU summit.
The EU Interior Ministers, meeting in Brussels last month, failed to adopt a new proposal for an urgent redeployment of 120,000 refugees among the Member States of the European Union, presented on 9 September by the European Commission.
The first point of the plan, represented by the urgent resettlement mechanism for refugees, provides for the rapid redistribution of 54,000 refugees in Hungary, 50,400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, new controversies
French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo once again raised controversy, after publishing cartoons that bore the responsibility of the predominantly Christian European countries to the wave of immigrants from the predominant Muslim territories affected by wars.
In the most recent number or, the publication has attracted attention again, as well as critics on social networks, the agency Reuters writes.
One of the drawings highlights a fascinating image of Aylan Kurdi, the angry Syrian boy, whose body arrived on one of the beaches of Turkey, after a severe attempt to cross the Great with the boat, by his family, from Syria to Greece.
Charlie Hebdo's drawing shows a child in short pants and shirts, with face down on the back of the sea, next to a advertising panel offering two menus for children at the price of one.
"So near to succeed," is the message that contains the drawing.
Another drawing, also the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack from the Paris editorial headquarters in January, is accompanied by the message "God that Europe is Christian".
The drawing presents a character like Jesus, who walks on the water, while a smaller character wears short pants with his feet up in the water, the first saying "Christians go on the water", takes the second "Muslim children fall apart".
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression, after an attack by the Islamic militants, in January, as a result of repeated threats after the beating of the prophet Mahomed.
A chain of supermarkets present in Romania, radically fined in Russia
The French auction of the Auchan supermarkets was fined with more than 370,000 dollars by Russian officials, being accused of food security intruders.
Anna Popova, head of the Russian Consumer Protection Agency Rosbrynadzor, said that the amnesty totalizes over 25 million rubles, i.e. $372.000, related to the Associated Press, quoted by US News.
There were no reasons why these threats were granted, and Auchan did not comment.
The French chain of supermarkets is also the ink of the accusations of the Russian Agency for Agriculture, which argues that some meat products have been found to be infected with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food controls come within a period of tension between France and Russia, on the basis of the extension of the European Union sanctions and the decision of France to cancel an understanding on the supply of Russian Mistral ships.
The Roman Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the news that Hungary could raise a metallic guard at the border with our country.
MAE appears to have been briefed on this decision and that it is not a fair political gesture.
MAE shows, in a communiqué sent to the newspaper Ziare.com, that it was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this intention shortly before it was announced public.
On the other hand, the MAE informed the competent decision-making factors in Romania in relation to this situation in good time.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that raising a guard between the two Member States of the European Union and which are strategic partners is not a fair political gesture, in accordance with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian parties, as shown in the communication.
Hungary plans to build a metal guard on a segment of the border with Romania, in the context of the immigration crisis, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto, quoted by Mediafax, said on Tuesday.
"The measure is necessary in order for trafficking in persons transiting Serbia to change its route, there is a likelihood of moving towards Romania," the Hungarian diplomat chief explained.
"The Guard would start from the border point between Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue on a reasonable distance if the migration pressure shifts to Romania," Szijarto explained.
At the end of August, the press reported that extra-Community immigrants crossing the Serbian territory on their way to the European Union were trying to bypass the guard built by Hungarian authorities through its east end, at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, extra-Community immigrants have discovered that they can clear the fence through the Majdan/Rade area (Serbia) - Baby Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza (Hungary).
The Hungarian government has allocated 22.2 billion forts (EUR 71.8 million) to build a controversial metallic guard on the border with Serbia, at a distance of 175 kilometres, and for the special centres needed for immigrants.
The Guard initiative is criticised by the European Union and Serbia.
No need, he'll stay there.
The script with the unintended body of Cornelius Vadim Tudor will not be deposited in the Senate of Romania, despite the will in this sense expropriated by the political leader.
According to a communiqué released Ziare.com, the Permanent Bureau of the Senate discussed, on Tuesday, a request by Doine Vadim Tudor, on the approval of the unincorporated body of former Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor at the Senate headquarters.
"From the receipt of this letter to the time of analysis, in the Permanent Bureau, the uninflicted body has already been placed in a cult lake and will remain there, the Permanent Office, appreciating that it is no longer necessary to be moved from there to the Senate of Romania," the Senate said.
Senator PNL Teodor Atanasiu argued that this request "is not in agreement with Romania's geographical position somewhere in Europe".
Also transmitted by Agerpres, senators held a moment of recollection in memory of former PRM leader, at the proposal of UNPR Senator Serban Mihaileescu.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor died, Monday night, around 6:30 p.m.
The president of the PRM went to the Army's Emergency Clinic Center for Cardiovascular Diseases.
The European Parliament will be inmortemated Thursday, from 12:00 to the Ghencea cemetery, and will have part of military honors.
Are the refugees coming to Romania?
Basics of granite sites, questions about accommodation
The mayors of the Arad border areas are questioned by the Police and the Border Police, these days, about the places of residence for refugees who might arrive in Romania, but also for Jandarmi, where they will be mobilized to the border.
The Edill of Nadlac, Vasile Ciceac, said he had meetings on this subject.
Discussions were conducted with farmers in the area, and they were asked to report on any foreign presence near the border.
I had discussions with border police, national police and local police, but also with farmers in the area.
We all need to be more vigilant in the next period.
"I have asked farmers, who have worked in this period on arable land, to be careful and report on any movement," the idea said.
Immigrants' Crisis Gives Choleote in Hungary: Blandates and Tunes of Water to the Granite
She, like other mayors in the border area with Hungary, said that the police had requested information on the accommodations available in the event of conflicts with a wave of refugees.
We were asked how many people we can hunt.
We don't have room for refugees in the community.
We believe that such special centres must not even appear at the border, because they are more difficult to control here, migrants are being tried to flee, because they are not interested in leaving Romania.
It would be best to find such centres in more remote areas of granite," said the mayor of Iratosu, Papp Atila Iosif.
On the other hand, the mayor of Dorobanti, Vincent Almasi, said he had been asked as many places of residence for refugees as for the intervention forces, in case they were mobilized in the area.
The police were wondering if we could make the case.
We could find places on the Cultural Way, but for refugees we have no possibility of accommodation.
"I have been asked about the length of the border with Hungary, probably working on an action plan," said Vincento Almasi.
He added that at the local police station, "initiating Tuesday, since Hungary sealed its border with Serbia, has been established permanently".
"There's always a police officer at the post, and the locals know that they have to inform if they see any stranger in the area," the editorial said.
Prime Minister Pilu's representatives said they could punish at least a hundred people, at the Cultural Path, with the information being offered to the police at their request.
The mayor of the city of Curtico, Nicolae Anitei, also stated that there are accommodation spaces in the former headquarters of local public finances, but there is a need for repairs here.
A former border police barracks could also be threatened to host refugees.
The representatives of the Jewish Police Press Office Arad did not offer a point of view on the question of primarys during this period, only confirming that "the patrol activities have been intensified in the Arad border areas".
Commander of the Army Club announced radical measures against Becali's Star
Commander of the Army Sports Club, Colonel George Boroi, announces a series of radical measures that will be taken against Gigi Becali's star.
Since the two parties have negotiated an impasse, Boroi argues that the Army will have its own football team, which will take over the historic palmares of the "ro-albasters".
The team that won the Cup of Champions is on the break.
"It's not a historic break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have a team, but things can change from next year," said Boroi at Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announced that the process by which Becali's team seeks damages will continue.
The period we refer to through the ICCJ decision is very clear.
We had to recover the damage from FC Steaua, the team that used the Steaua brand without the owner's acceptance - CSA Steaua.
It appears very clear and continuity of the section, which was actually permanent of the Army Club.
"So the Steaua Bucuresti football team, in a form or another, but in a legal form, must exist as a continuation of the professionals it has so far in palmares," said George Boroi.
Becali's star and the Army Club are in the open war since the end of last year, when the Supreme Court decided that the military are the ones holding the mark "the star".

The region that "coke" millionaires
This year, millions of Asian-Pacific people will form the wealthiest group in the world, thanks to the wealth accumulated in China and India, show a study published Wednesday by Capgemini and RBC Health Management.
According to this document, in 2015, the accumulated wealth of the millionaires in Asia Pacific will exceed the total of $15,800 billion registered in 2014, as well as the wealth of the millionaires in North America, which currently represents the richest people in the world, with a accumulated wealth of $16,200 billion, transmitted by the AFP.
The study specifies that the Asia Pacific region already has the largest number of very rich people, named in the High Net Worth Individuals financial jargon, HNWI, with 4.69 million such individuals in 2014, with 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are the people who can invest at least a million dollars, without taking account of the value of real estate and other properties.
"In the future, HNWI's wealth is expected to grow more in Asia Pacific than in any other region of the world, most of the new assets will come from the emerging economies of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand," is shown in the study carried out by Capgemini and RBC Health Management.
The report estimates that China and India account for nearly 10% of the total HNWI's wealth and are responsible for 17% of the overall growth of the new wealth after 2006.

"Dorel" mounted the back semafort
At Suceava, the workers mounted a semi-trailer with the top down, so instead of being insisted that they have to wait 4 seconds, the passersby get the "h" message, which I don't know how to decrypt.
Don't worry, anyway, everyone goes on the red, reports the truth.
Every time he cuts his head.
Two guys were to be taken up by a car because they passed on the red.
"The Rutier politicians should be here to help, until the world is used," said a woman for the quoted source.
The Semaforl was recently mounted in front of Piete Mari in the center of Sucevei, but the passersby do not seem willing to take it into account, as much as the information received seems to be incomprehensible.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of the 9-8-7 series.
If "Dorel" was doing his job properly and someone was responsible enough to give him the ok to finish the job, then he wouldn't have reached this absurd situation.
Head of Administration Streets and Systematization Road in Suceava Primary admitted with a feeling that it was the girl when the semafort began to work, but did not realize that something was wrong.
We used them, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.
"Even I was the girl when they were put into operation," said Stefan Vasincu, promising that the problem would be resolved in the shortest time.
Praise the Lord that he may be remedied, because there are situations in which "Dorel" has made irreparable damage.
For example, when he worked at the Giurgiu-Ruse pipeline, "Dorel" dropped the gap that knew the tunnel under the Danube, he did not know where, probably under the ground, the entropy, however it was not found, as even the Minister of Economy, Mihai Tudose, said.
Police put the water tunnels on immigrants
On the main border of Hungary and Serbia, Hungarian border crossings have used, Wednesdays, water tunnels and tear gas against immigrants.
Although Hungary closed the granite with a gimpata sarma guard and introduced harsh measures against illegal immigrants, including the arrest, at the sarbo-ungara granite they continued to gather refugees, The Guardian writes.
The water tunnels were put into operation when immigrants managed to patrol through the sarma gimpata through the crossing point at the Roszke border.
Hungarian police maintain that the action of the tunas was a mass control measure, which throws water bottles.
There are no reports of possible injuries, but some people were crying, after the use of tear gas.
The publication of Elina Enikos writes at the same time that two German companies refuse to deliver the sarma gimpata to Hungary.
Tara has already raised the fence to the border with Serbia and Tuesday announced her intention to raise one and to the border with Romania, a strong initiative criticised in Bucharest.
German companies maintain that gimpata sarma is very dangerous and causes cuts that can be infected.
It is used to secure the incarceration or military facilities, but it should not be used against the people who are looking for it, supporting companies.
In parallel with the border crossings of Hungary, Croatia has mobilized to make the bus immigrants available to transport those present at the border with Serbia.
The Croatian Ministry of the Interior confirmed that the buses were sent to the border to take immigrants to the reception centres.
373 people have entered Croatia towards Serbia, including 73 children, the Ministry has shown more.
Tsipras, on Greece's drama - why is it agreed with the third EU agreement
The stated purpose of former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from more austerity and change its fundamental relationship with EU leadership from Brussels.
Finally, the Syrian leader made Greece part of a third loan agreement for this country, which involves more years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, who conducts an interview with it.
Now, however, Tsipras asks the Greeks to reinstate their mandate as prime minister in some of the elections that he argues will undermine his political position.
Our goal was to get an agreement, not a euro area exit or a euro area demarcation.
"Now, for the first time, it remains the possibility of restructuring the debt for Greece," the former elite said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
"But we knew from the beginning that any compromise would be concluded in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
It is of the opinion that the financing part of the agreement is a great success for the elen government, making it clear that all the financial needs of the country are covered by the year 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras continues to say that Greece "surely needs reforms", stating that it must start with state reform.
Tsipras announced his resignation on August 27, thus opening the way for early elections in September, after 7 stormy months in front of the Athens Executive, during which a third rescue loan was approved for Greece.

Activist from Star Trek, in prison for being naked in front of some children
Actrita Jennifer Lien, known as Star Trek, where he played for three seasons, intrusive of Kes, was arrested for improper exposure to some children.
The incident that led her to prison, where she was from September 3rd - the demand was fixed at $2,500 - and took place in front of her house in Tennessee.

Stop supporting terrorism!
Syrian President Bashar al Assad gave a rare interview with the Russian press, in which he spoke about refugees and accused the West of supporting terrorists and of "taking a vision" of immigrants.
"The West weeps for them and the West supports terrorists from the beginning of the crisis, when he said it is a passionate revolt," Assad said in an interview given by Russia Today.
The leader of Damascus argues that his Western counterparts say about the situation in Syria that he is a terrorist like the Islamic State, "but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president".
As long as this propaganda follows, there will be more refugees.
So it's not about the fact that Europe didn't accept them or hug them as refugees, it's about not dealing with the cause.
If you're worried about them, you don't support terrorists anymore.
That's what we believe about the crisis.
"This is the core of the whole refugee affairs," the Syrian leader added.
Assad continued the charges against the Western states and regarding the treatment they showed to the refugee girl.
It is like the West now cries for refugees with an eye and takes them in view with a second eye with a mitral, because those refugees actually left Syria because of terrorism, mainly because of terrorists and crimes, and in the second round because of the results of terrorism.
"When terrorism and the destruction of infrastructure, you will not have the basic resources, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to ruin their existence somewhere in this world," Bashar al Assad says.
"If we were to ask any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and every family'," the Syrian presidents stressed, adding as political forces, whether it's inside or outside the government, "we should gather around what the Syrian people want."
The President of Syria is of the opinion that the country's dialogue should continue "to reach a consensus", which cannot be implemented "as long as we violate terrorism in Syria".
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask all the forces to join against terrorism, because it is how the political goals that we, as Syrians, want through dialogue and political action, can be achieved," Bashar al Assad said.
He also spoke about one of his country's allies, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, claiming that, in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, he was transformed, from a friend of the West, into his enemy.
Bashar al Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, accusing the West of falsifying the reality in both cases.
Notice what happened in the Western press after the strike in Ukraine.
What happened?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and was characterized as a tar.
It is portrayed as a dictator who suppresses the opposition from Russia and who has reached power through non-democratic means, despite being elected in democratic elections, and the West itself acknowledged that the elections were democratic.
Now, I'm no longer democratic.
"This is Western propaganda," said Damascus's leader.
Not at last, it included Russia on the list of friends - and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, alongside Iran and Iraq, "because it faces the same type of terrorism".
Instead, Bashar al Assad criticised Turkey, another neighbouring country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said that "I can't even make a move without first coordinating with the United States and other Western countries".
In addition, Syria's president accuses the "International Coalition", led by the United States, who fights terrorism: "In fact, when this Coalition began to operate, the Islamic State began to expand".
In other words, the coalition has gone out and has no impact on the ground.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western countries that provide coverage for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight against terrorism.
You can't be with and against terrorism at the same time.
"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, it will stop you - then we have no object to cooperate with all these countries, given that it is a real coalition and not a false, that will fight against terrorism," the leader from Damascus said.
Toamna?
Not a word.

Map of the Tari with the largest cheapinaries and how to stay Romania
The collapse of the oil quota has caused great losses in the last year to workers in the extraction of the title, shareholders of energy companies and countries that depend heavily on this resource.
There is also a positive effect: petrol has been very cheap.
A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that, in the period October 2014 - July 2015, in almost all 76 countries taken into account, the price of the fuel has dropped.
The most important reduction in the price of the pump is seen in Venezuela.
In this country, the engine has saved 97%, so you can feed 24 SUVs with less than a dollar.
On the opposite pole is Saudi Arabia, where the price is fixed by four states.
The cost of the engine varies from country to country, depending on the refining conditions, the changes in taxation, but also the fluctuations in the exchange rate.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg turned the average price from each state into US dollars.
The situation in Romania
The Bloomberg data show that in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gallon of gasoline (approx. 3.8 liters) was $5.49.
So, we were in place 27 in the range of tars with the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this position in the top.
The last quarter of 2014, petrol was also cheap in novels.
Then, the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a 10.6% price reduction.
Still, the tides around are getting better.
In Bulgaria, a gas gallon cost $4.92, and in Hungary, $5.20.
Germans set the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised, on Tuesday night, that the federal government will grant additional support to the 16 countries of the federation to receive and distribute tens of thousands of migrants entering the country through southern Europe.
After a meeting of nearly 4 hours with the prime ministers of the 16 federal states, Merkel said "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to deal with the large number of refugees," the DPA said.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 places for initial arrivals, as well as distribution centres.
"I need such pivot points," she stressed.
The whole country must provide a massive boost to make the crisis face, Merkel added.
The country's Prime Minister has requested more aid than the 6 billion euros agreed by the ruling coalition at the federal level over a week.
Turkey's Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow of the Stanga Party asked for an amount "the least double, and for commitments, to be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister of the Land of Renania-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into German society.
"We need a national pact among all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also businesses, trade unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also asked that the bureaucracy in handling refugees and migrants be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed the process in 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
The Prime Minister of Bavaria Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
So far, Bavaria is carrying the worst burden, with the most migrants arriving after crossing the border with Austria.
Seehofer, a strong actor on the federal stage as head of the Crestin-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, entered into a public conflict with Merkel after the Chancellor announced a virtual policy of open use at the beginning of the month, recalled DPA.
Mircea Lucescu makes a scandal after the humiliating breach with Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a nervous car at the end of the game with Real Madrid, which Sahtior Dontk lost with 0-4.
The Roman coach turned out to be completely disturbed by arbitration, saying that Sahtior lost his intruder was disadvantaged.
Before the match, I said one thing, that I want to be respected.
Unfortunately, in the games with important teams in Europe, we are always in favour of arbitration.
There are two totally different ways.
We're given a yellow cardboard right away, while the top teams don't.
Besides, the first penalty wasn't in any case!
The minge hit Darijo's back, without touching his hand.
A similar level game should not be influenced by arbitration.
"Regreed that the arbitration broke the game," Mircea Lucescu said at the press conference.
"Ma'am, but what smells so ugly here?"
They were torn apart by their husbands
A murder of a sadism that came out of the community threatened the inhabitants of Targu Frumos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, at the first hour of the day, the marketers in Targu Frumos were able to see terrifying scenes near the main entry into the market.
In addition to the three tomberoons, criminals have "assembled" out of pieces what seemed to be a man's body.
It was tense, but it was missing its head, internal organs and genitals.
Finally, it was to prove that it was the body of a former officer, who had been harassed by his wife, professor of geography.
"The newspaper of Iaşi" has been speaking in private even with the taximer who has helped the killer, without knowing, on the road of the bags with the dead body.
His stories make your hair soft.
The one who warned police yesterday about the fact that a woman whose three bags were doing terrible, after cutting from the body was found on the market, was a taximer from Targu Frumos.
As in American films, the man himself helped carry bags full of human pieces, which smelled hard, but not knowing, the killer being his client for a race.
The taximert told, exclusively for the "Iaşi Journal", the shocking scenes he's gone through, helping without wanting a killer to hide evidence.
It carried with his hands the bags where the body parts of the professor of geography were found, which he was transcribed to.
She came to the Beautiful Square to hide the evidence of the crime, as far as her home from Rome.
Maybe he's mine.
I didn't have how you know.
Nea Mihai, as is known by his friends who practice taximetry in Targu Beautiful, came to see over the night in the small town he lives in.
He's seen American films all his life, but he never thought he'd ever catch himself standing on the basis of the discovery of a sad crime, and he'll see with his eyes pieces of corpses.
It tells that, on the night of the month to Tuesday, it usually expects the arrival of buses that cross the locality regularly.
It is near the intersection of the roads to Roman and Pascani.
The taximeterist says that the woman who was killed noticed her in the mirror, next to the bags with body pieces supported by the indicator showing the nearby locations.
She came at night with the Massaro race from 1.30.
The car left it at 10 metres from the pedestrian crossing to Pascani, right at the well where the kilometer is displayed.
The bags were picked up by the counter with the indicator.
After the bus left, I put in the marcher ten meters up to it.
I opened the trunk and, after putting a bag, I asked, "Ma'am, but what smelled so ugly here?"
I saw she was an old woman, and I told her to help her.
I thought he was taking meat to the market, to the shop, maybe he's got mine, I didn't know how to know.
I thought he might want to fool someone with that ugly meat.
She was trying to lift a bag alone, and I refused to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
"He specified me to go to the big door of the market, when I took it from the bus," Mihai began to tell her.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He completed that the woman said absolutely nothing, and, therefore, he was no longer interested in asking her anything.
Until the destination, I didn't say anything, because I was nervous that he put my shoe in the car.
And when he put the bags down from the car, I noticed that smells and more ugly.
She dropped the bags out of the trunk.
When I got back in the car, I put two meters in the back to get back, and I realized I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and I moved the car back and forth, to disappear the smell.
I didn't notice if someone was helped to get the bags, because I had lights in the back and I didn't see them well in the mirror.
"There were two plastic bags and one rifle," the man completed.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, she says she's beginning to notice the curiosity.
In my mind, I realized something was wrong.
After she put her bags down, I went to the hospital, to Primarie, and when I came back, I especially forgot to see what the woman was doing with the luggage.
In the meantime, she carried the luggage after the guard, where there are also the drums inside the market.
Then I left again.
It was a little nervous, because they arrived a microbus from Italy and a bus.
I've seen the woman go to their drivers to get into them, disappear, but probably the drivers didn't want to take her, because they have international courses, and I don't take passengers on occasions.
The woman was very excited, she walked over and over.
At a given time, the woman entered Peco and, curiously, I asked an employee outside what she had done inside.
The employee told me he went and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where the police patrol would be, because we'd been seeing her for a while.
I searched them and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and I told them there's something suspicious.
"Then I went to the other side, a race to Belcești," she completed Mihai.
He told us that the woman got agitated after she left the trunk at the graveyard.
At me, the suspicion went away from the fact that the bag was gone, and I was curious what he did with it.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and showed her to me, telling her that I warned her that she had a suspect's luggage.
Then the woman went to the tomberoons and showed them the luggage.
"I went back to where the bags had been hidden around 3:00 when I gave statements to the police and the prosecutors from the scene," the cabimeter report ended.
The Neamt prosecutors, who investigate the case, say that the 64-year-old professor, Ana Zaharia, was surprised by the cameras to take a look at a gas station in Rome at 0.55, coming up with the three bags in the car.
She arrived at the Fairy Market at 1.30.
According to the investigators, she would have killed her husband, with whom she had been married for four years, with a knife, and then dragged him into the house.
The man was named Gheorghe Zaharia, and he was a reserve officer.
On Sunday night, the woman put the pieces of the body in two plastic bags, which she carried to the garage, and hid them.
On the other hand, he transported one more, then decided which way to go, and chose the bus Bucharest - Iaşi.
Last night, the procurators still didn't know where the wife hid her husband's internal organs, nor the genitals.
But the head was found wrapped in newspapers and bags, in a leak from the woman's apartment.
She was retired, like her husband.
Until last night, the prosecutors did not find out from a woman who was the reason why she killed her husband with so much cold blood and sadism.
Most likely, the professor will be mentally experienced, and the body will be examined by legal doctors to officially determine the cause of death and any other relevant details.
The Prime Minister took the national roads at the municipal level, after years ago these were taken by the Government, to be able to raise money from the national budget in the 2004 election campaign.
The decision was taken yesterday by the Local Council (CL) and a decision of the Government is required to be implemented.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a matter for this institution to give an opinion on the General Banistic Ur Plan (PUG).
The mayor took over a network of 11 km of roads.
In any event, a legislative amendment which was adopted in July 2015 requires the municipality to take the national roads that cross the municipality.
No opinion can be delivered from the National Roads if the law is not respected, so it was necessary to approve this.
National roads have gone into our administration since today.
"Of course, the decision of the government will also have to be issued as a result of this local Council decision," said interim Prime Minister Mihai Chirica.
National roads that call the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The 28th National Road hits the Iasúl on the arteries: the Păcurari Street, the Monteni Street (to be mafort), the Moara de Fire, the Silver Road, the Silver Street, the Nicolae Iorga Street, the Spring Road, the Chişina Street, the Cisina Road, the town road until the exit of the municipality to Tomești - Albitza.
The other national road, DN 24, includes Bucium, bd. Socola (up to semafor), bucium (up to base 3), Chisinău Street, bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, bd. C.A. Rosetti and exit to Cârlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
In continuing to describe some files of the "dore" of Mircea Eliade's political youth sympathies, which, however condensate, would be presented beyond the size of a daily article and should be broadcast in the series, deserves, I think, the famous friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most powerful accused of using the great Roman detractors.
A less immoral description would be, I hope, useful in the actual debate that the law is recently called "antilegionary", it would have to be crushed in the Romanian intellectual environment.
Criticizing the various versions that discussed Elijah's settlement in the Legion by means of the Cube "Axa" and Radu Gyr, Florin TUURCANU brings into discussion the volume Mircea Eliade.
The prisoner of history (Bucuresti, 2003), another hypothesis, which is most interested in understanding the resumption of epistolic contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after Ceausescu played "the balcony scene" that August.
Based on the documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure, during the security investigation, in 1941, documents kept today in the SRI archive (FD, Dosar 573, f.15) as well as a follow-up note from 1938, Florin Čurcanu states that "Eliades will not enter their group, but thus said "legionary family" called Lumința, a group of "cuiburi" intellectuals, especially writers, led by the poet Radu Gyr".
As there is no verifiable data about the Luminity, those in exile considering the existence of this questionable "legionary family", which must be discussed, until the context in which this information was recorded in the file.
By leaving to a surprising part of the SRI's willingness to make these secret files available to Mr. Türcanu, it is more than obvious that, at that time, the aim of the Security pursuit was "commandant" Radu Gyr, Elijah's mention of himself, in the context of which Armand Călinescu, the Minister of the Interior took all the necessary steps to enforce his Royal dictatorship, suspending parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of legionnaires who began to enjoy an unexpected popularity (the whole country's party for the third election in 1937).
The arrest of Eliade was carried out as a result of this note, quoted by Čurcanu: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, framed in the Legionary Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a subterfuge bureaucratic coverage for the 1938 repression and it is likely that such superficial notes would have been made at the resale for the vast majority of legionnaires or sympathians active in the public space that had to be arrested, but which should have been linked by an important legional leader.
Radu Gyr's holograph statement mentioned above, given in the arrest in February 1941, after the fall of the legionary rebellion, only confirms it retrospectively on the first, the banal method of bureaucratic coverage in any police regime, author.
It would be interesting if Čurcanu had provided more details on the content of the mentioned file 573.
Was that Elijah or Radu Gyr's file?
Because it has to be a file built on the basis of the security documents, but then processed by Security to be used either against the other.
There is a mistake here, as in the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only someone who knows how to achieve the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious basis knows that it is a pre-eminent stage, of proof, in which the person in question acts as an active sympathizer, found in the three-year trial period before becoming a "camrad" with acts in order.
Also, all these forms of secondary organization such as clubs or intellectual dinners, seats, discussion groups with citizens, youth organisations or students gravely around a cube, were his "family", they were not the cubs themselves, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of bride escapes the uninvited reader completely by making Elijah's "member" status (which may be plausible) be understood and used by letter to designate the political regime in the cave.
Of course, the call for subtle interpretation of this kind cannot conceal the public activity of supporting the Guard and no clear sympathy for the Captain who encouraged Eliade in the period 1935-1940, whether or not in the seat of Nae Ionescu.
The public support of a case in which you believe does not necessarily mean, however, and the political settlement itself as well as, as a rule, intellectuals of this case retain a kind of superiority in the face of activists as such and does not enter into politics unless they are given directly high privileges.
As far as I could think of Elijah's thinking at that time, in which he was "the leader of a young generation", I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted the hierarchical rigors from a legionary cube.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendent, though!
To no longer mean, but in the past, that, in any legionary "file", what receives is anti-Semitic public activity as well as violence, both worthy of being stigmatized, but not in the case of Eliade, until we test.
With regard to the correspondence of Eliade-Gyr from 1968 to 1969, Mircea Handoca, a defender of Eliade, tries to penalise Florin Čurcanu's claims (based, however, on some archive documents, even if it was worth more serious and contextualised) with a discussionable argument.
Mircea Handoca notes, in the volume of Our Gloves on Mircea Eliade (Bucuresti, 2006), that "there is no order of correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr contains no allusion to this framework".
He didn't even have the way in 1968, when Radu Gyr came out of the Communist era, he couldn't risk an allusion in a letter that was obviously intercepted by censorship.
What I think meant by Mircea Handoca is that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectable, admired and affection without any doubt about Elijah's ascension.
There really is no even the slightest suggestion that Radu Gyr would ever have been Eliade's boss.
intelligently, the poet obliged to write at the Glass of Patriots, returns from the top of his seat the stunning condition by signaling to Eliade (who knew very exactly what the mission had that publication that was constantly dealing with the degradation of the right exile), in the signature, after "your old friend", what to expect and is visible to him easily and happily when he responds to him in affection after almost three decades of separation since "the viclean time" trained him.
There is no doubt about the fact that, beyond the "mission" with which he was charged (to convince Elijah that now, in the new Romania, he could return at least quietly to see his mother and friends) and that, ablely, he also fulfills it by short proposals, apart from paragraphs, to suggest their character as a foreign body, Radu Gyr shows his interest only for literature.
No mention of esoteric allusions, of refined political complicities suggested or of any exaggeration of the years of youth in a register other than cultural.
It is hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior to the legionary line of Eliade, but until this version is consolidated with less circumstantial evidence than that offered by Florin Čurcanu, we have in this corresponding memory loops that testify to a mutual appreciation of certain characters that have marked different, but stately, our culture and, beyond the trials of life, we find the tone of civilization and interbaltic education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not, pillars for the strength of friendship and mutual respect beyond the author's "under time" destiny.
At the beginning of the 1970s, Eliade finally gave up his refugee status by getting American citizenship and, under the pretext offered by the country's health and disaster floods, announced to the RSR authorities through the embassy (with a sporadic correspondence used to obtain passport for his sister), that he could not take the invitation to return to the country.
The next was predictable: it's back to the index, it's mounted in Israel the Toladot business, the books sent to the family and friends (Fragments of a newspaper, Gallicard, 1973) are stopped by censorship, never again to his mother.
Among friends in the country only with Noica has a sporadic correspondence, although surprisingly, like a Chicago personal archive, a lot of individuals or Romanian institutions are more able to send messages to them.
It's clear why Radu Gyr was no longer allowed to write after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Czech regime tried the second operation of Elijah's conversion (by official invitations, Noica's demises, translations, etc.) Radu Gyr has already passed into eternity.
New coach, foreign player
Because of the lack of autohtone volleyballists, Penicilina Iaşi tested in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
Exits take part in the training tour under coach Dan Gavril's command
Back in the first half of the year of the A1 women's volleyball division, Penicilina Iaşi kept his place on the first stage due to the retreat and then the decommissioning of the Miroslava Science training, a freshly promoted in the first stage following a barrage tour even in the island community.
The news took little of the unprepared lead of the exit group, which woke up without the main coach (after the departure of Rareș Puni, reached second to Bacău Science) and many missing players, some retired like Cristina Lungu and the free Diana Stidneanu, or gone, like Ana-Maria Berdilla (at the Blue Flight Championship) and the sisters Maria and Iuliana Fica.
It appears, until the start of the scheduled championship on October 10th, there was still time to complete the lot.
First, a new coach was found in Dan Gavril's person, who came from the male team LPS Piatra Neamt and who has worked a little bit more in Penicillina, and he is proud to sign a contract with the group led by the Left Vasile.
Two players from Miroslava Science, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconic were then brought, being tried and a few foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, closer to the transfer being the festive Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and the Montenegrin Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the Peniciline lot led by Dan Gavril performed a canton at the Gura Humori, after which he participated in a tour conducted at Lugoj and equipped with the Banat Cup, in which the exits achieved a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but also suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
Next week, from 23 to 25 September, Penicilina will take part in another tour in Craiova.
For the new championship, we're trying to get a valuable team.
We have a skilled and experienced coach, but the player fund in Romania is pretty low and that's why we'll call foreign volleyballists, especially after the decision has been made that teams can use an unlimited number of players outside the country.
This decision will affect the young generation of sports from clubs in Romania.
"We hope to reach the end of the competition year in 5-6 places, even if it will be very difficult," said Vasile Left, president of ACS Penicilina Iaşi.
Emotional meeting.
Gems gathered after almost 70 years
The twins George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, aged 69, were born at the end of the Second World War in Germany, after their mother of Polish origin had just been released from a labor camp.
Since she was too ill to care for her, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, the two brothers being so separated not only from the one who gave them life, but also from the other.
Ten years George and Lucian didn't know each other about the other's existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered the documents that showed that he was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the 1960s, Crocea Rošie prayed to help him find his brother, but they found no clues leading him to Lucian.
In 2015, thanks to the program, "Restoring Family Links" of the Red Cross, the twins met again, and the moment was one more than exciting.
BBC reporters surprised this episode.
Ten children from Iaşi brought home from Stuttgart four medals to sports dance
Two gold medals, a silver medal and a bronze medal were won by the children who came out to the German Open Championship from Stuttgart, an international sport dance competition organised by the German Federation of Sports Dance and the World Dance Federation.
Of these five pairs participated in the Dance Energy Club and danced along with 9,000 athletes from 20 countries.
The 10 children left participated in five different categories (youths 1 and 2 June 2 and amateurs).
Those who returned home with the medals were the beads: Rázvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Târzianu (two gold medals and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosă and Otilia Ştefana Gologan (the bronze medal).
And three other pairs managed to occupy the front seats: Bogdan Stelian Duminic and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Ioana Iosub Cujb and not least the pair Andrei Emilia and Raluca Elena Ionică.
As a coach, I greatly wanted to confirm the results achieved in March of this year, and this confirmation is needed for both us and athletes, as regards their future developments.
The fact that we managed to make Romania hear twice this year at the German Open and return home with four medals makes us very happy and gives us hope and confidence that we can raise both the club and its athletes to a higher level.
"All of these would only be feasible with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work," said Andreea Ramona Manolache, a coach for children from the Dance Energy Club.
Romania has been represented this year by 34 clubs in the country, it receives a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country as 4 of the 20 participating countries.
Noted that from the new medals, four came to Iasi.
6 methods to escape stress in a minute
Too few of us allow us to run for a weekend on the mountain to escape stress.
Some of us have our time, some of us have our finances, and some of us have both obstacles.
There are solutions to anyone who wants to escape a little stress.
These do not involve high costs and no special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
Day-to-day strikes are inevitable, but it depends on us how we do them and what attitude we take them.
Instead of eating inside and feeling an implosion takes place in your mind, you better try the following relaxation tactics that won't steal more than a minute.
Deep breaths
Respiratory exercises are not intended only for soloists or yoga practitioners.
They work for any person in part, and the regulation of breathing in a tense moment helps to release endorphins into the body, which leads to a state of relaxation, reports Livestrong.
Be a Child
We know we've gone beyond the age of copying and we don't let ourselves get together when we have the boss.
But that doesn't mean that we can't go in a corner of the office office or anywhere we know we're alone (even behind the building) and not to type as much as we're holding the flames.
You can escape from the nerves and the negative energy accumulated during one day with some healthy flights.
Imagine a nice place
We know that the recommendation is worthy of a replica from a psychotherapy session, but I don't want psychologists to use it often.
The imagination of a beautiful place, which inspires us to calm down and absorb daily braking, can lead to attenuating the state of the nerves.
It is really about self-suggestion, a process that can even change lives, both in good, and in bad.
It all depends on what we've been up to.
It's best to think of an idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to music
Put your castles in your ears and listen to the music of relaxation.
Attention, it's not about the favorite music, because if it's about heavy metal you might be having a hard time relaxing.
Listen even to the relaxation melodies, which are lines and do not contain verses, to regain balance at the moment that you've reached the fitile.
Decoy of orange
Does it sound strange the advice of decoying a orange in the nerves?
Well, it's not!
Caci is not about the fruit itself, because it does not contain miraculous substances or Xanax to disconnect us completely (occasionally, too total).
It's aroma therapy!
The smell of orange coyote during decoying stimulates the brain to produce endorphins, the hormone of good condition.
Mangae and animals
Those who have animals nearby, whether it's about the one in the house, or it's about the one who's sitting next to the job, take a few seconds to eat it.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, animal mangai may drop blood pressure.
watch and rock with violin and guitar
Two musicians in love with instruments such as rivals, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous parts of the Roman folklore combining life with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to the musicians Christian Horia and Emilian Florentin Georghe and is titled WHEN violin Meets Guitar, writes hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We found ourselves, and from that moment on it made us very happy to sing together, having a practically unlimited repertoire."
We thought this was the moment when a life met with a guitar.
Cristi: "From the first meeting we realized that what we were singing is very good and that, from the point of view of the human component, things work."
Each of us has learned from the other repertoire, and what is very important is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentin: "I know there's a gap between the people of classical music and the rest."
I think a lot of people can listen to classical music.
And in the second round we were still stealing a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between the genres, we want to offer a genre of music that can do to those who only listen to classical music to listen and rock, and to those who only listen to rock to like classical music.
And we were surprised to be told at the end of a concert that they never imagined they'd listen to something like that and they'd like it.
Cristi: "When we find young people - and we find out more and more - who I know who Pink Floyd was, it seems amazing to us."
The students from Iaşi stayed more in traffic than at school on the first day of the holiday
Hundreds of exits were "captives" yesterday in the infernal traffic in several areas.
The Prime Minister announced that today, the Mangeron bullevardul (splai Bahlui mal left), between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roş, is closing.
Chiefs of the Prime Minister have not complied with their commitments to carry out work for the smoothing of traffic at the beginning of the school year.
One of the insurances that the municipality has given them, at least twice in the last few weeks, has seen the reintroduction of the rotation in the International War area.
Although only a few items had to be installed, and the last time the work was done was the end of last week, yesterday the rotation was not made.
Driver nerves were reached to the maximum on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, given that another promise of the primacy was violated: moving the customs activity from Nicolae Iorga to Tehnopolis "the late end of August", in the context of which this transfer has been discussed since 2012.
Currently, interim mayor Mihai Chirica says the issue of the International Race is more complicated.
The rotation will be done at the right time, we need to take account of the traffic of the trams in the area, we need an opinion and from the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbabwe, where it's time for the tram to stay in rotation, but we'll sort it out in a way," Chirica said.
One of the solutions, according to that, would be to stop the traffic with a semafort before turning.
The problems in circulation were also in the intersection of Podu Roş.
The car code on the road, the Saint Lazarus, extended to the SRI headquarters.
"I waited a good minute to get out to Podu Roș," said one output.
By Podu Roş, it was necessary in September to move trams to CUG if the project of rehabilitation "Development and rehabilitation of the South Functional Arteries" was completed in the initial term of execution (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complement the original one.
"I drew European funds for new work, for example overlonging, on the initial version of the Nicolaina Pass was narrow," Chirica commented.
The most recent deadline for the re-introduction of the tram traffic is October.
During the day yesterday, the exits reported problems in traffic especially in areas such as Păcurari, Centre (Târgu Cucu, Independence, Armenian Street) or the intersection of Base 3.
Adonity could be back as head of the CJ.
In the course of tomorrow you'll know for sure.
The judges of the Court will decide tomorrow whether the President-in-Office of the Jewish Council will maintain judicial control and prohibitions.
The judges of the Iaşi Tribunal have issued a new term in the "Album" file yesterday, in which the President of the Iaşi Jewish Council is also indicted.
At the end of yesterday's sitting, the magistrates decided to vote in the morning on the measure of judicial control currently imposed against the Adomnia.
It therefore wishes to hold or revoke this measure, which is kept away from the CJ's head office for several months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if it will be maintained by the superior court, Christian Adomnita will be able to resume his office as president of the CJ.
Addomnity was sent to the Court by the Antico Ruttà National Directorate (DNA), being accused of favouring the manufacturer and false intellectuals after, I say to the curators, he would have tried to mask an audit control which revealed a series of irregularities regarding the reception of a public contract signed between CJ and Laser Co.
The House would have tried to hide the fact that the institution that led it would not have received more material to promote the trial of Iaşi, although in writing these materials were shown to be received by the CJ.
In addition, he has been referred to justice and three CJ directors, as well as the administrator of Laser Co.
Still 3,500 outs are expected to vote until 25 September
The prime minister is prepared to distribute other questions if the 12,000 will be exhausted.
The exits have only ten days to express their opinion on the replanting of the Great Stephen.
According to the municipal officials, some 8,500 of the 12,000 questionnaires distributed to the city centres and three additional points in the city (Copou Park, Planda Alexandru of Good and Primery).
A record number of exits was presented on Sunday in front of the Prime Minister.
According to the representatives of the civilian group, "The House loves the teas", 530 exits voted in 140 minutes, and almost four votes expressed every minute.
Instead, over the course of the month, about 440 came out in the same place.
The group's volunteers say that many exits are calling for a new signal and the population's lack of efficiency in public consultation.
Therefore, they called on Internet users yesterday to print a group-available information sheet and to hide it in the block stairs.
Volunteers also showed that at the additional point in the Copou Park the last forms were completed by Sunday exits.
We'll provide a form from the neighborhoods, where it's not too complete.
"Sometimes we will make supplements when all the 12,000 forms will be completed," the municipality's spokesman Sebastian Burga said yesterday.
"Storage voids" will end on September 25, and if the majority vote of the exits is in favour of the replanting of trees then the Prime Minister will plant your silver in this bush.
The exits can express their opinion at the city centres of Dacia, Frumosa, Tátărași, Nicolaina and Păcurari, as well as at the additional points mentioned above.
The Chiefs of the primacy decided to cut off the Great Stephen in early 2013, an action that attracted an amendment of 60,000 lei to the municipality.
The decision was taken unilaterally, without consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civic group "Iasul loves them", an online community of about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civic group for their replanting was signed, until yesterday evening, more than 9.100 supporters.
RECORD of students registered at USAMV Iaşi!
I'm 920 in year I
The university has 920 students this year in year I.
Representatives of the University of Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" specified that this year were the most eligible candidates ever, in the history of the higher education institution, since the establishment.
We are very grateful for the results of this year's admission.
We have the largest number of admitted candidates in university history, almost 920 students in the year I. We have never exceeded such a number.
"We also had senior candidates, we occupied the budgets at the license and master," said Prof. Ioan Tienu, a procurator in charge of the teaching activity.
It further stated that the university has registered a considerable number of tax students, occupying 20% of those places, a significantly higher figure than in other years.
Although results have also been published in the Romanian-language study lines, the English-language study programme from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, which has taken 50 places, where the fee is EUR 5,000, is now expected to be answered by the minister regarding the confirmation of the required student files and study visas.
At the autumn session, a total of 120 files were submitted to the 14 budgeted seats and 209 were taken to competition under the "tax" scheme, to the licensing studies.
Most files were filed at the Faculty of Agriculture, in the number of 75 in Horticulture, were 23, and at Zootechnie, 22.
At the master's session were 18 files, at the 150 tax spots proposed by USAMV, seven of them in Agriculture, five in Horticulture and six in Zootechnie.
Drivers are afraid to enter the wheels of the cars on the Tudor Vladimirescu bridge
The bridge over the Bahlui from Tudor Vladimirescu was as narrow as when "The Day of Iasi" wrote about the problems they presented 10 days ago.
Our daily reports then indicated that on the axis that delimits the two motions of march the asphalt was left, defending deep pits, some even 20 centimeters, through which concrete plates representing the primary infrastructure of the bridge are seen.
The asphalt also began to be fixed on one side and on the other side, with signs that the depths would be accentuated.
At that time, interim mayor Mihai Chirica states that the bridge has no structural problems, recently being made a technical expertise to start a project to rehabilitate the bridge and tram, worth EUR 5 million.
Prime Minister Chirica states that the area affected by fissures and pits will be signalled, with rapid asphalt restoration work being carried out.
However, the only measures taken so far have been the assembly of peoples and a signaling ban, without even a simple flood.
In this period, we have focused more on opening school and the necessary work to that end.
"There is a point-by-point expertise for the bridge that we expect for about a week with the necessary details of the intervention, I appreciate that within two weeks we could move on to remedy the situation," the interim mayor said.
Early school year
Yesterday, my big son, Stefan, started school.
The preparatory class, as he tries to improve the situation.
I don't know if I'm happy or let go of melancholy; turn, passive, to the second variant.
First, because I've had the feeling that it's only been three weeks, not three years since I took him for the first time, with emotion, to the gradient.
Although it's easy, no normal parent is happy to raise their children.
Second, because I remember perfectly the same day of my childhood; then a story that, in the end, has not yet ended.
I wasn't even what's usually called a conscientious student.
On the contrary, I would say.
But I always liked school.
So much, I chose to continue to attend, even if I was a teacher.
When I decided that this was what I wanted to do all my life, I knew it wasn't an easy job.
And no one with a desk.
That's because, just like each one of us, I've given myself over to the whole class of teachers: better or worse, more sympathetic or unbearable, smarter or rightless.
It happens, unfortunately, that there are people with other calls in this puzzle.
I think they're toxic, because they hurt the enthusiasm and even the mind of a young person willing to be formed.
I had the luck to give, as a student or as a student, over a few, a few, buttocks.
These meetings can be decisive, if they happen at the right time.
Who thinks that the role of the camp is the banal transmission of some information is awfully wrong.
This can be done by anyone; to inform the student very well by one, that we live only in a time of transparency.
A good teacher, however, models the minds of the students.
He's training them. He's flattering their thinking.
Staying in the camp is not a privilege, as I think it is, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very mofturous, demanding, unforgiving and always willing to look for the wiles of those in front of them.
That's how old they are, temperament.
In adolescence, we all thought we knew everything, that we had doubts about anything.
When we mature, we get to understand that we only have doubts.
That's why a teacher's role is to get the teenager out of the self-sufficiency category and make him think.
I mean, starting to doubt, asking questions.
To discover on their own account the answers, both them and the provisions.
To get involved in everything he does.
To direct him discreetly to the profitable models.
It's very difficult, especially that most of the time the student thinks the teacher is his enemy.
One who hardly expects to catch him on the wrong foot to punish him.
But this corrects him, the foolish, the rebellious, to live up to his old-age calls, to look at him from the chair with suspicion.
That he just doesn't have a natural way to accept his attempt to order him.
Adolescents are not allowed to get to the point, they do not accept restrictions.
Or if I give the impression that I'm doing it, she's revenged somehow.
And, unfortunately, when there is a stiff person at the camp, who is forced by hardness and does not communicate, the students are revenged on the object delivered.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with the great writers because of the lack of touch of the Romanian professor.
There are thousands of such students who have the impression that history is a data breach, that mathematics is all that can be more tired of their unsatisfied mind.
I always ask for students: if you give a teacher that you don't swallow, who doesn't know how to communicate as from man to man with you, don't let him get away from the literature to which you should be directed.
How did it happen that I became the decoy myself?
I had a very good teacher in the VI-VIII classes.
He has opened my mind to some texts that have spoken to the pub since then to his understanding.
I've met in high school a university professor who opened my library door.
I looked at him as a man from another world: he had walls of the house covered with shackles of books.
I was lost in his library and I wanted to have one as well.
Now I might have it, but if I didn't get it out of my way, I might have decided to make myself a football player.
Or an engineer or a lawyer or who knows what else.
I don't think such meetings are happening.
I don't believe in gambling.
It is essential that you give over to the man who takes your hand and patiently directs you to his vocation.
And this is, most of the time, the professor.
Now, my experience helps me to discuss just what it means to teach literature.
Only the literature can't be delivered.
There's no literature teacher, just like there's a math teacher.
How do you fix the infallible concept?
You can, at most, approach it, without claiming that you transmit petrified truths.
The man from the camp can guide the reading, that's all else.
But above all, you may have some wonderful meetings, between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
There are meetings that can open their minds, which they can pick up, talk to someone, make eyelashes.
Therefore, the professor of literature must first of all be able to make his students understand (he feels) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
On the contrary!
A great coseur, Al. Paleologist, says one thing that seems paradoxical: "How much literature, so much life, not vice versa!" and was right.
That's why, a good record prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in an open area anyway.
Luckily, we always have to learn a few things.
And we, the teachers; or especially the new, the teachers.
Most of the time, it repeats only a great truth from the inertion: not only do students have to learn from their masters, but vice versa.
In an ideal way, the teacher should be a teacher, and the student should be a student.
Which, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
A little bit of it, it's right.
But the master was the one who got the shine.
I don't think there's any greater happiness for a pure blood teacher than to stand up for as many divisions as possible.

If the FIFA is being investigated
The US Justice and Switzerland will undergo new arrests
The US and Swiss authorities have announced that they will start criminal prosecutions in the case of new persons and organisations, in the investigation into FIFA corruption, inform the international press.
US Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced, on Monday, at a press conference organised in Zurich, that the field of research on global football corruption was extended.
"On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence, we will commit additional prosecutions to new individuals and new organizations," Lynch said.
In May, several senior FIFA officials were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been extracted to the United States.
"We have hopes that other prosecuted people will also arrive in the US," Lynch added.
The Prosecutor General of Switzerland, Michael Lauber, also present at the press conference, stated that his institution had committed suicide on several goods, including housing and land in the Alps, as well as on financial assets, in the course of the investigation carried out in collaboration with the US.
"I didn't even get to the end of the first review," said Lauber.
So far, a very large amount of information has been confiscated, 11 terabytes.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are investigated.
In the attention of the investigators, a contract for the award of average rights to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and 2014 - Brazil also entered into.
FIFA faces a major corruption scandal, after the US justice has put 14 people in charge, including two FIFA Vice-Presidents and seven Forum Officials.
Detained persons are researched for bribery and other benefits from the early 1990s and up to now, totaling over 150 million dollars.
Following this scandal, Swiss Joseph Blatter announced, at the beginning of July, that he resigned from the FIFA presidency, after being realized for the fifth time.
Fighting like a movie at the theater
In the Gala Supekombat da Milano, the Catălin Moroşanu will fight with the "beast" James Wilson
A series of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" Cătălin Moroşanu, will take part on 2 October in the Supercombat gala of the Linear 4 Ciak theatre in Milan, the last before the end of November, is shown in a communiqué sent to MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by the atmosphere last year, and as I promised, we'll come back in this autumn with a new five-star gala.
If we're still choosing a spot to do, a theater, then we promise to fight as in movies.
We'll have eight Romanian fighters in the event program.
In addition to the games with already consecrated stars, we will have another gala in the opening, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, including the Romanians Christi Speccu, Cristian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"It will soon be announced and the full programme," said Eduard Irimia.
Cătălin Moroşanu will fight in the Supercombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination gale with American James Wilson, known after participating in the last pyramid in 2012 in the heavy category organised in Japan and the numerous awards from the bodybuilding contests.
I can't wait to fight in Italy.
I've seen Wilson, he's really a beast, but I'm decomposing him!
I'm still angry that last year I couldn't fight in the end, so now I'm going to avenge him.
"In the beast it turns into a cat," said Moroshanu.
In 2015, the Andrei and Bogdan Stoica brothers will have the last confrontations in Italy before fighting for world titles on November 7th in the final sea.
Last year, both of them were imposed by KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the scenario.
I'm happy to be back in Italy, the atmosphere last year was incredible.
"I look forward to meeting with fans from there and I promise them a new show of silence," said Andrei Stoica's world champion.
Raul Cătinaş will also fight with an opponent to be established in Milan.
A little girl invited the Queen of England to her day, but she also argued in writing
A British girl sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to attend her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen for the longest gentleman, but did not forget to mention the fact that she was not allowed access to the Buckingham Palace when she went to visit him along with his family.
The writing was not left without an echo, but the girl received a reply from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked her for her invitation, but she also apologized for not being able to be present on 27 September, so she even hated her having fun with family and friends.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together to a talk show shortly before the poet Adrian Păunescu died.
Both writers died of heart.
The fate of Adrian Păunescu and of Vadim Tudor is similar.
Both were writers and politicians, and they both turned to an approaching age, heart.
Adrian Păunescu at 67, Vadim Tudor at 65.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Păunescu died, at a TV reality station.
Vervadim Tudor has ironied Gheorghe Flutur and criticised Elena Udrea, Minister of Tourism since then, for the situation of Romanian tourism.
At one point, Vadim Tudor said, with a smile on his jokes, to Adrian Păunescu: "I envy your posthumous glory, Adrian."
He smiled and said to him, "It's not too flattering what you told me right now."
Adrian Păunescu died on November 5, 2010, at the age of 67.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor died today, September 14, 2015, at 65 years of age.
Two INSTRUCTIONS After an ACCIDENT in Dumbrava
An accident took place Monday night around 19:00 in the Dumbrava village of Iaşi County.
A biker was taken up by a Volkswagen bus.
The cyclist was not observed by the driver.
Luckily, they're both stable.
As a result of the impact, the parking and mirroring of the cars were broken.
Two injured persons are unconscious at the time of transmission of this news.
A SMURD team is on its way to provide medical assistance to victims and to transport them to the hospital.
The cops are on the spot.
A Syrian artist turned "Super Mario" into a refugee
A Syrian artist created a version of the popular game "Super Mario", which evokes the harsh situation of his compatriots on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of the Italian installer Mario in the Kingdom of Cyprus, the modified video game has centred on the "Mario Refugee".
The person is trying to get people traffickers and border police, on his way to a refugee centre in the European Union.
The artist established in Istanbul uses the pseudonym Samir al-Mufti for security reasons and says he made the video game with Mario after his friends took a dangerous trip to Europe to escape the horrors of war.
The youngest student at Craiova Prison Centre is 15 and is in class I
Minister of Justice Robert Cazanciuc said, at the opening of the school year at the Craiova Detention Centre, that the youngest student is 15 and is in class I, and the greatest is 25 and is in class XI, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I chose to participate in the opening of the school year in a centre belonging to the National Prisoners' Administration to try to attract attention, and in this way, on less known realities.
The youngest student, at the age of 15, is enrolled in class I, and the eldest is 25 and is enrolled in class XI.
"There are complicated issues that society is concerned about at this moment, we are all overwhelmed by our own concerns and problems, but we do not need to pass on the lesson that these over 100 young people from the Craiova Detention Centre offer," said Minister Robert Cazanciuc on Monday to the opening of the school year.
The Minister of Justice drew attention to the fact that the lack of education, motivated in many cases by the lack of material opportunities, may lead to tragedies, specifying that young people in this centre would have another chance in life if they could follow the gay school course of any child, if they had had the opportunity to learn not only to write, read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to know what compliance with the law and what consequences it might have had.
"The role of the prison system is not that of permanent isolation of the people who have violated the law, of closing them behind high walls, but that of trying to re-edit them and prepare them, because when they return to the middle of the community they have more chance of reintegration," Cazanciec added.
The Minister pointed out that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investment must also be made in the prison system, because, in many cases, conditions of detention are limited to humanity and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to talk about the reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and because of this partnership, every year, in the prison system, there are over 2000 graduates of school education.
Obviously, we won't be able to change overnight what hasn't been done for 25 years, but it's important steps that we do.
"In all these acts we need the support of society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we are doing our duty, that by your work these young people have a chance and do not pose a danger to society," Cazanciec said.
The Minister of Justice has succeeded both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the joint effort of all.
"And because today is the celebration of the exaltation of the Holy Cross, I would launch an invitation to all students and teachers to visit the mausoleums from the Soviet Union, the Great and not only to understand what it means to fight young people for ideals," said Robert Cazanciuc.
A Russian came to the vote with the bear
Doctoral schools caught with two plagiarisms to be dismissed!
Request of prestigious university students in Iaşi and the country
Over 200 researchers, academics, personalities and students from the country signed a petition launched by the Romanian Academic Society calling for the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research to evaluate, sanction and even disarm the academic schools in Romania "which allows and promotes academic taxation".
Among the signatories to the petition launched on 10 September are also the teaching framework and teachers in Iaşi.
Among the university's signatories to the petition from the academic environment is, for example, Prof. Liviu Antonesei.
At the national level, the petition has names from former ministers of Education, such as Mircea Micela, to people of culture who are also academic frameworks such as Andrei Plesu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pipidi.
"Although the Education Law provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not been achieved so far, thus determining the lack of specific sanctions for doctoral schools that flammablely violate the ethical standards of scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognised performance," the petition stated.
That request specifically requires compliance with the National Education Act, evaluation of doctoral schools, suspension of the right to work for any doctoral school where more than two plagiarisms have been found, until the assessment and remedy of the situation.
The last requirement is to suspend the right to work for any doctoral school in which there are no minimum number of doctorate managers provided for by law to meet the criteria imposed by the National Scientific Research Council in 2011 for eligibility for IDEI type project grants.
Do you respect a doctorate general, or a politician, or an information agent in the Middle East?
"Why is there no other academy in Europe to give doctors organised by secret services, and the top soldiers who give their doctorate to autonomous academic institutions, where the quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungui-Pipidi, president of the Romanian Academic Society, initiator of the petition, and her from Iasi.
This can be completed by all applicants on the Company's website, and the final signatures will be submitted by organization to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, but 10,000 who want to get involved.
The "Pentru Iași" party, founded by young IT managers, was launched elsewhere in the Copou Park.
The president of the "Pentru Iași" Initiative Group gave an interview to the "Iaşi Journal"
The valley will have a dedicated party exclusively for the development of the city.
A group of non-political entrepreneurs and managers has so far launched at the end of last week's party for Iasi organisation that will propose candidates for the 2016 local elections.
Currently, the party core is composed of IT specialists, but training initiators say that everyone in the organization is welcome who wants to be involved in modernising the city.
The launch took place on Saturday in Copou Park, and the event took place more than 200 sympathizers, almost all being young.
The special invitation of the action was Nisúsor Dan, president of the Saved Association Bucharest.
He was surprised at the 2012 local elections when, from the independent position, he managed to gather 10% of the joy votes for the capital's primary function.
"The people I saw at "Pentru Iaşi" think they are very good to access the public administration of the Iaş."
I believe in this initiative, I think it has a chance, I think it can have more chances in a community smaller than that in Bucharest.
"I'll be with you all the time," said Nisushor Dan.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Iasi to work in an IT company abroad?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are rather sentimental and emotional.
I've been gone on many short business trips, I've lived a year in Cluj.
I came back every time, because I felt here is my house.
ZDI: Why did you now decide to set up a political party?
Andrei Postolache:Now we're also at a certain maturity, we're a group of people that we've been getting to know each other for a while.
We met in professional contexts, we started discussing how we could get involved.
At first, we were more timid, in smaller things, with NGOs projects, various building or charity actions, and, in some cases, things have evolved natural and organic and now it has happened to be the moment when we reached the decision that we need to involve ourselves more than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects for the efficiency of local public administration activity!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of minimum information on the activity of primary care so that different departments, institutions and regions can cooperate as best as possible.
But more importantly, you can publish transparent data on the activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects, etc. We are talking about information organization.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a certain neighborhood, public consultation of the affected people is important.
If we talk about efficiency, we don't have to forget the transport in common, we have the worst buses in the country.
You need to buy new means of transport.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city is extremely large.
How would you promote the Ice?
Andrei Postolache: Get on the plane and look for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industrial events where you can "sell" the city.
You must want to do this and know to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we bring customers to Iasi.
ZDI: What's the brand of the ice?
Andrei Postolache: My opinion is that we need to be a city of technology in some way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we need to expand it, go to medicine, enter the robotic area, into 3D printing, continue in this spirit and join such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I'm referring here to the city's modern brand.
Of course, the island already has a historic brand that must not be changed, that is, cultural city.
I see both elements in balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for the lack of experience in public administration, as well as the lack of traditional party structures that still win elections in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: Administration is a form of management, which means organizing, planning, communicating, working with people and delivering projects.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we're gonna talk to everyone, we're not just staying on Facebook, we're not online.
We don't want to have volunteers brought by bus.
That means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think they're quite people like that.
ZDI: Should the Prime Minister be more concerned about promoting the image of the city at national and international level, or is it necessary that the area of concern be permanently building?
Andrei Postolache: One without another doesn't work.
First of all, you need to solve today's problems, emergency.
Or, if you don't make the known city, if you don't attract money in the city, at a given time you're without money and you won't be able to do, for example, street.
You have to do both at the same time and you have to have competent people next to you.
The mayor doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the model of the father-tub, which comes and beats with the punch in the table and solves everything.
No, no, no.
We're a team.
The principal is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract business people from the IT area who can support the party financially?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something good, have a reputation, be clear and honorable.
From this point of view, we don't have any other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or why not, 300,000, who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for almost 15 years.

The company set up by another IT specialist provides management consulting services.
Rabla tractor program proved to be a failure
The Director-General of SC IRUM SA Reghin, Mircea Oltian, stated that the programme to stimulate the renewal of the national park of tractors and agricultural cars, initiated in 2011, also named Rabla for tractors, was a failure due to bureaucracy.
Regarding the Rabla programme, there have been some attempts in recent years, but it has been proved to be a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a farmer, and the approvals were too long and then the world gave up.
That program managed to sell it somewhere in 10 pieces.
"The need for tractors for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces," Mircea Oltean said.
According to this, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces several hundred tractors each year, being the largest in Romania, and that great competition is exercised by companies from abroad, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It is a very great competition with those coming out, all world producers have looked at Romania, know these things I told you, and have special policies.
"In all trades there is a large aggregate, all producers exhibit, come with all sorts of variants," said Mircea Oltean, who pointed out that IRUM Reghin produces around 500 agricultural tractors and forest tractors annually.
By the Rabla tractor programme, initiated in 2011, those who owned old tractors or other self-propelled vehicles, such as combinations, could sell and first exchange a valuable 17,000 lei ticket.
The red flag has risen
The interior of the labs seems more spectacular and more significant political, as the new elected leader automatically becomes its launch peak in the future elections.
Upstairs, therefore, the red-and-white flag/ Under its traps we will live and die.
That's what Jeremy Corbyn sang yesterday in the London Shrine House.
There's been a lot of facts and swearing/ Let's not change the color now.
Citizens who do not know the melodic line of this unofficial British and international left-wing immunization (The Red Flag) can search it online and would not be excluded from a surprise.
With the heads discovered, let's all swear that we'll wear it until we break.
The author of these orders is not at all an admirer of the red flags (and of those who fly them), but respect the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn manages to connect the left of yesterday with that of tomorrow, this love story between him and the Labour Party base will be part of a happy-end.
I don't think it will happen that way, but it seems to me premature to talk about the great and inevitable electoral defeat, over five years, of an elected leader.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have witnessed a democratic exercise of an impressive range.
Not British laborers invented the direct voting system for the party leader, on the left-hand side.
French socialists have been practicing a more complicated system, based on motivations, which allows the expression of all members and sympathians; in addition, they have organised a preliminary competition for the nomination of the candidate to the presidential of 2012.
However, the internal polling of the labs seems more spectacular and significant political, as the new elected leader automatically becomes its launch peak in the future elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of a political system, personalizing power by being more pronounced in the UK than the rest of the Channel.
In addition, participation in the vote was great in all three "circumstances": members of their own, trade unions and other affiliated organisations and, finally, the group of supporters (who received the ballot card after a summary registration procedure).
This last group provides us with interesting information on the perceptions of left-hand segments of British society, especially those who are young or middle-aged, educated, interested in political phenomena.
Many of them will choose to involve themselves more, in the future, just because of the signal offered by Corbyn's victory.
There are, as far as I know, sociological investigations that tell us too much about the attitudes of this "outer circle" laborist, so careful speculation is allowed.
I think we meet quite similar attitudes to those of the Podemos (Spain) fellows or even SYRIZA (Greece), noting that they will cross the traditional left channels.
If we are to identify a "antistism", it first reflects itself by rejecting the centralist line, New Labour (for many, only a dissimulated form of the multi-hulit thatcherism).
The second component would be the repudiation of the leaders considered to be guilty of the two successful electoral failures, one of the arguments being that they did not go left enough, that they were not firmly delimited by Tony Blair's time.
The second reper - after me, and more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum on Scotland's independence.
If we are abstracting the separatist message and focusing strictly on aspirations for other political themes, we see that Scottish nationalists have captured the energies of public segments that favour the social state and are motivated by the ambition of equity, adequate disarmament and the hostility of military involvement over decision-making, but still sensitive to the new themes of left: ecology, gene, assistance for poor countries.
Scottish laborers have thus lost an electorate to which they should at least have privileged access, but which they can now recover (see their enthusiasm for Corbyn's campaign).
The same energy exists all over the United Kingdom, but the old leadership couldn't attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his reputation as an outsider, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, "Aristocrates" alaborist.
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I think, than the left-wing anti-system in southern Europe.
The term "anti-system" is too hard: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
Until next week we'll find out more about Jeremy Corbyn's first steps as opposition leader.
We'll see if there's some red Steagle in the House of Commons (it wouldn't be for the first time), after the new leader has taken his place, first of all the opposition banks.
Anyway, what Jeremy Corbyn now wants from his colleagues in Parliament is first of all unity - and in this respect he has reason to be concerned.
Unscientific or unscientific manipulation trap
While I wrote the article, I went through my head to check on the story of the former fighter and the "syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" who became part of the second space dedicated by V. Marin to his "jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in itself make me from the beginning of the circumspect).
I didn't.
In last week's article (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") I commented in parallel with two pictures - the one with the boy Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean coast and the one, in fact: the two looking at Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, twice as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh was taken from the article "The Syrian Fighters come with the Valley of Refugees" (signified by Viorica Marin in the truth of September 3rd).
Monday night, I put a link to my article on my Facebook page.
Tuesday, entering Facebook, we found, among other things, a shot by a friend (not only by FB) Marius Cristian: "Subscription, but a clarification. Laith al Salah is not a jihadist".
On the contrary, he is fighting against Al Assad for democracy and that one.
"So you could also add the grossolana manipulation in the table"!
I have to admit, I felt naked.
The more I wrote the article, the more I went through the network to check the story of the former fighter and the "syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" who became part of the second space dedicated by V. Marin to his person "Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in themselves make me from the beginning of the circumspect.
Because I had confidence in the truth, in his journalists.
On the spot, I didn't have another comment on Marius Cristian's pull than that: "That's what I need if I have faith in the truth"
After that, I obviously took the big money and I owe it to the readers with the correct presentation of the Syrian story Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest we found in an Associated Press material (Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe - Syrian rebel leader seeking Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett from 17 August 2015 on the island of Kos in Greece, where they noticed, among the hundreds, thousands of refugees, on a man who was trying to order in the chaos of the majority.
The man was Syrian destroyer Laith Al-Saleh of Aleppo who "was used to be in command", while he "runed a unit of 700 rebels in the civil war in Syria".
We also find that at the age of 30, Al-Saleh had "a house, a wife and a normal life before starting a struggle that cost more than 250,000 lives and set a third of the population of Syria on the road".
In an interview with the correspondents at Associated Press, Al-Saleh tells that "everybody wants to leave Syria."
My town is the most dangerous cities in the world.
About 70% of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (an extremist group of the Islamic State) wants me, the government wants me to fight everyone.
In addition to being thrown out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have been offered "a meeting and more sinister - with a man who recognized an enemy Syrian": "Now two days, I have seen a lunetist from the government forces."
I haven't spoken to him, but I'm still very upset.
We find out more from the material that Laith (meaning lion in Arabic) was really on his way to the Netherlands, where he had a cousin - a senior officer in the Syrian army and then he became a rebel and arrived in the West after he was seriously injured - hoping to get asylum and be able to bring his family - the wife and a three-year-old boy (nearly an old man with the civil war in Syria, which exploded in March 2011).
After this has been accomplished, Laith Al-Saleh would not have been excluded from a return to Syria to continue fighting for the Syrian Free Army (as a result of the West) - against three forces: President Bashar Assad's army (as a result of the Russians), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
A madness - whoever wants freedom must fight in Syria not one enemy but three!
I've been over a Serbian material since August 22, of which I didn't understand much, just that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come along with migrants: TERRORISTS ARE KRIJA IN MIGRANTIMA sounds the title of a news from http://www.telegraf.rs/ves, in which they are accompanied by a picture with Al Saleh with a beard holding a Syrian flag in his hand and that of the refugee wearing the shirt with "THANK YOU".
On 7 September, then, himself on the BBC site, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of handling photos with the Syrian fighter: This viral photo fakely claims to show an IS figure posing as a refugee - This viral picture claims to be wrong to see an Islamic State fighter posted in a refugee.
We find that the picture (in fact: the photos - the one with Laith with the beard and the gun and the one with the THANK YOU shirt) was posted by a user on Facebook, who would have asked for forgiveness in the meantime.
Just before that, just on his wall, the picture with the two pictures would have been taken more than 70,000 times, collecting a few thousand comments.
That word, too late, the horse's gone!
In Romania, on 9 September Carla Dinu from Hotnews took the story with the manipulation of BBC, but the title was wrong: "A fake photo became viral shows an ISIS fighter giving herself as a refugee."
Obviously, the photograph is not false, but the interpretation was a false, wrong, short: manipulation.
Champion at 21 years of age
The winner in the Iaş Valley, Simone Tempestini secured his national title to the races, becoming the youngest winner in the history of the championship
The 2015 Cotnari Rally ended with a result of the young pilot Simone Tempestini, Italian with Romanian citizenship, who, at the age of 21, won all the new special samples of the most difficult stages of the National Rally Championship.
