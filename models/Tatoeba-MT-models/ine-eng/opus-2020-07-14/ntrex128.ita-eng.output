Members of the Galles Assembly are concerned about "making the figure of the bats"
There is a consensus among some members of the House on the proposal to amend their title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Wales Parliament).
This proposal is as a result of the programmes to amend the name of the Assembly in the House of Wales.
The members of the whole political arena Assembly are concerned that this can be ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party is concerned that "may make room with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who do not live in Wales: In Wales, twp means cretin and pwp means cacca.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group in the complex "was not satisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative party stated that he was "open" to the change of name, but stressed that only a small verbal step apart from MWP from Muppet (pagliaccio).
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is spoken in a similar way to the English word of the Yorkshire letter U.
The committee of the Assembly, which is currently taking the lead in introducing amendments to the names, said: "The final decision on possible descriptors of what will be called the members of the House will obviously be a debate for the members themselves."
The Law of the Wales Government of 2017 granted the Gales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which has registered a broad support for the possibility of calling the House of Wales.
As regards the title of the members of the House, the Commission has expressed its preference for Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Member of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option has received greater consent in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could be a compliment to President Elin Jones, who should present a legislative proposal on the amendments within a few weeks.
The law on reforms will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will have the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians refer to the referendum on the change of country name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change the name of their country in "the Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was organised in an attempt to put an end to a dispute for decades with the bordering Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
It has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov, an opposer of the plebiscite for the amendment of the name, said that it would not take account of the result of the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is simply the price to be paid in order to be able to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells sit while Harlem's churches are in trouble
"The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," Adams said.
"There are no two today."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are socializing differently today," she explained.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood rooms that people regularly attend."
As for the churches, worry is that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will come back where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by buildings of apartments with condoms filled with the kind of people who will not help the rest of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and for this reason they will rush the time when these churches will close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by confraterites before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The initial white Methodist congregation went on in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation with the commander John Howard Johnson, who led the boycotting against the 125th Street vendors, one of the main streets for shopping in Harlem, who refused to take or promote people of color.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners planned his reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the "the campaigns of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it in a different way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a colour musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who passed to a larger carillon to the church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace it.
What was staged at St. Martin's in the last months was a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by the secular leaders of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, which is a secular leader, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns about the fact that the diocese "try to download the costs" on the parish assembly, although this was not involved in the acquisition of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Squalo poisons a 13th-century humming fish aragos in California
Official sources say that on Saturday a squad attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while he was immersing in the search for Aragos in California, during the opening day of the Aragos season.
The attack occurred shortly before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was immersing himself with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming and swimming up to him with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was only enthusiasm because of the capture of an aragast but then "he realized that the boy was shouting ‘I was bitten!
I've been bitten!'
Her entire clavicle was loose," said Hammel once reached the boy.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' Hammel added.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the Council of Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was recovered under critical conditions.
The species of the responsible attack squad is not known.
The guard Captain Larry Giles declared during a communication to the media that some weeks earlier he had been sighted in the area a shark, but that he had been declared not belonging to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torace area.
The authorities have forbidden access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablanca to Swami's to Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning a push towards the beauty sector in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with courses dedicated to the beauty products of the large warehouse dedicated to specialized assistants
As part of the important push towards the beauty market of 2.8 billion sterling products in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and household items decrease, the biggest beauty products courses will be tested in 11 shops in the country and adopted in more shops next year in case of success.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting for new ways to use space on drawers once dedicated to televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double the size of its beauty item offer to reach the 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of boutique tricks so that most of the products are vegan - an ever-increasing quality required by the younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance dealer The Fragrance Shop will experience the authorizations in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened to Croydon, in southern London, while a second will open to Shelly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Online shopping and a move towards buying small quantities of food daily at small neighborhood shops have forced supermarkets to commit themselves more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, said that the points sold will be more and more similar to large stores while the chain of supermarkets tries to oppose resistance to discounts such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and has also introduced different Habitats since he bought the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy has given rise to food sales and made the most profitable acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reduce beauty and pharmaceutical products to its distributions ended in an accident.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenue from pharmaceutical sales points in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold three years ago its pharmaceutical activity of 281 points sold in Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million sterlings.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four stores of a wide range of luxury brand for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our beauty product departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specifically trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to respond to all needs and the inviting environment and comfortable positions make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way to shopping."
Peter Jones "frustible" after Holly Willoughby gets out of an 11 million sterling deal.
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones is furious after the TV viewer Holly Willoughby withdrew from a contract of 11 million sterlings with its trend brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of household and Truly accessories anymore.
The couple's activity was compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow's.
The presenter of this Morning, 37 years old, appealed to Instagram to announce his abandonment.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, furious after being withdrawn from their profit-making branding activity at the last minute to focus on his new exceptional contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "furished" when the golden girl of the TV admitted during a teasing meeting at the headquarters of her commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - for a value of 1.5 million sterlings - did not leave them enough time to devote themselves to their brand of household and accessories True.
The activity was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop's Goop's Goop's Goop's Goop, and it was calculated that it would double the Willoughby's property, estimated around 11 million sterlings.
Not only willoughby, 37 years old, chose Instagram to announce his abandonment of True, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday residences.
According to one source, "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's highest priority.
It had to be its future over the long term that it would have been engaged in for the next twenty years.
His decision to abandon has left all the people involved absolutely without words.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow's headquarters, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that abandoning this presentation of this Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions because of the strong investments in products that go from pillows and household candles and because of possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby designed True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, came to be part of the company as president in March.
The couples spent their holidays together and Jones has a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as a guest of the ITV "I'm A Celebrity".
A source near Jones said last night that "he does not want to comment on his business."
Hard words and "then we're in love"
He complained about the criticism he would have received from the media to make a comment that some would have judged "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "telegraph driver".
"I didn't give up on anything."
He stressed that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first incident in Singapore in June was called up by Trump as a huge step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearisation are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders during the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, that North Korea did not observe an "equivalent" response from the United States to the first disarmament operations in North Korea.
On the contrary, he stressed that the United States is continuing to impose sanctions to maintain high pressure.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea we are getting good results," he said.
"We were about to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We now have this excellent report."
He stated that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: the end of the missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the return of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be Presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded field, we would have about 200 people right here," said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, causing hundreds of victims
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, non-governmental organizations were reported that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had been displaced, the national emergency was not declared, an essential requirement for the activation of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a little complicated," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Suddenly, spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Considering the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly subjected, the country continues to be terribly impatient in the face of the wrath of nature.
Although shelters have been built at the tsunamis in Aceh, this is not a common structure on other costs.
The apparent lack of an alarm siren for the tsunamis in Palu, although the alarm was given, has probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
In the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, but there will be at least three days to reach the place of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo put the improvement of Indonesia's brand infrastructure at the centre of his election campaign and turned money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds hit the administration of Joko while preparing for re-election next year.
Joko also has to face pressures from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
Over 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands away from their homes because of clashes on the streets between Christian gangs and Muslims, who fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimental weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge del Liverpool paired against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League against Chelsea at a point at 89 minutes on Saturday, in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 metres from the Chelsea gate, with his team below for 1-0.
He hit the left ball before he pulled on the second ball.
The attempt went high above the door frame while turning to the top right corner of the network.
The ball finally fell to the back of Kepa Arrizabalaga by falling into the net.
"I was just trying to put myself in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante arrive and I got a touch and I didn't think too much and I pulled it off."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the goal at 25 minutes marked by the star of Belgium Eden Hazard.
The Blue Center has passed by taco to Mateo Kovacic before skiing near the midfield and jumping in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick half-way.
So he took a beautiful walk that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard has overcome the defense and ended up on the second floor with a left goal beyond Alison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Naples in the round phase of the Champions League at 3 pm on Wednesday at the St. Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will have to face the videoton in UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of Tsunami victims in Indonesia comes to 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunami victims in Indonesia arrived at 832, the agency responsible for managing the country's disasters declared on Sunday morning.
A number of people were reported to be interpolated between the macerias of the buildings crashed after the magnitude earthquake 7.5 that hit the country on Friday and that generated high waves up to 6 meters, reported the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been spared losses from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman is beaten to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, in the Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 in the morning with gun wounds in Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police have invited people who may have seen or heard something in the area to contact.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just at the beginning, but I would like to appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious and invited them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, in particular to taxists, who might have recorded something on Dashcam, so that you can contact us so that you can have very important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was found within a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman came to the scene of the crime to ask questions about the place of birth this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have stated that they are currently informing the victims' families.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He ran out of words when he found out what had happened.
The residents were informed that they would want us hours before they were allowed to come back.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police trucks were inside the border area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were within the limited area by controlling the apartment building.
Anyone who has information about it is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 indicating the register 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the wave of "historic writing"
His removal would be poetic justice for his tabbana destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England executed by his fanatics following Puritans.
But the Cromwell Society has defined Crick's proposal as a "follie" and a "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace became a goal.
The iconoclasty during the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is the proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the story of a figure that many think should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
This is an extremely accurate representation which is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the 17th century has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure that represents a part of this fracture.
Its results as Lord's protector must be celebrated and remembered."
A Chinese farmer kills him by killing him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in south-western China by local media.
The man, identified only with the name "Yuan", was found dead with a cold artery, covered with blood near a pig to the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject pigs in a pig breed on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai in China.
It is reported that he had travelled with the cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 May to the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pighouse with blood on the mouse.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the breast of 250 kg had decomposed the hairdresser, standing in the declaration.
"My cousin's legs were covered with blood and masculine," said the cousin identified with the surname "Wu", as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or the cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent other people from attacking, while the police collect evidence on the crime scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating a reimbursement for the death of the kidnapper.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, causing a series of injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 300 kg pig incapacitated a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to kick the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can work as "catalizer."
"They just want to play.
They're playful, very curious... they don't want to hurt.
Just show them the right dose of respect," he explained.
The ruins of the Red Hurricane will carry strong extensive rains in the south-west of the United States
As expected, the hurricane Rosa is losing power while moving on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains on North Mexico and the South-West coast of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa recorded 20 to 138 km/h, an hurricane of category 1, at 5 ET on Sunday and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a shackle on the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the western coast of the USA. While Rosa is approaching the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm, she will start to push a strong tropical humidity towards the north, in the south-west part of the USA.
Rosa will carry up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during the day of Monday.
So the tropical humidity in contact with the nearby shackling will create heavy and wide precipitation in the south-west area in the next few days.
At local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, torrents of waste and possible free in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour in some points, especially in the areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitations of 2,5-10 cm of rain are planned in some areas of the south-west, particularly on much of Arizona.
There may be sudden floods with rapid deterioration due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It strongly recommends that you take a walk in the desert in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
The strong rains could make the canyons of the rivers full and the season will bring wind to buffs and lift dust.
The nearby drought will cause strong local rains on the coast of southern California.
Precipitation of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flow of debris and bulky loads.
This would be the first rush of the region in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the rains become more extensive at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Strong rains will descend on the Four Corners Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong temperatures fluctuations on the USA while the Arctic is cooling, but the tropicals will remain warm enough.
Sometimes this leads to significant temperature changes on short distances.
An exceptional example of sensitive temperature differences in central USA will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining heat of the summer will try to increase and expand again.
A warm beginning of October is expected for most of the Central and Eastern USA, with 26 oC from the Southern Plains to the north-east areas.
New York will be able to reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, i.e. a temperature of about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecasts indicate high probability of temperatures above average for the Eastern USA until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people followed on Thursday on six television networks the upcoming deposit by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would happen in the '80s, Christine Blasey Ford.
In the meantime, the political impasse continues, with the issuers that interrupt regular programming for a Friday's last minute: an agreement designed by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake so that the FBI will conduct a week's investigation of the charges.
Ford informed the Senate Justice Commission that it was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had beaten her in a state of pregnancy and tried to tear her apart during a party to the superiors.
Kavanaugh, during an inflamed deposit, claimed to be 100% sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday followed the deposit.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty counting the viewers who follow the programs in the offices.
To put it all in perspective, this is a hearing similar to that for a football playoff game or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, guided all networks, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the entire day's hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the drama on Friday.
After the Office of the moderate Republican issued a statement stating that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was arrested by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning while being insulted by demonstrators while trying to take an elevator to a hearing by the Justice Commission.
He remained with his eyes down for several minutes while he was re-evaluated and sent live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "He has power while many women are powerless."
Flake stated that his office had issued the statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he would have had other things to say during the committee's hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters were sent live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present the appointment of Kavanaugh to the whole Senate for a vote.
But Flake said that he would only do so with the certainty that the FBI would have analysed the charges against the candidate during the following week, as required by the minority democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by discussions with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have voted to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticised his programmes of letting the European Union "political action" with the future of Britain and reiterated national interest in an interview with the daily Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the Prime Minister on the first page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers Agreement for Brexit, claiming that a proposal that Britain and the EU must recover their duties is "incredibly ridiculous"
Wayde Sims Murder: Police arrests the suspect of the player's death of LSU Dyteon Simpson
The police arrested a suspect of the death of Wayde Sims firearms, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned on second-degree murder charges, said Baton Rouge's police department.
The authorities have made a video of the match between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB TV station affiliated to the CBS.
After asking Simpson, the police said the suspect admitted to having accidentally shot Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported it.
The office of the legal doctor of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death is a firearm wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the task force for the fugitives of the Louisiana State Police, the police science lab, the South University Police and the people of the area who assisted the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of the LSU thanked the forces of the order of the area for their commitment and the search for justice."
Yess was 20 years old.
The 198 cm attack grew in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5,6 points and 2,6 2,6 returns to match.
On Friday morning, LSU's coach Will Wade said the team was "distorted" and "shocked" for Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about at any time," Wade said.
Vulcan ashes savings Mexico City
The ashes out of the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity was increased in the crater and 183 gas and ashes were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was controlling the various rubies and scissors.
Images on the social media have shown thin layers of ashes that cover the parabridities of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano corresponding to 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since a magnitude earthquake 7.1 hit the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police fights with Catalan separatists on the wake of the voting anniversary for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-independence demonstrators met with the police's anti-subsoms and thousands of people joined opposition demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on the secession.
A group of separatists masked by the antisomb police targeted the police with eggs and threw paints to powder, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that usually disturb tourists.
Further collisions occurred during the day with police officers who used manganese to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independents who sang "We won't forget, we won't forgive" were confronted by the unionist demonstrators who called "Long Life to Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to receive treatment for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
The tension remained high in the independent region one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by the Madrid government but recognized by the Catalan separatists.
The electors had voted with a overwhelming majority for independence, although the fluence was low, and the Catalans opposed the secession had greatly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people reported injuries last year after the police tried to stop with violent clashes the referendum that was taking place throughout the region.
Independent groups met on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said that he had no more hopes of the possibility that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I have seen my parents cry with joy for the possibility of voting, but now everything is blocked," he explained.
Despite having achieved a fundamental victory despite measures to the regional elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have made it difficult to maintain the slowdown this year, with many of the most well-known leaders of the movement who find themselves in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who registered with his phone the police support protest, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians of the two factions.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison waiting for trial from the end of last year, announced that he will be elected by the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the implication of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after the explosion of a house with a car
Three men, from 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after having a car repeatedly kicked against a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, at around 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and to the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a bullet at a certain point.
Menga's attack marks the victory of Livingston 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingstone signed the victory
Livingston has already promoted the Rangers with Steven Gerrard back to his second defeat in 18 games as director of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference while Gary Holt's team went to the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team therefore remains without a victory out of the house in the Premiership this season and will have to face the first in the Hearts class next Sunday, from which they will be separated by 8 points.
On Thursday the Rangers hosted the Rapid Vienna in Europe League.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues its series of victories in the division remaining battled for six games, with the Holt coach who still has to see a defeat since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against the few incisive guests
Holt's team should have been in favour before the goal, with their immediateness that caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson found out but pulled his action in front of the mirror of the door and Alan Lithgow could only walk out the door after being inserted to meet Craig Halket's headshot on the other side of the door.
The guests agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could have put the visitors in difficulty with square shoes.
And it was so that the crucial goal was realized.
The Rangers have granted a fine and Livingston has found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson have succeeded in moving to Menga, which could have signaled from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession but the defense of the host team had proved impenetrable and Porter Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This scheme was maintained during the second time, although Alfredo Morelos had committed Kelly to a stop.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped by the feet of the Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow's ranger shot out of another Livingstone game scheme.
Crosses occurred in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two demands of rigour, after Halkett's contrast with Glenn Middleton's replacement and one by hand, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to overcome expectations along this exceptional trail.
Their game style and employees have changed little since they returned to the maximum series, but it is necessary to give Holt a lot of credit for how he managed to break the team from his arrival.
He's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, in charge of a masterly organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble during the game.
The Rangers, however, were little inspired.
Despite the excellent performances at some times with Gerrard, in this case they have gone well below these standards.
The last passage is missing - only once they have been able to penetrate the opposing area - and you can consider an alarm bell for the Rangers, which are half-class.
Erdogan received with contrasting reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skys on Saturday (29 September) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of the controversial visit to Germany by President Erdogan, in order to distance relations between NATO allies.
There have been conflicts on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan therefore turned to Cologne for the inauguration of a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest group of Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have for security reasons motivated the intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters have come near to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have made their voice heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept it in the country.
The protests reflect the dissertation caused by a visitor considered a hero by some German Turks and called a deposit by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies against a car
A cyclist died in the fight with a car in London.
The incident occurred near the intersection between Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a trafficked road from Deptford, in the south-east area of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the man died on the hit.
The incident occurred months after another cyclist died, invested by a street pirate in Childers Street, about a mile from where the incident happened on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads and buses were blocked, and car drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six wounded guards during a disorder
Six prison guards were injured during an accident at the maximum security men's prison, he reported to the prison office.
The tumor was discovered at Long Lartin's maximum safety men's prison in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST about Sunday and is still in progress.
Specialized agents "Torado" have been used to manage the riot, which involves eight prisoners and is confined to a prison hall.
Agents were treated on the spot for slight facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the prison service said: "The specially trained personal prison was provided to contain an incident currently under way at Long Lartin's prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons, and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer prison sentence."
The Long Lartin prison hosts over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison manager had to receive hospital care following the attack of a prisoner.
And in October last year, the anti-sumbing agents were called to intervene in prison to realize a violent storm during which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
The Uruguayan Rosa threat Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (of which the areas affected by drought might benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression hit Arizona, but it is exactly what will happen at the beginning of next week when the last energy of the hurricane Rosa will pass through the south-west of the desert, creating risks of sudden flooding.
The national weather service has already issued a wave of sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona to the south and east Nevada, South-West California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will direct herself on Phoenix Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with rains.
Phoenix's national weather service reported on a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Centre for Hurricanes provide precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west area, including central rocky mountains and Great Basin, will receive 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For foreign areas at the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these precipitations are likely to be positive because the south-west area is currently going through a period of drought.
Standing at the drought monitoring centre, little more than 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
At first, the path of the hurricane Rosa will be able to stop to the ground through the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, who still maintained the hurricane force Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will deal with the coldest waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected that he will arrive in Mexico with a tropical storm force in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday.
Precipitation on parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitation is expected between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the north-west area of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a tropical depression state, so to go through Arizona and south Utah in the afternoon of Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or her scissors are intense precipitation in Baja California, in the north-west area of Sonora and in the south-west desert area of the USA," the National Centre for Hurricane.
These rains are expected to generate potentially sudden flooding and desert streams in the deserts, as well as free on mountainlands.
Midsomer Norton's aggression: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man were suspected of attempted murder after a sedentary was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 04:00 BST about Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital where he remained in stable conditions.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, reported the Avon and Somerset police.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who can have picked up what happened with the phone.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh "has suffered for captivity and anger" of the democratic party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the harsh and offensive tactics of the democratic party," Trump said during a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump has stated that Kavanaugh has "suffered for the captivity and anger" of the democratic party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh filed before the Congress on Thursday, denying in a passionate way the charges of Christine Blasey Ford of sexual violence against her decades ago when she was still a teenager.
Ford also appealed to the hearing defending the charge.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people were able to observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most expert minds of our time, a lawyer with unprecedented record in the public service," he said in front of the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh by referring to the importance of republican affluence to the midterm elections.
"At five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I really do," he said.
"For this battle strictly for exceptional candidates."
Trump has stated that the Democrats are committed to "resist and obstruct."
The first substantive procedural vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place not later than Friday, as CNN has declared an assistant senior to the GOP.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia and tsunamis, and the numbers of victims continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many scattered away by giant waves that fell on the beaches, when a earthquake of great magnitude and a tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu Friday, when high waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) fell on the beach at the crossroads, breaking through many people killing them and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami followed a magnitude earthquake 7.5.
"When the threat of tsunamis appeared yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and they were not running away immediately, thus becoming victims," said Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian agency for the control of BNPB disasters.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged with itself cars, trunks, houses, hit anything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved to the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people are walking on trees to escape the tsunami and are survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Agency for Disasters have shown numerous destroyed buildings and shops, fenced bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The ambush shots continued to shoot the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was perceived in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by the high earthquake on Friday was almost 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have strengthened the size of the tsunami, said.
Nugroho described the damage as "estes" and claimed that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels are collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the macerias of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 are scattered.
Nugroho stated that the victims and the damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralysed, with no information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area," said the Red Cross, adding that his staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
"This and already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities had said that the waves had arrived at the time when the alarm had been launched.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you feel a man on a top floor of a building screaming excitedly to warn people of the tsunami coming on the road below.
A few minutes after a water wall fell on the beach, breaking through buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an enormous blackout that interrupted the communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate relief interventions.
According to the authorities, the army has begun to send air cargo with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the fugitives still need food and other items of first need.
The airport of the city has been reopened only for the rescue and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The budget for tsunami victims in Indonesia is over 800.
It's terrible.
Although the World Vision staff of Dongala has managed to reach the city of Palu, where the employees have fled under the shelters of a closed roof in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they have encountered scenes of destruction, Dosebah said.
"They told me they've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even while the relief groups began the difficult start-up operations of the aid tools, there were some complaints about the fact that foreign aid operators with extensive knowledge were prevented from travelling to Palu.
The Indonesian legislation states that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And this hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined."
The second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the scattered still kept the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a child was pulled out by a leak.
Sunday, the escorts released a woman who had been trapped under the massacres for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the preparation of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the paraglided paragliding pilots.
Other people involved in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As veterans in the paragliding sector, I am carrying my emotional load," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the broadcast of the news about the Roa Roa Hotel croll within the parish community, he had been desperate to send messages via WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, stopped at a single mark of grey cut instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a refurbishment of ATM at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying a ATM at Newport on the Levee, standing at a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was cleaning a ATM in the entertainment center and was preparing to deliver another money, researcher Dennis McCarthy said in the communication.
While he was busy, another man "was stabbed to the back of Brink's employee" and stole a purse with the money for delivery.
Some witnesses have identified various suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, standing in the window, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the crime.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the offenders is invited to contact the Newport police number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes its name in Ye
The Kanye West rapper is changing its name in Ye.
When announcing Saturday the change of name on Twitter, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change occurred before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotive reasons", said the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West stated in advance that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'" said West at the beginning of the year, talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We have been passed by Kanye, which means the only one, simply Ye - the reflection of our goodness, of our captivity, of our confusion, of all.
The album is more than the reflection of who we are."
It's just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has also changed the name with or without strokes and letters.
The elected president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore not to use the army against the civilian population
The Mexican elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the civilian population, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody kidnapping against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
The soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when the left student movements were taking foot throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by extending monthly subsidies to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding for the IA
While China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the funds devoted to research in this field, says the investor and operator of IA Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of various groups of the U.S. government regarding the IA, although in the U.S. there is generally no formal IA strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its programme last year: it aims to be the country No. 1 in the innovation IA by 2030.
"To double the budget in IA research would be a good start considering that all other countries are much more behind the United States and we need a new revolution in IA," Lee said.
The duplication of funding could double the chances that the next major success in the IA sector will be achieved in the USA, Lee told the CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the editor's house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the main companies of IA in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an IA system that beat Otello's American player with the highest score and was later head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google section.
Lee remembered the previous U.S. government technological contests as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one will be available to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain funds from the government, Lee said.
"It is not China that is leading the leaders in the academic field, they are the multinationals," Lee said.
Over the last few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have taken light from universities to work on IA projects.
Lee said that the changes to immigration policy could help the US to boost its efforts in the area of IA.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in IA," he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to that of the National Foundation for Science and Other Government Organizations distributing funds to U.S. researchers, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has set up a Joint Centre for artificial intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities, and the White House has announced the formation of a special Commission for artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research into the IA.
In the meantime, the U.S. order to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not registered activities for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change in the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change in the name of the country in "the Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve the dispute over decades with Greece that blocked its demands for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, argues that its neighbours' name is a claim on its territory and has put the veto at Macedonia's entry to NATO and the EU.
The two governments have narrowed a June agreement based on the new name proposed, but national opponents believe that the change would damage the ethnic identity of the Macedonian people of the Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote for the referendum and the boycotting campaign raised doubts about the possibility that the flu would reach the minimum 50% required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum table is as follows: "It is in agreement with NATO and the EU and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say this is the price to be paid so that Macedonia can be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have stated that they will respect the outcome of the vote to finalize it.
The change in the name would require a majority of two thirds of the money.
The State Electoral Committee has stated that there were no reports of irregularities until 13:00.
However, the fluency was only 16% compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters expressed their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, a elector of the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that would open the door to NATO and to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parment in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small stage and setting up the seats in front of the tents of those who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter high-end, not for the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can address others like China or Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that accession to NATO will bring the necessary investments in Macedonia, which will account for a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the level required.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV from Macedonia indicated that 57% of the interviewees planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said he would vote for yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, affluence must be 50% more than one vote.
A failure of the referendum would represent the first serious impact on the policy of the West-West government since it settled in May last year.
Guard: Sergio Aguero del Manchester City marks a goal avoiding the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of Brighton's defense during the win for 2-0 from Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero has made it extremely easy for his point marked at 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a half-field passage at the beginning of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before he got into the open field.
Aguero has therefore found himself surrounded by four green stomachs.
He humiliated a defender before crossing several others beyond the border of the Brighton area.
So he took a left-hand walk, where he found Sterling.
The English attacker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat the porter of Brighton Mathew Ryan with a right arrow in the network.
"Aguero's having trouble standing" told reporters the City coach Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about making him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to signal at that time."
But it was Sterling who initially took advantage of Sky Blues in the struggle for the Premier League.
The goal has arrived at 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in depth in the Brighton field.
He sent a beautiful filter ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
Sky Blues attacker pulled the ball in the net just before he left the field.
The city will fight against the Hoppenheim in the tournament of the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim in Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But as always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch against the Colorado Rockies on Sundays, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which maintain an advantage of a game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to get their title in the first division.
"Even if we play without a goal, we can at least be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the maximum level this year.
And why should I never want to run?"
Nationals still have to announce a first launcher for Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let Scherzer be launched in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, held a launch session on Thursday and would be the first launcher in his normal rest Sunday.
Washington's launcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout in 220 2/3 inning for this season.
Trump a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of the influence of Republicans in the midterm elections.
"All we've done is in November.
We've been five weeks since one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really giving myself up for that, I fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "We see this horrible group of radical democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power using any necessary means, it is possible to see corruption, mechanity.
They don't care who can hit, who have to wander in order to regain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control, and we won't give it to them."
The democratics, they said, have given themselves the mission of "resistance and obstruction."
"And it has been possible to see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "abstained, bad, mechanized and lying."
He referred to the Senate's Justice Commission with democratic Senator Diane Feinstein on behalf of the people, striking strong figures among the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, um no, I look at one - that was a bad language of the body - the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
He won't tolerate people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it was not a big surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of members of the Labour Parliament to whom it has been reported not to be welcome, and all because they said what they were thinking.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has received a similar treatment because he has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all the subjects similar to those about which Jeremy was in disagreement with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, the meetings of Friday evening were just that.
Today, however, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and polite" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it has ever been remembered.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on the basis that it is acceptable or less for the party leadership.
All of this began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and colleagues with whom I had previously thought to share a similar political vision began to expect a trend investment on my part and that I would take positions that I would never have accepted, whether it was national security or the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - they follow ingenious insults to the social media who ask for my withdrawal, denouncing the policy of the center and telling me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I am sure that I am happier than other colleagues because the comments to me direct tend to be political in nature.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to deal with a torrent of sexist or racist abuses every day but who are not allowed to be intimidated.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this political era is the normalization of the level of insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of challenge or change of selection rules, the party is restricted.
In the last two years, I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my opinions so openly, and everything would "be fine".
But it's not about doing this that I came into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the curiosity of the Government Thatcher who had left my class of secondary school literally to pieces, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it as local or government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be left unconcerned by my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will damage the family cores, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the head of the Labour Party.
But in fact the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my electors, who are members of the Labour Party or less: I am proud to serve you and promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of those who think I am your best interests.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: a father struck the scale of the class
Two late attempts might have somehow distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Air has earned the triumph in this extremely fun game of Tennent's day championship.
I'm now at the top of the class, the only team hit on ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their boldness, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we are still beaten, so I must be happy," the coach said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We should recognize the merit of Ayr, they have made better use of our opportunities."
The goal of Grant Anderson at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought the Air to the advantage, but a yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, swayed by Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot reached an unconverted goal.
Climo has increased the distance of the Ayr with a rigor before, exactly half the time, to signal and therefore to convert a target from only to bring the Ayr to 17-5 at the interval.
But Melrose began well the second time and goal of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
There was therefore a long interruption due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, which was spread, and at the beginning, the Ayr was again scored in favour thanks to a goal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The replacement captain of Air Blair Macpherson therefore received a yellow card and Melrose made the man pay again with an unconverted goal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
But the home team is back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a contrast with Climo without ball, from the touch of the rigor, MacPherson marked a touch down behind the mix in advance of the Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had already done since the start, after Rowe had collected the football from David Armstrong's area and sent the flanger Gregor Henry to look for the fifth goal of the home team.
Star of Still Game looking for a new career in the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel sector after finding out that he was appointed director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56enne actor covers the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which writes and interprets together with the long-term partner Greg Hemhill.
The couple announced that the next nine series will also be the final of the show and it seems that Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
Based on official reports, he is the Director of Agingermorn Limited.
The actor refused to issue statements, although a source of Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "successful trade in the restaurant" of Glasgow."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without a break on the sea hopes that a court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The marines patrol a general marine area covered by saritimes in La Paz.
Public buildings display a blue ocean flag.
The basals from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is our right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia without a break on the sea, the memory of the lost coast and now hand in hand to Chile after a bloody conflict on the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to swallow again the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the salon, a spirit of unity and serenity and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive attitude," explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will ensure the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Aia court welcomes the claim of Bolivia that - after decades of intermittent dialogue - Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia a share on the state's sea of competence.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for the elections next year - is very in the process of dancing with the judgment of Monday.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will find it difficult to decide in favour of Bolivia and that it would not change much if it did.
The United Nations agency in the Netherlands has no power to assign the Chilean territory and has specified that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice arrived just six months after the final proceedings indicates that the case ‘was not complicated’, said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law.
And long to advance the Bolivian cause, the last four years could have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The belligerent rhetoric of Morale has been any good intention of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at a certain point, but it will be very difficult to maintain the discussions as soon as possible.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz, the representative of Bolivia to the Aia, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly marked.
Monday, Bolivia will be able "to enjoy extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual advantage", he explained.
Calzadilla has also denied He Morales - one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - is using the maritime issue as a political escamotage.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea affirms that nuclear disarmament will not happen without confidence in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons if he can't trust Washington before.
He spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to have faith in the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments arrive at the time when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be intended to resume the status diplomatic negotiations after the meeting in Singapore with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
It is a 'illusion' that the continuation of the sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never put North Korea to the fore.
Washington fails to issue the declaration without first taking major disarmament actions.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a widespread skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang is intent on abandoning an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The fashion fairs of Paris present the latest trend in huge decks that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to expand your collection of blankets or completely block the rays of the sun, do not look beyond.
Valentine's and Thom Browne stylists have revealed on the passels a series of oversized crazies for their spring-summer 2019 collection that impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely little practical hats have angered Instagram this summer and these stylists have sent their exciting creations to the passerella.
The main part of Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide edge similar to flowers that has submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversize accessories included unjailed corners, a stork hat and even a pineapple - but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks have cut lips and look more like Hannibal Lecter's representation than high skin.
One creation resembled a complete dive with masks and glasses, while another looked like a loose iced cone.
And if you continue with the enormous declarations of style, you're lucky.
The style observers predict that the huge shrieks could reach you in the streets of high fashion.
The outsize hats arrive on "La Bomba", the straw hat with a large thesis more than a meter that was seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very little practical hat that invaded the social media sent another huge creation in a passageway: a beach bag in large straw almost as much as the model in custom that brings it.
The hot orange strip bag, refined with fries in the strip and with a white leather handle, was the strong piece of the Spring-Summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I provide that these great chapels and beach bags will arrive in luxury shops next summer, because the stylist has got such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for global citizens
The Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this is continued in 2018 with another series of exceptional results to the exams, strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further higher education, to the chosen career and to their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector capable of developing and adopting a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular subject and required within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak it in your mother tongue, the message will come to your heart."
This is a powerful reminder of the fact that we cannot rely only on English if we want to create trust relations with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's examinations, we can observe that the languages are at the top of the graduations, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of students who have studied foreign languages have received maximum votes.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students received the maximum vote with praise in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish received the maximum.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as basic skills for children and young people, which will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages, as a matter of choice, are considered at the same level of STEM materials (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons for the difficulty in covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With ever-increasing opportunities of work requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future with a life-long competence like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to competition.
In a survey of YouGov among over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% was unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to maintain a conversation and the French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
The knowledge of more languages, in particular those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a valid job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Various schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by looking at 2020, such as Chinese Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with the personal teacher specialized in this area.
The Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the necessary skills for success, whatever their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will begin his debut with the Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach, Luke Walton, announced that James will play in the pre-flight Sunday opening match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be set for how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After the week-start training, James was asked what his plans were for the programme of six pre-fiction games of the Lakers.
"At this point in my career, I don't need friendly games to prepare me," he said.
The moment of the meeting is a West Virginia Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump from the beginning at Wheeling, West Virginia, this evening at a meeting.
This is the first meeting of the five planned for Trump next week, including closed in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation suspended for his choice to cover the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump will try to create support for the next midterm elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress to the November elections.
Now what will be Trump's start and how can you follow it online?
The beginning of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow the beginning of Trump in West Virginia online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the allegations this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who have become the thesis on charges of sexual violence with an early confirmation vote of the Senate suspended for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of committees is to help the Republicans who have to face the November elections to get a little push.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that these five meetings during the next week are aimed at "give energy to volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority held in the Senate and in the House of Members," I am in Reuters.
"The control of the Congress is so crucial for its programme that the President will travel in as many States as possible while we enter the most busy season of the campaign," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign in Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Programd for the Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling, the tonight's commission could call for supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the coverage of Pittsburgh's media," said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate to the Republican Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in charge of the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to try to give him a push in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, in Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows the courage to fight to keep the hopes alive until Sunday
After three sessions in a single sense, the quarters of the afternoon might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The engine of the oscillating pendulum is a fully invented sports concept in which players firmly believe and never as in racing as these.
So where would the bike be now?
"They had an advantage of six points and now they're four, so I'd say we're keeping a little bike," Jordan Spieth said while he was away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, in favour of four points ahead with other twelve in play.
Americans feel a little wind in favor, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to hope for, not lastly the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each has three points on four.
Speeth was sprayed from tea to green and is giving the example.
Guttural festive walnuts became stronger as the game continued, sinking a crucial well to match the accounts to the game four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His dick that made them win the game at the 15 hole was welcomed with a similar url, which tells you that he believes the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You really have to worry about your game," Spieth said.
It's all that each of these players can do right now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with multiple points of Speeth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the uncontested version of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe is four or four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to shoot a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth bogey Friday morning.
That path, and how their energy seems to flow from and to the chassy crowd, strengthens their certainty that they are the players to fight on Sunday, and there would not be a more popular player of Fleetwood or Molinari to suggest a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Rather both at the same time on different lips.
However, the speeches of European glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it very soon to reach Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four-ball, when he was married to Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes have stuck Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they have not even been able to laugh long enough.
However, there's no one to help you get out of your mouth on Sunday.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to observe from a distance through the interactions between couples, advice that they don't give and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained an important advantage in the final day, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, which some, in particular Stateside, have questioned.
Europe with an advantage of 10-6 in the final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid advantage in the final day of Ryder Cup after it has completed the fourball and foursome of Saturday games with a 10-6 advantage in the United States.
The inspired couple made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the score to Le Golf National at four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in an attempt to preserve Hazeltine's lost trophy two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning's fourball, winning 3-1.
The U.S. has more resistance to the foursomes, winning two matches, but they have failed to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from the 12 single Sunday games to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European assortment to win four points of row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points from the four opening parties in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they worked wonderfully to beat down a downwoods and American great Bryson Dechambeau with an even more clean 5&4.
Woods, who moved out for two Saturday matches, showed occasional jokes of genius, but lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven rows.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning's fourballs, is back at the partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three of the world's rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the results expected in a pleasant and ventilated day in south-west Paris.
The three great winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas laid the reference for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a grint victory 2&1 on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and then returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes, losing both opening holes.
Only two times in Ryder Cup's history a team has returned from a four-point gap passing to the individual, although as the owner, the Fury team only needs a match to defend the trophy.
After having been the best second for two days, however, a Sunday contract seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea utterly rejects untrustworthy unilateral disarmament
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions was undermining the country's challenge in the United States, that in these circumstances it would be absolutely refused to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho stated on the occasion of the General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea had adopted "significant measures of good will" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the site for nuclear testing and commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any consistent response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US there will be no security in our national security and in these circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm unilaterally for the first time."
Although Ri has re-used the lamentable notes regarding Washington's resistance to "in phase" denuclearization with which North Korea would be awarded on the basis of gradual actions, his statement was important because he has not rejected all unilateral denuclearization as already done by Pyongyang.
It referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a US president in charge and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim was committed to working towards the "declaration of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees to the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up his nuclear weapons first.
Washington also objected to appeals to encourage the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The USA insists on the need to "have denuclearization" and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive way and even opposes the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can put us in the knee is an illusion of those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our challenge."
Ri did not refer to programmes of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader had announced to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
On the other hand, the minister has stressed the three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last 5 months and added: "If the counterpart of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point dead."
But also, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from that of last year's UN General Assembly, when he stated that it was inevitable to target the territory of the United States with the North Korean missiles after "the president of the evil" Trump had called Kim a "missile man" committed to a suicide mission.
Prior to the United Nations Trump, which had threatened to "destruct completely" North Korea last year, he praised Kim for his courage in undertaking the path of disarmament, but declared that it must still be done much and that the sanctions will remain in force until the denuclearization of North Korea.
Wednesday Trump said he did not have a deadline, saying that "if you want two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: "Respect of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with force and without exceptions until complete, final and final denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported the North Korea control sanctions in 2006 in an attempt to stifle the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
It was divided by Pyongyang in July claiming that progress had been made, but a few hours after North Korea accused him of having submitted "claims by gangster."
North Korea was committed during a meeting this month with Moon to demolish a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States had adopted "compliant measures."
He stated that Kim had explained to him that the "conform measures" he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had committed to Singapore and actions towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course on how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has pushed all its students back to sleep more in an attempt to contrast the growing virile culture to study for whole nights fueled by caffeine.
A university student has found that university students number one in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed the course, which he considers to be the first of this kind in the USA.
He had the idea of starting the course after a conference that had given on the impact of the lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end a girl came from me and said, 'Why is this just said to me now, when I'm last year?'
He said that no one had ever told you anything about the importance of sleep, which really surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, for the first time this year, explains to the students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performances, as well as improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffer from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course of one hour provides for a series of interactive activities.
In a section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students can select coffee cups, tents, gymnastic shoes and books to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performances are influenced by the lack of sleep, and the importance of a evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, therefore encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the effects on the health of the choice to smoke cigarettes," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride linked to "night in white to study" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to a lack of sleep to be a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with a good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, pregnancy, anxiety, and even use it to avoid getting fat, as the lack of sleep brings the brain into a state of inedia, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student enrolled in the Faculty of Chemical and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course, after following one of his lessons last year in Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, hopefully, will be to ask all graduates to follow a similar study programme before joining this competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler advised students to set up a wake for when to go to bed, as well as for when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" issued by electronic screens and LED lights, which can send in tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to beat Gerrard's men
The Rangers have suffered another attack of depression from outside the house with the goal of Dolly Menga that relegated Steven Gerrard's disarray team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
Ibrox's team was looking for the first victory outside the house from the 4-1th February triumph in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team hit Gerrard's second defeat in 18 coach games leaving his team at eight points from the leaders running the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts.
Menga has signaled seven minutes before the interval and a short-inspired range training is never seem able to pair.
While the Ranger now goes down to the sixth place, the Livingston goes out to the third, and only after the Hibernian for a difference of goals.
And there might be further problems coming up for the Rangers after the Calum Spence lookout was cured for a head injury due to an object apparently launched by the outside of the house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly exceeded Air in the semifinals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual training that broke a point at Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team suffocated its opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated by ball possession, but Livingstone has made better use of the balls at its disposal.
They could have signaled just after two minutes when Menga's filter passage in the first time sent Scott Pittman to the door of Allan McGregor, but the central camper lost the opportunity.
A fine in depth of Keaghan Jacobs has therefore found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense companion Alan Lithgow could only pull his side on the second floor.
Rangers took control but seemed to be more hopeful than convinced in their game in the area of rigor.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he had to see a hard time coming down from the 15th following a fight with Steven Lawless, but Albert Steven Thomson ignored Colombian's demands.
The Rangers managed to pull only twice in the first time, but the former porter of the Ibrox Liam Kelly did not let himself worry about the head impact of Lassana Coulibally and a soft shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the opening goal of Livingstone at the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he has earned it only for his commitment.
Again the Rangers failed to manage a football located in the depth of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibally with Ryan Kent and the change had a almost immediate impact because the wing had infiltrated a ball in Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw herself from the door line to block it.
But Livingstone continued to drag visitors exactly in the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett who picked up one long ball after the other.
Holt's team might have increased the distance in the final stages, but McGregor objected to stop Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton presented a last request of rigour after a cross with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our breakfast "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and the CONTEGGIO continues... the day when the future physical Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as Geiger counter.
A solid point of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado," interpreted by those untrustworthy cowboy Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to identify radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earpieces you can really feel the effects of the atoms released from radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "He's a little broken right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that carries his name continues to live on.

They can "see" a common protein with many types of tumors and are then re-animated
An experimental test of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their laboratory change so that they can "see" a common protein of many types of cancer, called HER2, and therefore these cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
The protein HER2 "promots the growth of various types of tumors", including breast, ovaries, lungs and right-hand colon, has explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar procedure to extract immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to beat tumor cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West launches itself in a pro-Trump diatrabe wearing a bright MAGA (Make America Great Again) after its appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was found in the studio during a Saturday Night Live score after a disillusioned performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would be candidate in 2020.
After playing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore an MAGA locker, started a blast against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk so many times to white people and they say to me, "How you like Trump, he's a racist!"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have gone from America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL started the show with a scene whose protagonist was Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star surrounded Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Justice Commission against the charges of sexual violence presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been transmitted, the registration of the West Filipca has been charged on social media by the comical Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock himself is trying to get around West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the public about having spent a bad time in the backstage because of its cover.
"They bullied me in the backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with that bloke together."
I've been bullied!
And so they told me I'm a marginalist," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the basement?" and said "I'd wear Superman's coat because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments have generated records at least twice from the public, and the members of the SNL cast seem to be embarrased, said Variety, with a person who told the magazine: "On this study a mortal silence has been silenced."
West was invited as a substitute for the last minute of the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West unconcerned many with a performance of the song I Love it, covered by Perrier bottle.
West received the support from the head of the TPUSA Conservatives group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: Thank you for taking the test to MASSA."
But show director Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "what it is and this is just wonderful."
"But I have chosen NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") who I think is wearing a poisonous ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
And so we are," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
It's not about the first artist to change his name and he's following Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The friend rapper, Snoop Dogg made himself known as Snoop Lion and, of course, the musical legend of the missing Prince, who had changed his name into a symbol and thus in the artist previously known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder for reception in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was admitted to a Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The defendant will have to appear at Belfast's detention Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Service Office.
The Spade Kit Harington Throne Star attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Trono di Spade.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of male hero, asserting that such on-screen soils often make the boys believe that they have to be hard to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that "something has gone wrong" and reflected on how to manage the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old Trono di Spade co-star, admitted to worrying a lot about this problem.
'I am personally concerned, very at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we now observe?'
Kit believes that television could partly be responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to its extremely male characters.
He went on, 'What's innate and what's taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, which makes the boys think they have to be in this particular way of being human?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for young people.'
In the course of the interview, he also admitted that he would not interpret any prequel or sequel of Trono di Spade once the series ended next summer, saying "have ended with battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will play the main role in the Revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a cinematographic producer and his brother, who is a rapist.
The actor has recently revealed that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best thing happened with the Spade Throne.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me in this sense my future family, and my life from now on," she explained.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, the character of Kit, in Emmy's fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the holding of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to sources of health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported already in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change in the past.
In some regions of China, HIV spread in the past as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, according to the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 units.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, some studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protection during sexual relations within these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to the management of the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that a member of the staff had caught up with the data from the GOP senators, and spoke of "dangerous bugs" and "cospiration theory".
On Saturday, the U.S. MP denounced the accusations made by a member of his staff regarding the publication of personal information by three US senators in the Wikipedia of the legislators.
The Democratic Member of Los Angeles has said that the statements were promoted by opinionists and websites of the "super-right wing".
"Bugies, buggies and still explosive buggies" said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information published would include home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday, issued by an anonymous of the Campidoglio during a hearing of a committee of experts on sexual violence charges against the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The news escape took place after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address identifying the post source has been associated with the Waters office and have released information about a member of the Waters staff.
"This indicted charge is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal and security information have been repeated as a result of these false and trendy accusations, has not been in any way responsible for the escape of such information.
This indicted charge is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticisms from the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Flescher.
"This lie is angry," Flescher wrote.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
It must not be provocative.
He must not question the accused's reasons.
It must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of acting too angry during the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Exorme if confirmed," he tweeted.
In his statement, the Waters stated that his office had alarmed "the competent authorities and the forces of the order of these trendy statements.
"Let us do so that those responsible are slaughtered," he continued, "and that they must respond to all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny English's review still hits - the spy parody with a down-sized Rowan Atkinson
It became customary now to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems applicable to this revival of Johnny English's comedy action, which started in 2003 and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The Renaissance.
Will the veiled autonomy on how many ships we make be the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English from the rubber face and the eyes out of the orbits got his license to cash things out for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that is a comical creation developed for non-anglophone film-bearers countries.
Obviously it is the shocking secret agent that despite his strange claims of glamorous has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pizza of that kind that has contributed with a single note to the theme of Gloria's opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
This is a character based initially on the mysterious international traveler and man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard television ads, leaving the chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this last release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English who approached the helicopter by wearing a medieval armor and the elevators splattered briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems quite subdimensional and strangely superfluous, especially now that film brands "series" such as 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comecy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed towards children rather than adults and for me the crazy disadvantages of Johnny English are not as original and as the gags of Atkinson's mute films when he plays Mr Bean.
The pressing of immutable news now is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker infiltrated the British spy supersecret web network, revealing the identity of all British agents in the field, with the agent in charge, a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vessel stumble for a alleged and tortured prime minister, who is already suffering a wave of political impobility: Emma Thompson is doing his best with this character like Teresa May but there is not much to work on in the copy.
Its intelligence consultants inform you that each individual active spy has been compromised and that it will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this means that the illustrative Johnny English, who now works as a school leader in a chic establishment, but who also teaches in an official way about how to be a undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gag, when English offers a school of Rock spying course.
English is rebuffed in Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with his former sufferer Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a girl's role in the high society in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of the disasters for the secret services of His Majesty are again in action, to meet the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling into the network of the charismatic billionaire of technology that claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the late Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their hate of riticole adventures: transformed from chamberries, lighted in a French restaurant; cast out the hell by secretly entering on the luxury yacht of Volta and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a mask of virtual reality to take away the dissatisfaction with the inside of Volta's house.
All the scenes are certainly ideal for the last sequence, but because of the glaring and exuberant, there is a lot of TV for children throughout history.
Everything is quite modest.
And how did it happen with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't do less than think: the British cinematographic industry couldn't assign Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to be drawing up a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical programme that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, although paid for five.
The party would like the main companies to transfer the savings obtained by the artificial intelligence (IA) revolution to the workers by offering them an extra rest day.
In this way, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, keeping the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and with plans to attract the country to the benefit of workers.
The transition to a day of four days was reduced by the union congress as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party stated to The Sunday Times: "A review of the political line is expected by the end of the year."
"There will not be a day to day, but a four-day working week is an in-line aspiration with the party's approach to the economic rebalancing for workers, as well as with its industrial strategy as a whole."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
In any case, this aspirations do not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's political line and is currently not the subject of discussion."
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of the Labour Conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "no-faced conductors" and "speculators" in public services companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also imply that the current shareholders of the water distribution companies could not recover their entire shareholding package, since the Labour Government could implement the "deductions" on the basis of the conduct considered illegal.
It also confirmed the plans to include employees in the corporate management councils and to create inclusive participation funds, so as to transfer 10 per cent of the net ownership of private sector enterprises to employees, which end up in the annual dividend tax of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" if the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation in the context of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh referred the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court at least one week, and raised doubts as to whether the findings of the government agency could influence or not any of the senators who were Republican in providing their support.
In an interview that will take place on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it is possible that the FBI will bring something to light to them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said it while I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, which had come out of that charge, and I said, 'Have you done it?'
It has been resolved, determined, unmistakable."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be carved into the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and could resist a bomb-proof charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever you named couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything in change again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that sees the exhibition of a remarkable chariot of stars and has a equally predictable mission: to end poverty in the world.
At the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people turning around on the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy performance such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also a awareness of the real purpose of the event, the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public of the concert had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way that would help raise awareness about their purpose of eliminating poverty.
But, precisely, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival now that they are 12 years old to achieve the intended purpose?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is really a genuine way to persuade people to demand an appeal for action, or is it just another example of the so-called "clickivism"- people who feel they really make the difference simply by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reportedly recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, operated for a multitude of different purposes.
It states that these actions have contributed to encouraging world leaders to announce commitments and policies of more than $37 billion to influence the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
In the first years of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and advertisements out of their shares, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or used as funds.
The group estimates that so far the capital funds have had a direct impact on some 649 million people in the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives based in the United Kingdom, committed to "helping children to grow as much as their potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and the Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions have been implemented calling on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced the expansion of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on their website, who asked: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard path - sometimes we fail and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of those who will take part in this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement "a block" and prevent Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington may, "if necessary", use its Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, has revealed the Secretary of the Interior of the United States of America Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East lies in the fact that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southernmost of Europe," he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to confront you.
"The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, to implement a ship block, so that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the agreed events hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that self-defines the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same thing.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to make a financial contribution and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "a little versatile", with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas in Europe, and to replace Russia, an option that for European consumers is absolutely the most economical.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including the same President of the United States Donald Trump, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2, a project of "inproportional" gas pipeline that, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that Nord Stream 2, spent 11 billion dollars, designed to double the capacity of the existing one up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Cremlin objected that Washington's fierce opposition to the project was simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting held in Moscow in September with Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy of the United States.
The position of the United States has sparked the negative reaction of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), asked the United States to stay out of the European Union's energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see as a big problem the fact that a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take "serious consideration" to run for the Presidency in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he will take "serious consideration" of his candidacy following the mid-term elections.
During a city assembly in Holyoke, in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he could see the possibility of running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and put in place our poor government, and that means having a woman to the vertices," The Hill says.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously my candidacy".
During the city assembly, Warren said his address on President Donald Trump, saying he was "caring this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, by whom he was appointed to the Supreme Court.
On Friday Warren wrote in a tweet: "It's natural that we need an FBI survey before the vote."
A survey published on Thursday, however, has shown that the majority of Warren's own electors do not believe that it should run in 2020.
58% of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not compete, according to the survey of the Suffolk Political University Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported such an application.
The survey has gained greater support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent in support of a potential candidacy and 48 per cent in contrast.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in terms of potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after being rolled up in September
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night.
"What's happening to my son, what's happening after he's back, I can relate it to other families that are experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress and some of the injuries that our soldiers return with," said the public at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they return a little different, tired, wondering if there is that respect for which their soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have dedicated themselves to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship for domestic violence and possession of firearms under narcotics, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Colombia support the challenge for new asylum policies
Eleven States and the District of Columbia support a legal battle against a new United States policy that denies asylum for fugitives from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and the District of Columbia presented a friendly, curious memory in Washington on Friday to support an asylum-seeker contestant, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the candidate in the appeal Grace v. Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He stated that his partner "and his violent gang members" abused her, but the US officials rejected his request for asylum on 20 July.
She was put in a standstill in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States, such as nations that face challenging problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new United States asylum policy came to a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals, which enabled them to submit a request for asylum to immigrants who are not refugees from domestic violence.
On Friday, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, stated that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law imposes that all asylum applications are judged on the basis of differences and particular circumstances of the request, and a similar prohibition violates that principle," states friendus curiae.
In the memory, the prosecutors also objected that the policy banning the entry of immigrants is damaging the economy of the United States, affirming the clear probability that these become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges not to guarantee asylum for victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
"The asylum is accessible to those who leave the country of origin because of persecutions or fears due to race, religion, nationality, belonging to certain social groups or for political opinion," Sessions said on June 11, as part of the policy line announcement.
Asylum has never been designed to mitigate every problem -- at least all the serious problems -- which people have to face every day throughout the world.
Experienced attempts to recover to Palu while the death budget doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly desperate.
"There's a lot of tension," said the mother 35enne Risa Kusuma, while comforting her little feverish child in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"At every moment there's an ambulance that brings bodies.
The clean water drains."
The residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, reversing among their fragile personal effects, trying to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people and hospitals were injured, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were unusual.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, victim of a shoulder and back fracture, stayed outside the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outside due to the constant strong shocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he told the feeling of the violent earthquake that shook the room that shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
"I've been shocked among the maceries of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a marriage.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silent.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "making prepotentials" with "advertising advertising"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement on a U.S. daily, publishing the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to advertise.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the announcement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the newspaper with the highest sales in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congress elections on 6 November, a charge that China rejects.
The trump charge, regarding the fact that Beijing was trying to get involved in the U.S. elections, noted what US officials have referred to Reuters as a new phase of a Washington labor escalation campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a escalating trade war that aimed at adapting their duties to their respective imports.
The Chinese takeover duties at the beginning of the trade war were intended to hit exporters in States such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and US experts have said.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and previously long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now increases those prepotentials by publishing advertising on our free newspapers."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing a pay advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Viceversa, in the corner of the road here in Beijing, you will find few dissident voices and you will not see any real reflection of the missing opinions that the Chinese people might have on China's troubled economic path, as the media are under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important journals has made the offer to publish" his article, although he has not stated what the newspaper is about.
The Republicans are alienating the female electorate before the half-electorate with the Kavanaugh case, the analysts warn
Since many high-level republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court and are on its side in dealing with various charges for sexual harassment, analysts have indicated that a negative reaction will be seen, especially by women, during the future half-term elections.
The agitation in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially demonstrated their willingness to continue with a vote.
"These things cannot be withdrawn," The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill Grant Reeher for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last minute for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to place angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said on Friday, according to the newspaper Washington, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesperson of the Progressive Group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, the protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate Hall, when the Republicans controlling the Judicial Commission chose to continue with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats are going to the stars," said the news site Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they were already tall; it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among the indecisive electricians of the peripherals and young electors, between 18 and 29 years old, who often do not vote despite not thanking the president."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which provided details of his charges of sexual harassment against the candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts had assumed that a negative reaction could have occurred if the Republicans had continued with the confirmation.
"For the GOP it has become a confused set," declared at the beginning of last week Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee, according to NBC News.
"Not only is this the vote for the committee, the final one, or if Kavanaugh is to be put in a panic, it is also the way in which the Republicans managed the situation and the way in which they dealt with it," noted Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect the Democrats.
In any case, Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to whom to believe following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a lower percentage in favour of this latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the interviewees were sure or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claimed to have certainly believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent claimed to believe that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one of the other defendants, Deborah Ramirez, as reported The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath, before the Senate Judicial Committee, that Kavanaugh assaulted him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez maintains that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposes his genitals during a festival during the studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that tries to rejuvenate with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that brings its origins from the open source Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people may have access to and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee argued that the intent behind Inrupt was "to dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data storage" or a POD.
It can include lists of contacts, things to do, calendars, musical libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data storage is that it is completely at the user's disposal that can have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal power through the data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff involved to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology programmers around the world will be able to give life to their decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not tell "Facebook and Google if you enter or not a complete change where their business models are completely removed from one day to the other.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to seek commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential speaker in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
After the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Head of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the ecclesiastical of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only ecclesiastical of the Church of England to be awarded a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was commemorated in its hometown after 100 years.
The Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, received recognition on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglie and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a check and never knew that he had achieved the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren opened a memorial trail.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone would have been opened exactly 100 years from his grandmother's award.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battle beyond the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a great fog, under the heavy fire of the camp and war machines".
Then he rushed towards the line of fire and with the "largest galanterie" made the line move before he had run with a single cannon and landed three of the distance.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German checkman on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandmother's actions were "something I know I can never be at the height and something that makes him more humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he was truly honored to play a role in the parade" and added "the value of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given to him by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and on the contrary they beat Peppa Pig
Imagine, you've been awake all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 only to see the vision of the main event.
The program by San Jose included 13 matches, including six on the main card, and was to be transmitted to the United Kingdom during the night, live on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mouusasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom were shocked when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some are based after being awake until the first hour of the morning specifically for fighting.
On Twitter a fan described the transition to cartoon animated for children as "a kind of bad taste joke".
"The government's regulation provides that at six in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so it was necessary to switch to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of the Bellator for marketing and communication, when he was asked for the transmission.
"Pep the pig," "yes."
"The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they will work on programming to include telesspectors from the UK in the future.
"I think that when I think about the play, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But there are six in the morning of Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for them.
But we're working.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of messages came and nobody was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you, next time it won't happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we do normally - and we have tried to get so much for the fans, and we have just discussed it.
It's a terrible situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
The Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his own sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he had not noticed, until he came to high school, that "not all are like me."
Speaking at the first point of Desert Island Radio 4 Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice hear about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that being a parent made him less important to win the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the old-day program, Kirsty Young, took a series of months free of disease.
Presenting himself as a marginalist in the first Laverne program, Daley said that he felt "less than" anyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable that he liked both the boys and the girls".
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, was the things that really gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to try to be "something," he said, so that no one would be disappointed if they had discovered their sexuality.
The two times bronze medal at the Olympics has become a high profile LGBT activist and has used his own face in the Australian Commonwealth Games this year to appeal to more countries to discriminate against homosexuality.
He said he had made his voice feel because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three times world champion said that the fact of being in love with a man - the US director Dustin Lance Black, who knew in 2013- "was a surprise to me".
Daley married Oscar's winner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When she was so young," he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar high and low.
Both became parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "full perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about the fact that "I had to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked was if he had already had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't be from these parties to be in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I had not yet realized that it was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley raced in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze.
"I only knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a house audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had a special meaning for him in the preparation for the Olympics and still makes him the leather of the eye.
Desert Island Disks is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The outside Mickelson shape put in pankin in Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will sign a Sunday record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an unhappy rock billionaire.
Mikkelson, playing in the biennial event for a 12th time record, was staged by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and the foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as was often for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day working as a cheerleader and working on his own game in the range in the hope of correcting what torments him.
Having never been the strongest driver even at the edge of his career, the 48th year is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the unconnected path regularly punishes the wrong hits.
And if the path itself wasn't quite discouraging, Mikkelson, in the ninth Sunday match, faced the exact British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who collaborated with the novel Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If Americans, four points below the start of their 12 single matches, start with a balling start, Mikkelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.
Fury expressed confidence in his man, not what he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a package on my shoulder, put a arm around me and said he'll be ready for tomorrow," Fury told me.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a Hall of Famer and it's added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine playing two games.
I had imagined more, but that's the way she went and that's the way we thought she should go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else."
Mikkelson Sunday will exceed Nick Faldo's record for most games played in Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of a career in Ryder Cup that has never even long reflected the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 defeats and seven pairs, even though Furyt said his presence has brought intangible goods to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, argument, he likes to play people, and he's a great boy to have in the meeting room," she explained.
"I also believe that the younger players were fun to sit against him this week, something that was fun to watch.
He's done a lot more than playing"
The Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can soon fade
Thomas Bjorn, the Captain of Europe, knows by experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a backdrop.
The Danish debuted at the 1997 meeting in Valderrama, where the team, captain of Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point distance from the Americans, arrived at the track line with a minimum advantage, winning 141 1⁄2-131⁄2.
"I continue to repeat that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but little," said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday for 5-3 and yesterday for 10-6, at Le Golf National.
"That's why it's gonna be the story to prove to me and to my team that's not finished.
You have to give the maximum tomorrow.
You have to go out there and do everything in the right way.
It's not over until the points are marked in the sink.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that's what we have to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players of my team, but I know well who is on the other side: the best golfers in the world."
Luckily the way his men raced in that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have gotten over it.
That tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performance, which is another thing.
It's nice to meet you there with a teammate when things go well, but when you're just your golfer's abilities are tested hard.
This is the message you need to convey to players: tomorrow, you need to get the best out of yourself.
Then you forget about your partner because he has to go there too and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will seek in his players the best individual performance than team, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who have collected three points on four.
The same Furyk was found by both parties in those great meetings of the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing against the European "Miracolo di Medina".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players in the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to go straight to the right foot as we did in Brookline and Medina.
When the game starts to take a certain fold, pressure increases in the middle games.
That is why we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys in the way we think is appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the contestant and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said about his selection for individual meetings.
The new German military ship has been re-posted
According to local media, the last cargo of the German Navy would have to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the Cold War times, but there will not be at least until next year due to defective systems and an increase in costs.
The Rhineland-Pfalz commission, the ship admiral of the new shipments of the Baden-Württemberg class, was posted until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the military Navy in 2014, but worrying questions after delivery have tormented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the military Navy in 2007 will replace the old ships of the Bremen class.
They will have a powerful cannon, a range of aircraft and aircraft missiles as well as some hidden technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use new rails up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continuing delay implies that the innovative warships, which say they will allow Germany to project their own superior power, will already become obsolete when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate Type F-125 reported last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
There has been little knowledge about the reasons for the return, but the German media have noted a number of critical "bad software and hardware" that have made the ship useless when used in a combat mission.
The deficiencies in the software were particularly important as the vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half the staff of the oldest ships of the Bremen class.
In addition, it has been shown that the ship weighs too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the possibility of the military Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the Rhineland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tons, is twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
Apart from the defective hardware, even the cost of the entire project (including equipment training) is becoming an important issue.
It seems that it has reached EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems involved in the new freight became of particular importance in the light of recent alarms concerning the reduction of German ship power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the military Navy has actually "a shortage of ships capable of being used".
The official stated that the issue had deteriorated considerably over time, since the old unarmed ships had not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the Baden-Württemberg crew members could join the Navy.
The National Trust spys on the secret life of the bats
New research carried out in a holding of the Scottish Highlands is aimed at revealing how pipelines use the view to search for food.
It is hoped that the findings can shed light on the behaviour of the only existing flying mammals and guide future protection activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and suprano pipelines, as well as brown ears and Daubenton pipelines at the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special registrants will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of the pipelines during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
The analysis of the sounds recorded by an expert will determine the frequency and manner in which each species behaves.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be produced to create a detailed picture on the scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for the protection of nature for NTS, hopes that the results can reveal what habitat areas are most important for the pipelines and how these are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the creation of plates, and how to best maintain forests for pipes and other related species.
The population of pipelines in Scotland and the United Kingdom fell significantly in the last century.
The pipelines are at risk because of the construction and development works that are interested in tricycles and ruin the habitat.
The wind turbines and lighting can also constitute a threat, as can the mossic paper and some chemical treatments of the building materials, as well as the attacks of domestic cats.
The pipes aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to detect insects and obstacles on their path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the pipelines very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the traps and sometimes perform rescues.
The organisation has even set up the first reserve of Scotland to be used exclusively for pipelines in the Hareve area, in the Dumfries and Galloway region, which hosts eight of the ten pipelines in Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal territory.
"That in Treve we have a vast area for the pipelines," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.
But there's a lot on the pipes we don't know yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about their need for growth."
It underlines the importance of controlling the pipelines before driving the maintenance within the property as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single mother’s womb can kill up to 400 females and small ones, perhaps by breaking through a whole local population.
The pipes are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to trouble them, to disturb them or to destroy their traps.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish minister for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn on our pipes and for many of our species we don't know how to pass it on to their populations."
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of rape while the lawyers cause the German weekly
Christian Ronaldo labeled the accusations of violence against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to advertise" with his name.
His lawyers are preparing to cause the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the charges.
The Portuguese attack by Juventus was accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also noted on Friday the charge of $375.000 to keep silence on the occasion.
In a video on Instagram, directed to its 142 million followers, in the hours following the charges, Ronaldo, 33 years old, broke the statements as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five-time Golden Balloon directed towards the video camera.
"They want to be advertised through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for making my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything's fine," the dancer added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to bring charges to Der Spiegel, defined as "an unacceptable reporting of suspicions on the private sphere".
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damage to the extent corresponding to the severity of the breach of privacy, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights in recent years".
The fact would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga would be back in the football room, where he was subjected to anal violence, as reported in the statements filed at the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga argues that Ronaldo would have fallen in knees after the accident, saying that he was for "99 percent" a "good boy" disappointed by "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that both had a sexual relationship, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also stated that she had been sent to the police and to hospitals, where her injuries had been photographed, but that she had subsequently agreed to a conciliation agreement as she felt "terrorized by the returnees" and worried about the prospect of "coming humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old is now trying to overcome the agreement, claiming to be still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the arrival, and this summer he will join the Italian Youth with a contract of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom will permanently replace the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "needs to compensate for the loss of its world leader's status in the construction of cars after Brexit, said the Minister of Industry Greg Clark.
He also added to his concern for the statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC regarding the possible withdrawal of Britain from the EU without an agreement and the resulting temporary block of production in the factory of Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese automotive house maintains that delays at the borders, in the case of a Brexit without agreement, could affect jobs.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis factory, in which the Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
It raises concerns about other English automotive manufacturers for leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, maintains that after Brexit will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern is the risks in the supply chain identified by the manufacturers in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The production line of Toyota is managed on the basis of the concept "just in time", with parties arriving every 37 minutes from English and European suppliers for cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be dissipation at the borders that would cause delays and lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than one day of inventory value in its establishment of Derbyshire, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark maintains that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "thinking precisely to avoid these barriers at the borders".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but to take this opportunity," said the BBC Radio Today programme 4.
"The test, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a chain of great success."
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production could stop, but in the long term it is cautioned that additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of plants and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsovallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the union delegates of the facility, says that the workers are deeply concerned: "On the basis of my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are no longer reintegrated."
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be sent back, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "reputed for a week", while continuing the debate on Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, which focuses on the Russian interference with the elections, the links between the Councillors of Trump and Russia, and the possible obstacle to justice by the President.
The possibility that Trump could fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thus endangering Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
During the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a shirt to record the talks with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and shouted that he would quit.
On the contrary, it was announced on Wednesday a meeting with Trump, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that "they would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was recommended to avoid a overlap with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of inquiry of the FBI's questions against Kavanaugh, further reversing the final vote of the Senate.
On Sunday, Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "It has not been set a date, it could be this week, I imagine it will be another week considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press."
Some journalists might contest this statement: Sanders has no briefing with the press at the White House since 10 September.
Driver Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefing is not due to an advert for television journalists "who put themselves in a show", although he said, "I don't relax with the fact that they put themselves in a show".
So he made me think the direct contact between Trump and the press could be more frequent.
"The president has more questions and answers than any president before him," he said, adding without quoting the evidence: "We have checked the figures."
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We try to do this, as in the last few weeks, and this will replace briefings with the press and you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
The press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown the reason, making a free-wheel talk, and at the same time beautifying, in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to the Scottish workers of the Scottish NHS to express his concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working at the Scotland NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
The Scottish Parliament Member Jeane Freeman sent a letter with less than six months in advance of the UK's entry into the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to meeting the costs of established status requests (state of a stable resident) for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "All summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit have continued, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British Government has also prepared itself in the possibility of a scenario without agreement.
I know this is a period of great concern for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleges from all over the EU, and not just themselves, provide valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and communities to which we offer a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was operated urgently following a head wound
The Tennessee State Tigers defender, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after having reported a head injury in the Saturday match against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost for 31-27, as reported by Mike Organ of the daily The Tennesseean.
Technical Manager Rod Reed told reporters that the accident that caused the wound occurred shortly before the interval.
"He's getting close to the boat camp and he's gone," Reed said.
The first-aid workers and the medical staff have given Abercrombie the oxygen on board, before putting it in a barrel and taking it away for further tests.
A Tennessee State leader referred to Chris Harris of the Nashville WSMV, Tennessee, who Abercrombie underwent surgery at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no news about the type and entity of the damage" and that the Tennessee States are trying to understand when it was hurt.
Abercrombie, a second year student, is at his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He had made a total of five posters before leaving the game, which brought his total season to 18 posters.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher ball taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher ball taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to the new workers' plans
The manoeuvre will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in ball tax will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury Ministry plans to collect up to 120 million sterlings a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher ball taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, today will announce Theresa May.
The maneuver will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's initiative's success to attract young voters with the promise to provide more affordable accommodation and higher income.
The increase in ball tax will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional resources will be supported by the Government's initiative to combat the phenomenon of homeless people.
The surplus, which is added to the current ball tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on the second houses and on the properties buy to lets (purchase to be rented), could be more than 3%.
The Treasury Ministry provides that the manoeuvre can collect up to 120 million sterlings a year.
An estimated 13% of the new constructions in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, increasing prices and making it difficult for buyers to enter a first house in the real estate market.
Many of the country's richest areas, especially in the capital, have become "phantom cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of the time away from the state.
The new policy arrived a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a cut on the ball tax to help the younger people with the purchase of the first house.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking over land without using them and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up the shares on affordable accommodation in order to arrange for British real estate.
Mr Corbyn announced a comprehensive series of proposals for the reform of the housing market, including rental controls and the elimination of undeclared losses.
He also wants to give the council more power to build new properties.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said that I would be committed to restoring the British dream, which is that life should be better for the new generations.
This means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right if the purchase of a house was equally easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, as it is for British workers.
For many people the dream of owning a house has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My greatest wish is to drive Scotland"
The technical director of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "great ambition" is that of becoming Scotland's manager before or after.
The Scottish, 42 years old, is attracted by the challenge of re-launching the North-East team, which is currently in the third place in the League One, at three points from the summit.
This summer, after being guided by St. Mirren during the Scottish Premiership of the last season, has been brought to the stadium of Light.
"I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I was in series B and that's all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound program.
I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager."
The predecessors of Ross at the direction of Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former technician of Alloa Athletic maintains that he does not feel any anxiety in following such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"The success for me at the moment is measured with the ability to bring the team back to the Premier League."
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I can get the team together."
The start of Ross's career as a manager dates back to three years, after a period as a coach in Dumbarton and 15 months as a replacement coach of the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to escape from the retreat to the third level and brought St. Mirren from the corner of the retreat to the champion title of the Championship, the next season.
Ross maintains that he feels much more comfortable now than during his career as a footballer in the teams Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls about the direction of Alloa.
"I really thought that the role of manager was made up for me, more than the role of player.
It seems strange because I worked well, I earned to live and I had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with weekly.
I still face them in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management seems good.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it, I feel much calmer than I've ever been in my life."

The summer heat wave has led to increased incomes for the English public in difficulty and increased concern for the restaurant services.
The data show that pub and bar have seen an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant revenues are lost of 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's commercial consulting company, added the data and commented: "The persistence of the sun and the long stay of England to the worlds made it possible that the month of July followed a path similar to that of June, when the pubs were over 2.8 percent, while the restaurants were hit more hard.
The 1.8 percent stake in the restaurant in June is worse in July.
The pubs and bars in which you drink have been the strongest, with a homogeneous increase above the drop of restaurants.
Even the pubs in which you eat have suffered the heat, although not too much like restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars managed the sales of drinks are 6.6 per cent per month, while consumption of food is three per cent."
Paul Newman, an analyst in the RSM recreational and reception sector, said: "These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sports events remain the main factor when it comes to retailing.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent per annum will be particularly serious in addition to the continued cost pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come in a worse period for the restaurants and only time can tell if the most moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary shock."
The overall growth of sales between pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was from 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in brand roll-outs.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitoring company for pubs, bars and British restaurants brings together and analyzes performance data through 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion sterlings, and is the industry reference company.
A child on five has a secret social network account that hides to parents
A survey reveals that a child in five, some only 11 years old, has secret social network accounts that hide to parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the "fake on Instagram" pages
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content has been put into the background
20 percent of students have claimed to have a "principal" account to show their parents
A child in five, some of only 11 years old, creates a social network account that keeps adults hidden.
A survey of 20,000 students from higher secondary schools revealed a rapid increase in the "fake on Instagram" account, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual backgrounds are being placed.
Twenty percent of students have said to manage a "principal" account that they refuse to show their parents, while maintaining a private account.
A mother who accidentally discovered the secret site of the 13th-century daughter, found a teenager who urged others to "beautiful me."
Research, the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of Private Schools, has shown that 40 percent of girls between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them have allowed to hold private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many adolescents are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Elid Doyle was elected non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council during the National General Assembly of the administrative body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete of light athletics and President Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for those who manage sports to benefit from his wide international experience in the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys a deep respect for the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that in Scotland the athletic could bring an enormous advantage to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I don't see the time to act as a voice of athletes and hope to be able to contribute and help guide sport in Scotland".
The American, winner of 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medaglie, as well as the BBC opinionist, found himself unable to walk following a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time could have told me if I was taken back and to what extent.
It has been an exciting job, but I have been completely regained, he has learned to walk again, and today I am moving with agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!".
The advertising of a turtle compares mothers and pigs and divides the online opinion
A producer company of a turtle has divided the opinion into a network with an advertising that compares to the mothers who chew and the cows who grow up.
To mark the launch of what is defined as the "first silent and unbearable shootout of the world", the consumer technology company Elvie has launched an advertising in the form of funny musical videos to show the freedom to express itself as mothers given by the new shootout.
Four real mothers dance in a bunch of pigs on a track that includes songs like: "Yes, I throw my milk but I don't have one thing" and "If I hadn't noticed it, these are not moms but my tits."
The choir continues: "Take it out, take it out, feed the children, take it out, take it out, throw the milk to my lord."
However, advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy in the network.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated different reactions among viewers, many of whom have argued that it would highlight the "growths" of the dairy-house industry.
"An unfortunate decision to use the flies to advertise the product.
Like us, they must also stay pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their little ones are stolen to them a few days from birth," someone wrote.
The arrow Elvie wears discreetly under a mother’s belt
Someone else commented: "I understandably traumatic both for the mother and for the little one.
But yeah, why don't you use them to publish a mother shootout that'll keep holding their kids?"
Someone else added, "It's really a pointless advertising."
Others have defended him and a woman has even admitted to finding the "funishing" song.
"I think it's a great idea.
If you're still bleeding, I'd like one.
When I used the gunshot, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a bit insurmountable, but it doesn't get far from reality.
This is a great product," someone wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a fun advertisement dedicated to mothers who use the turtle (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like "bitches."
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the household industry."
At the end of the video, the protagonists show that they danced with the discreet shot in the regissen.
The concept that the campaign inspires is based on the idea that many women who use the turtle feel like flies.
However, the Elvie turtle is completely silent, has no wires or pipes and can be infiltrated in a breast-feeding regimen, giving women the freedom to move, holding the children in their arms and even getting out while they take the milk.
Ana Balarin, mother's partner and ECD commented: "The Elvie turtle is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing the women who use the turtle to the pigs, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by showing in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new turtle is able to ensure."
This is not the first time the Elvie shooter has heard.
During the week of London's fashion, the mother of two children presented herself on the chair of the stylist Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved into a tentopolis at the borders of Texas
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially even though the monthly crossings of the borders have remained relatively varied, in part because the rhetorical toughness and political line of the Trump administration have made it more difficult to trust these children.
Most of those who took refuge in them were mostly clandestine immigrants who are now afraid to repeat the possibility of staying in the country offering to perform such a gesture.
The risk was increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the digital prints would be taken and that the data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities to the potential trustees and other adult members of their families.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer at Immigration and Customs Strengthening, said in front of Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had offered to take care of children alone.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no prior penalties.
"Some 80% of the people who offer to take children in trust or belong to the families of these people are illegal in the country and most of them are criminals.
We are therefore continuing to hunt these people," Albenz said.
To try to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules so some of them will have to appear in judgment within a month from the stand, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, as stated by those who work at the reception points.
Many will appear in videoconference rather than in person, to perpetuate their case of legal status at a immigration court.
Those who will be considered unfit to receive help will be quickly expelled.
The longer the children remain in trust, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or attempts to flee, as they say who works at reception points and the relationships that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position claim that the probability that this happens is even higher in a large structure such as that of Tornillo in which, due to its size, it is easier than the signs of children's discomfort are ignored.
They add that moving children to tents without giving them the time to prepare emotionally or to greet friends could exacerbate the trauma many are already facing.
Syria urges the U.S., French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In his address to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even if the war had now reached the eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces occupy the Syrian territory illegally with the claim to combat terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without any condition," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011, more than 360,000 people and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and support the Kurdish and Syrian forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the field in this country destroyed by the war.
On the problem of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions are favourable to their return and accused "some Western countries" of "incite intruded fears" that push refugees away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he reiterated.
"That should be just a humanitarian problem is being politicized."
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be granted in Syria until a political agreement can be reached between Assad and the opposition.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a coastal zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created the opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented an extensive attack by the Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the agreement had "precise deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target the jihadists, including the Al-Nusra Front fighters linked to Al-Qaeda, who would be "distributed".
The United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon a new committee of government and opposition members to extend a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, stating that the work of the group should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump will be awarded the second term
On the basis of this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators may hope, its presidency should not conclude in advance because of an impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the end of the most dramatic presidency of all!"
At the moment, there are no signs of the spectators' fluctuation.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first night are more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has on average 2.4 million viewers in the first night, definitely increasing compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" programme has exceeded the percentages of the network reaching 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with the most important news.
"It's a fire to which people are attracted because it's not something to explain," says Neal Baer, a television showrunner of ABC "Designed Survivor" who tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Campidoglio.
In Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
She asked him for a reason.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh."
So chaos is a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the plot of Washington's rivals can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade judgment, whether immigrant families can meet or not and the state of health of the global economy.
Stop following the news, however, is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes well beyond the duty of informed citizens to follow for the sixth time consecutive a group of experts discussing Bob Woodward's in-depth research for his book "Pura", of the $15,000-dollar strawberry jacket by Paul Manafort ("a full-blown dress" commented The Washington Post) and the implications of the unpleasant descriptions that Stormy Daniels makes of Trump's anatomical parts.
I, for example, won't be able to look at Super Mario without thinking.
"Part of why what makes a reality show is that every night there are novelties," says Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", regarding the awareness of the actors and daily developments of Trump's show plot (in contrast with N.F.L., who praised Kim Jong-un).
You can't lose an episode, otherwise you stay back.
This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and although it was a day of sun with almost 30 degrees, he was closed at home looking at the MSNBC and then recording the CNN.
He failed to get out of the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate's judicial committee and before the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when we once did all those absurd programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization".
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Cash flow in the race for half-sented closed elections
It is not a surprise that in the 17th district there is a cash flow due to the reorganisation of a congressional district that has made two members in charge now running for the same place.
The recent redefinition of Pittsburgh's suburban district leads to the stage of the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his place in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another member in charge, the Republican Keith Rothfus, which currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that in the old districts the electoral colleges were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The 17th district race triggered a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a measure victory in the March special elections for the 18th Congressal District of Pennsylvania.
That place was occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump was awarded the district for 20 points.
Politicians have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. thought of penalising El Salvador because it supports China, then changed the idea
Diplomatics have observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017 a rather friendly meeting took place between the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the leader group of the Trump Organization to leave.
Officials of the State Department have decided to bring the heads of US diplomatic missions back to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following "the recent decision not to recognise Taiwan anymore", said the spokesman of the Department Heather Nauert in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the decision to apply sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million from Americans for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on the granting of visas, would be of concern to the country of Central America with a high percentage of unemployed and murderers.
After a series of internal meetings, North American and Central American officials referred to a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, high-level officials made it clear that they were going to continue with the conference, thus definitively rejecting any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been commissioned to preside over the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to this meeting, the diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving any further notices or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman from Bolton to the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak anonymously of internal decisions.
What they told was confirmed by an external analyst near the administration who nevertheless wanted to keep the anonymity.
Study history
In the report he will publish, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction to justice, which seems to be sufficient evidence now.
According to what is said, Mueller's investigation aims to shed light on the possible collapse of Trump with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If the Congress passed on to the Democrats, Trump should respond to these accusations in front of the voters and perhaps to a jury of its own as it prepares for a new candidacy.
The unknown are many and I do not intend to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as is not the case with his counterparts in Europe.
In both sides of the Atlantic we have to make choices that will determine how long the fight could take.
In 1938, German officials were ready to organize a coup against Hitler if the Western powers had stopped him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Monaco.
On that occasion we failed to escape the opportunity to avoid the years of carcinogens that followed them.
The course of history revolves around these points of development where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans have to deal with them at the moment.
What would happen if Trump decided to license Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein's position has been complicated since this newspaper reported that last year he secretly suggested submitting Trump to interceptions, questioning his ability to fill the role of president.
Rosenstein maintains that the news published on The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the FBI's new investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the pending charges of attempted fraud and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in favour of a Congress asking Trump to respond to his actions?
If we do not overcome these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we'll do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to light the candles of Sabath with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorrans dei Rangers is optimistic about meeting with the Rapid Vienna
On Thursday the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing match against the Villarreal in Spain, would give them an excellent opportunity to qualify for the Group G of Europe League.
Even though due to an accident at the knee, the central champion Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season just on the occasion of the 2-2 match with the Villareal, he believes that this result can allow Rangers to do great things.
"It was a positive result for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 30-year-old player.
"We faced the game convinced of doing good and brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extresis, but, all of a sudden, the match is a good result.
They were better in the first time, while in the second we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points, but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not be able to fail.
Last year it was certainly difficult because of my bad luck and changes at the club itself, but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys have fun and the preparation is going well.
We can therefore forget the problems of the last season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the long-term costs of assistance
Although those who have participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have addressed the issue in the family.
About half of the nationwide interviewers said they had talked to their spouse about the long-term cost of assistance.
Only 10% claims to have spoken to their children.
According to Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Insurance Sector on the life of Nationwide, "people want him to be a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't face this conversation."
That's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to assist you if you do not communicate for a while what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be decisive for the costs.
Involve a financial consultant: you may be advised how to pay the costs you will have to deal with.
The choice of long-term assistance funding may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life policy with a saving value to cover these costs or continue to pay for insurance until you can do so.
Prepare all necessary documents to avoid legal battles at your death.
You appoint a health care officer so that a person you trust can monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes in the event that you were unable to communicate.
Also evaluate the possibility of a search for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions in your place and make sure that your accounts are paid in case you were unable to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is being taken by emergency to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so you can always be ready.
"It's not just a financial issue, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare for any event."
A man hit several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was hit several times with a compressed air rifle while running on his feet after spending the night out.
The victim, a quarantine, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, in Devon, when it was hit by the chest, the abdomen and a hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST, as "accidental action".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
He's not in danger of life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died following a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The victim's budget is intended to go out.
The communications are interrupted and the aid managers have failed to have any information from the Donggala region, a north area of Palu, which is near the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake 7.5.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data about Palu and Dongala in the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Centrale, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongalla is a settlement extending over 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The estate, an administrative region dependent on a province, had approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the province of Sulawesi Centrale and, above all, the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowoli, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Another tsunami struck the Western Dongala area in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Sismic zone called the Pacific fire belt and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh to the north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries killing, along the coast of the Indian Ocean, 226,000 people, including half of Aceh.
2005: a series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: an earthquake of 6.8 hit the southern zone of Java, the most popular island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that broke down against the southern coast killing almost 700 people.
2009: a magnitude earthquake 7.6 fell near the city of Padang, capital of the province of Sumatra West.
The victims were more than 1,100.
2010: a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of Mentawai islands, along Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake struck Pidi Jaya in Aceh causing destruction and panic in the people who remembered the destruction of the earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There were no tsunamis in this case, but more than 100 people died under the massacres.
2018: a strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of whom in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested with the charge of aggression.
On the basis of a statement issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29 years old, by Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he broke their phone.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretral Facility center and its security was set at $500, based on what KTUU reported.
According to the television network, it appeared on Saturday's judgment and it was declared "innocently innocent".
Palin is at risk of being charged with three first-degree crimes, namely detention up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also assigned a second-degree crime punishable with a day of detention and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin is accused of criminal acts.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to signal the alleged aggression.
The case is currently under consideration by the court of Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, of obstructing the report of the crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her with a fist on her face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by groups of veterans in 2016 for having linked the child’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of the period in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude earthquake 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity network and communications network do not work, and the victim's budget is intended to go out in the next few days.
The earthquake struck far away from Sulawesi Centrale, located in the north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, videos show the moment of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people were gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand extraordinary capital punishment for suspected terrorist attacks in NYC
The federal prosecutors in New York ask for the capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the author of the terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people: a rare punishment that has never been committed for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a rental truck from Home Depot to float on a cyclable track along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
On the basis of the conditions for the demand for capital punishment in the southern district of New York, in order to justify the sentence of death, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and also "intendedly" affected serious bodily injuries.
According to the court's document, both of these charges can lead to a death sentence.
Seven weeks after the attack, a large federal jury issued charges against Saipov 22 chief of impeachment, including eight counts of murder with criminal association, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack called for "a real planning and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov brought it to an end as "atrocious, cruel and oppressive".
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov has caused damage, offenses and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since the South District of New York persecuted the last case of capital punishment.
The man quoted in the judgment, Khalid Barnes, was accused of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to eergastol in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy by spying and incriminating for having passed information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg's wives both died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
On the basis of the court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no sign of punishment in the days and months following the attack.
The police say that in front of the investigators, he said he was proud of what he did.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he had decided to bring the attack to an end after watching a video of the ISIS on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As far as the 22 heads of taxation are concerned, it has been declared innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, has been called "evidently disappointed" by the accused's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than accept a confession of guilt and the condemnation of ergastol without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's group of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament Tory claims that NIGEL FARAGE must conduct the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today swore to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of the members of Parliament of Theresa May's party suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians must " feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out of Europe" if Farage was the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges that May must face in trying to reconcile the positions of its deeply divided party have been underlined by the Torys favoring the existence of a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to implement the Chequers Plan between the attacks of the Brexit supporters, of those who want to remain in Europe and the European Union.
The Allies insist on continuing their attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing Eurosceptic and Labourers to choose between what May proposes and the "caos".
At the beginning of the Leave Means Leave organization held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"We'll be out of Europe by now," he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan".
Explaining the reasons for its opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be helpful.
We want to be able to apply our laws in our country."
Bone rejected the opinions that the public opinion would have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed the idea and want to stay in Europe is completely false."
Parliamentarian Tory Andrea Jenkyns, Brexit's supporter, also participated in the court and said to journalists: "I simply tell the prime minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the public in general, the opposition will not vote on it and does not enjoy the favor of our party and our activists who turn on the trails of votes to allow us to be elected.
Let's lose the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In an incisive message for May, he added: "The prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises."
At the beginning, Farage said that politicians should be able to " feel pressure" if they intended to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't allow it."
In a message for the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make us feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the popular army of this country that has voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, those in favour of living in Europe have marched along the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour commission in the city centre.
An executive number of activists pushed Tory against Brexit's flags after the group was formed this weekend.
The Labour Party deposed the Conservatives for security problems they had with an app from the party at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can install IT systems and all the technology for the Canada agreement plus, for wireless borders and for trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's all a farce.
A good Brexit does not exist," he concluded.
Warren is seriously thinking about running for the presidency.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said that after the November elections, he would seriously think that he would run for the presidency.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic Senator of the Massachusetts Saturday spoke of his future during a city assembly in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, often criticizing President Donald Trump, is a candidate for the November elections against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that could challenge Trump in 2020 was already in the air.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump settled in.
One participant asked if he was going to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is now that "women go to Washington to set up the government, and this implies that a woman takes over the highest charge".
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge's police in Louisiana informed on Saturday that he had arrested a suspect for the murder of the LSU's Wayne Sims basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11:00 on ETNews.
On Friday he broadcasted a video of the murder asking for help to identify a man visible in the sequences.
Yes, 20 years old, he was hit and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims reported a gunshot wound to the head that killed him," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on 247Sports.
Wayde intervened to defend a friend and was struck by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene of the crime in possession of a weapon and that he had hit Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and held in a standstill at the Parish Police Department of East Baton Rouge.

Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the victory on Sebastian Vettel thanks to the team's orders
When on Saturday Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of his friend Lewis Hamilton, it was immediately evident that the orders of the Mercedes team would have made the competition heavy.
From the pole, Bottas goes well leaving Hamilton to defend himself from the attacks of Vettel in the first two rounds.
Vettel stops first to the boxes leaving Hamilton in the traffic of the group's tail, moving that might be decisive.
The Mercedes stops the next tour by entering the track behind Vettel. However, Hamilton overcomes it after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari pilot tries to prevent it from going inside by risking ending after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen is part of the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
So drive the race for most of the race without stopping at the rubber exchange boxes and try to finish quickly to overcome Kimi Raikkonen by winning the fourth place.
At the end, however, you have to stop the pit stop at the 44th round and in the remaining 8 rounds it is not able to increase the step and overcome Raikkonen, which reaches quarter.
"It's a difficult day because Valteri worked very well all weekend and was really nice to have me spend.
The team has done an exceptional job to win the first and second positions," Hamilton said.
A bad example of body language
On a Saturday afternoon commission, President Donald Trump surrounded Senator Diane Feinstein for his insistence on not revealing the contents of Christine Blasey Ford's letter that he was trying to rape the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
During a commission in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the testimony made by Ford in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "mechanical, bad and false".
"What can happen and what is happening in the last days in the Senate where people are angry, angry, evil, and lying" he said.
"When there are clear signs that the news is being disclosed and those responsible say, "Oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember your answer... have you revealed the contents of the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it... No, we didn't do it" he added by imitating the senator.
The letter in which the Ford accused Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was released at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the indiscretion was withdrawn from his office.
"I didn't hide the accusations of Professor Ford, but I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the confidential information and I did it."
But his lie is not credible for the president, who at the beginning of Saturday night commented: "I say this, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen."
By continuing to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, who was accused of attempted sexual offence by three women, the president suggested that the democrats are using these accusations for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the messyness, the captivity. They are not interested in those who harm, who must pass over to regain power and control," the president said, as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer has signed two goals for Giants versus Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after the defeat of Friday in the Elite League match against the Belfast Giants winning the return race for 5-3 Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants immediately took advantage of two goals on Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team to the parley before Dwyer brought the Giants to the advantage.
Francois Bouchard marked the match for the Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for the men of Adam Keefe who had come back to Belfast on Friday night and won the match with the Dundee for 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times in this season and the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 on Kendall McFaul's assistant, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assistant.
In what was a rather animated first time, Sullivan reported the home team starting at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Marquardt provided the caretaker of the match at Cownie at 15:16 p.m.
Dwyer decreed the advantage for the Giants, marking the second goal of the evening at the end of the first time.
The home team recompiled and Bouchard re-evaluated the match after a strategic manoeuvre at 2:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have contributed to Nielsen's action that has benefited the Dundee for the first time in the meeting at the end of the second time and decreed the victory of his team, marking the fifth goal in the middle of the last time.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five meetings at this point, will play the next home game in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia a flight controller will be called as a hero after being killed to allow an aircraft carrying hundreds of people to take them safely.
More than 800 people are dead and many are scattered because of a strong earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Strong siege shots continue to be of interest to the area and many are interpolated among the maceries in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues were fled to save their lives, the twenty-first Antonious Gunavan Agung remained in his place in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which was fearfully oscillating.
He wanted to make sure the Batik Air 6321 flight, which was on the track, was able to land safely.
So he threw himself out of the control tower when he thought he was going to hang himself.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australian issuer ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It's really sad news for us," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of victims can reach thousands and the national disaster countermeasures agency shows that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The task of the dead is intended to increase because many bodies are still under the masks and it has been impossible to reach many others," explains the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Where high to 6 meters have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be carried out on Sunday.
Military and commercial vehicles are transporting aid and livelihoods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water leaks.
The mini-arquets are packed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told the CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the men of the country's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation activities.
Are you ready?", as reported by CNN.
During the year Indonesia was already hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people were killed.
Aerial Disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a dispersion after the incident of the lagoon
The airline of the plane that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after saying that all 47 people aboard between passengers and crew members were able to save themselves, now it maintains that there is a dispersion.
According to Air Niugini's news, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing on the phone.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details about the passenger, such as the age or nationality.
Local vessels have allowed the other passengers and crew to escape after the incident while the aircraft was trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
According to official sources, on Friday, seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline claims that six passengers were returned to the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable conditions.
What caused the incident and the exact sequence of events are not yet clear.
The United States airline and the United States Navy maintain that the aircraft is rushed into the lagoon because it did not reach the track.
Some witnesses argue that the plane has crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived at a very low rate.
"Ed was really a fortune," said Jaynes.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, were able to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He added that the flight attendants were made to panic and gloat and that he was slightly hit on the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some marines who were working nearby to set up a bridge have provided support using a rubber to transport people on the shore before the aircraft was sinking in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that in the last two decades 111 people have died in incidents of aircraft of the lines registered with PNG but none of these have involved Air Niugini.
The analyst rebuilds the night of the burned woman alive
On Saturday, the presentation of the evidence of the charge in the new trial against a man accused of burning alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the United States Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the cell phone data to rebuild the movements of the defendant Quinton Tellis and the victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to the report by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett stated that he had recovered the location data from several cells that showed that, contrary to what he said, Tellis was with the Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with the Chambers during the period he claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke with Sanford.
Sanford presented himself in court on Saturday and testified that that day was not in town.
When the public ministry asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by claiming that that night was in Sanford's truck, the latter confirmed that he was "falsely because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said to know the Chambers for two weeks when she died.
On the other hand, cell data indicate that they only met for a week.
Rowlett explained that after the death of the Chambers, Tellis removed from his phone the messages, calls and contact information from the Chambers.
"He canceled it from his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final argument on Sunday.
The judge shall provide that the judgment shall be passed to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is hip-hop aware of?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the kind by inserting positive messages in their own right.
The High Breed Group of Bristol maintains that the hip-hop was removed from its origins when it broadcast political messages and reported social problems.
Instead, they want to return to the origins and make a sort of hip-hop conscious again.
Artists such as Fugees and Commons have recently returned to the UK thanks to characters such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
A father of New York cites a couple in judgment to have fired her with a "racist" text.
In New York, a father cited a couple in court for discriminating dismissal after having received a wrong text in which the mother complained that she was "another black".
The couple refuse to be racist by comparing the request to a true "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that her new father, Giselle Maurice, arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO A OTHER NERA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message for her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after being aware of the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "embarked" fired Ms. Maurice saying that she was not happy with their previous father, an African American, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
She paid the day off to Miss Maurice and sent her home with a taxi.
Maurice quoted the couple in judgment and, to be fired, asked for a refund for the beauty of $350 per day for the six full-time work months for which she was initially hired, even without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this," he said to the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple responded to the charge of racism by saying that Maurice's dismissal was the only thing to do because they were afraid they could not trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent you a message in which she said something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," said Joel Plasco's husband at the Post.
"Would you trust your children to a person with whom you were escorted, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a true "extortion", Plasco said that the wife has only been pregnant for two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't deal with a person like this.
It is not very kind behavior," the financial consultant added.
While the legal case is still under way, the public opinion court has immediately denounced the spouses on social media by criticizing them for their behavior and for the logic followed.
A letter reveals that the editor of Paddington was afraid that readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, comments the letter as follows: "It's not easy to put on the board of those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's fun now that we know the great success of Paddington."
By saying that the father, who worked as a cameraman at BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a playmate, would not have responded well to the rejection of his work, adds that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a bit "stricken" after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family" adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was a man quite quiet, not a supposed person," he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved like when you have a son who reaches a goal: you're proud of it even if it's not yours.
I think he interpreted Paddington's success this way.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my daughter who was dying.
At the landing, the daughter was transported by emergency to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"He didn't call me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter wouldn't do it," says Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then he called me to tell me that she would be dead in a few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medications that the doctors had given them to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowing down.
She died a little while ago, and it was over.
I had to sit down and wait knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on to it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, aggravated by the loss of her daughter, went up on board the plane with the other pagan passengers of what was happening to her.
"No one knew," he says.
"For all the time, I've done nothing but cry at the bottom of my head.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I heard an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Two women's painful tickets to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have committed suicide commit themselves to prevent others from doing the same thing.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked a bridge in Wales with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and was killed at 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel like I feel every day," he says.
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, tells us that his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said it was lighting every room he entered."
But before he died, he left the job because depression had brought him "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found him after he had taken his life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid there's a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don't have to isolate themselves, they have to talk."
Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old companion, not long after his mother died.
"You never said you were feeling down or depressed," he says.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
The day of Christmas touched the bottom. When the children opened the presents, he avoided looking them in the eyes."
He says his death was an enormous trauma that they had to develop: "He has paralyzed the family.
He made us pieces.
But we had to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain: the FBI has launched investigations
"I think that if we could do as he asked, with a limited investigation at the time and within, we could reach an agreement," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee itself would "lost calm" because of the blockade of the radical supporters.
Why doesn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to be indicted?
Their resolve is due to the choice of time.
There are only five weeks left for the mid-term elections, November 6th. If the Republicans as planned will get a negative result, they will be severely weakened in their attempt to elect the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators by pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush, and thanks to him, he met Ashley's wife, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has completed its report?
He will vote in the Senate, which is currently made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to break the indugi and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of political refugees in North Korea "diminished" with Kim
A South Korean legislator states that the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un went to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting the data from the South Korean unification ministry, claims that the refugees were 1,127 last year against 2,706 of 2011.
Mr. Park explains that the main reasons are more stringent border control between North Korea and China and the highest rates of demand from those who make these people out illegally.
Pyongyang did not issue public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border from the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) strongly protected between the two Koreans.
China considers them illegal migrants rather than refugees and often returns with force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month, the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to talk about the negotiations on denuclearisation that are in a stable situation.
This after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general to cooperate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized the United States sanctions for the lack of developments since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be certain of our national security, and in these circumstances there is no possibility that we will proceed with unilateral disarmament for the first time," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi defines Brett Kavanaugh as "isteric" and maintains that it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority Nancy Pelosi defines the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as "isteric" and states that it is not particularly suitable to cover this task.
Pelosi expressed this opinion on Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think that if a woman had acted in the same way, she would have defined it as a nun," Pelosi said about the statement made on Thursday by Kavanaugh in front of the Senate's judicial committee.
In a visible way, Kavanaugh denied the charge of having sexually harassed Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in the mood, so much to get almost to the floor and with the throat close to the crying while he was talking about his family and the years at the upper school.
He has also explicitly condemned the committee's democrats who have defined the charges against him as an "unscrupulous and coordinated campaign" organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
The Pelosi believes that the testimony of Kavanaugh proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has proved to be preventative of the democratics.
"I think that he has been self-exclusive with his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when he was asked whether he would try to put Kavanaugh in charge if it was confirmed and if the Democrats had to reach the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I think that if you do not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it is not only appropriate for the Supreme Court, but not even for the court that now presides," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the District Circuit of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a democratic, she is concerned about the potential decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh raised questions about his intentions to circumvent certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
The Pelosi stated that "You cannot send a separatist person to the Supreme Court and claim that this decision is welcomed in a positive manner".
And women have to use it.
It's a right diatrabe, months and years of rage attacks from which it can't get out without crying.
"We cry when we retire," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And he continued, "He really helped me a woman who was in charge somewhere. He told me that she also wept when he was angry, but he developed a technique that when he was angry and started to cry he told the person he was talking to "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so he kept going.
I thought yours was a brilliant idea."
Lacrimation is tolerated as an outbreak of anger in part because they are basically not included.
One of the most frequent memories I have of a previous job in a male-prevalence office is when I once put myself to cry for an access to anger. An older woman, a glacier manager from whom I was always slightly terrified, took me for the hill and dragged me along the stairs.
"Don't ever cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they've got you in their hands."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his race to the presidents.
In 1987, when a boat called Monkey Business was discovered, Hart's extra-young report that you had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not have tried to run for the presidency herself.
"It wasn't really a well-weighted decision," he said to me about 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running and there was certainly no need for another.
Someone called it "Biancanev and the Seven Years."
Since the campaign was already in an advanced phase, the Schroeder was late with the fund-raiser and I swear he wouldn't be a candidate if he hadn't collected $2 million.
It was a lost cause in the beginning.
He found that some of the supporters who had given the candidates $1,000 to her would only have given it 250.
"Do you think I can get a discount?" he asked.
When he spoke to announce that he would not launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude to the people who had supported him, disappointment to the system that made it more difficult to find money and voters who represented and angry for the sexual discrimination he was a victim of), that he committed himself.
"He seemed in a hurry to a nervous crunch," recalled Schroeder thinking about the press's reaction.
"Someone could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my stone.
Maybe "Pianese a lot."
How trade war USA-China could favor Beijing
The opening-up of the trade war between the US and China has been fragile and, while the battle is all but concluded, experts say that a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, has already launched the first warning this year by charging the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new items taxing over $200 billion (175 billion) of value, which means that taxes will be applied to half of the goods of Chinese origin.
Beijing has reacted every time with measures of the same kind, applying recent duties from five to ten per cent of US$60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the US hit on impact and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon march back.
Because Washington resigns, it would be necessary to submit to his demands, but to make public the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the US can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions of an economic collapse in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what has been recognized so far," says Abigail Grace, a researcher who studies Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, supports the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says to be ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country that has been devastated for over seven years of war.
In front of the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation in the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees in the country that had to be left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that had an impact on their daily life and their support.
According to the United Nations estimate, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million still living in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would accept voluntary assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any subordinate aid under conditions or on the part of those countries that supported the insurrection.
Europe wins the victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europe team won the Ryder Cup 2018 beating the US team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has thus lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe conquered the trophies when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they used to beat the United States.
The US champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, launched his tea shot in the water at the sixteenth par 3 opening awarding the victory in Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all its tournaments becoming one of the four players always to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was first disputed in 1979.
The American Jordan Speeth was defeated with a score of 5&4 by the lower Danish player in the Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, set up for 2&1 in English Ian Poulter who might have disputed his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia who argued eight, became the European player who won more in tournament history with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't do less.
It was a difficult year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to have regained the cup.
It is a team victory and I am happy to have made my contribution," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the witness to his countryman John Ram who beat the golf legend USA Tiger Woods with a score of 2&1 on Sundays.
"If I think I've grown up looking at his meetings, I'm really proud to have beaten Tiger Woods," said twenty-three Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now the count of his matches in Ryder Cup is 13 wins, 21 defeats and 3 pairs.
A strange statistics if you think it's one of the biggest players of all time winning 14 of the main titles, according to Jack Nicklus alone.
The US team sought all weekend to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
Captain U.S. Jim Furyk said after a disillusioned performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning, we put pressure on the European team.
We took this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All its 12 players behaved very well.
I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and we'll go ahead.
I'm fond of these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We put it all on.
But they played better than us."
