Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours, to address the peace prize here as the fourth President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northern metropolis and will be busy all the time.
He first visited the Nobel Institute, where he met for the first time with the five committee members who had chosen him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The President-in-Office has then scheduled a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony, at which Obama takes over the prestigious prize.
He receives this as the fourth U.S. President, but only as the third person who directly rejects the price in the office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the war on Afghanistan when the price is taken.
The President does not want to remove this issue because he knows that he is taking over the price as a president who is currently leading a war in two countries.
He has strengthened the war effort some days ago by sending troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to give for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a specific karitative work.
The event programme will then provide a banquet with the President and his wife, with which, apart from the Norwegian King and Queen, the Prime Minister will also be present and another 250 guests charged.
Obama was very slow at the price from the beginning.
For example, he suggested that he felt that he did not deserve the prize.
He also repeated that it is not only for him, but also for all those who strive for the same values.
Immediately after the announcement, he pointed out that this was "an order of action" for him.
Naturalists are accused of repression
The leadership police accused the president of the Association of Citizens of the "Natural Protection Community" of repression.
In several cases, in the last year, he called against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his vocations, he asked the investors for money to benefit from it, said the chief police speaker, Alena Romova.
The President of the Limerick-Natural Protection Community, Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and it's threatening him a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorter mill container in Brünn doesn't smell good
In Prague, people can sort the drinking packages, in the South Sea villages you will find the sortier mill containers on foot and step back.
And in Brünn?
There you had to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate mills.
I don't want to say that the waste separation in Brün would not work at all.
But I would like to know whether the Council has enough to deal with this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is in the waste disposal in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here can always dispose of paper, glass and plastics, but especially through the quantity of dust for such wastes.
Have they ever tried to dispose of PET bottles in a collection basket, for example?
This is just art, above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the seaport against the affected gans.
Mr Onderka will not be angry with his colleagues, but I do not have much to do with this.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is also not a honeycomb in other parts.
A lot of my friends don't like to sort out the waste.
From Faulty.
It is too far for them to reach the tunnels.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself after the celebration to get some glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova road, I did not see any shades of paint.
Luckily, I got to the right place on the road.
But the garbage was almost gone.
But this is still the centre of Brün, where the whole city is represented, right?
However, ecology and any kind of aesthetics are likely to cool the brown socialists.
They prefer to buy the city a ice hockey league that makes us ashamed throughout the Republic, instead of buying a few tons more and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner well.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after having been searching the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the company ECO-KOM, Brün is really in the whole district of the South Sea.
The "paroubek" budget has taken away the money for rent and sickness money
After the left-wing party gave more money to farmers and officials in the government's view, there is no more money in the budget for rent, sickness and construction.
But also not for the state debt or for the international court dispute.
This causes even more problems that will be in the government in the second half of the year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists have spent the price increase for some groups, they expect the government to pay the money in addition to the sensitive expenditures, old-age pensions or the health money. "This is just a rise in the problems in the future, mines," says Janota.
Of the loans, increased interest is almost always paid, and the money has to be refunded sometime.
Too much to choose where to take, the state box is empty.
If social benefits or costs for the public sector are not reduced, the tax shall be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the firefight, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for her children.
For the pensions or the sickness money, which has disappeared from their account 1.8 billion, people need not be afraid to get this money.
But for the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, the state will not only lack 163 billion, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janoto, the debt will increase so quickly and with this also the costs and interest.
The State will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer be sufficient to increase VAT only slightly or to cut the maternity money, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
Because of the monetary imbalance in favour of some electoral groups, the next year also lacks five billion for the expansion of motorways and railways.
It is mainly the sections that have been acquired in competition, which can no longer be redesigned and possibly approved.
At most, it is not free of charge.
This means a delay or setting up of thirty large constructions, which is also a threat to the creation of Europe's money, warns the speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the flow of money in Solomon - it attacks the CEZ share dividends in which the State owns the majority and then spends the money in the transport funds.
The problem is that the level of dividends is never safe and it is not an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion CEZ flowed to the budget.
Every year, the dividends are paid out of environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is filled out, and this money is also used as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the actual budget deficit by 5.7 per cent of GDP according to EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of the revolutions.
Almost three billion fell in the budget for various compensations for the victims of communism and for crimes or for expenses for the court dispute, even for the construction of the building.
If the state is allowed without this money, it is not safe.
It's just a game of luck.
If we lose an international competition, then we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister will then have to save the money for ressorters or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing for the already started two billion-year project "State Box", which is intended to allow for monitoring on-line what individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will manage two operating systems
The Americans count for the future with a phone on which the user can switch a single key between different operating systems by pressing.
The plans presented appear promising.
It's enough to just press one key, and from Windows mobile will be in less seconds in Android exchange.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for the computer.
We allow you to run two user profiles on the phone at the same time.
They can switch between these, they can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti said by VMware during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
The market will come in 2012.
Virtualisation of smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully run the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which simultaneously the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems lived simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full range.
Now VMware works together with European and American operators at the smartphone virtualization and to the customer, the devices will come within 2012.
Snow shortage on the mountains warms the hotel owners
Sneeless pistes provide not only the inhabitants of the Giant Mountains.
The missing snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
This is why you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all wintertimes including Christmas and Silver.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, set prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to order.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether, in our opinion, this year's Christmas party will be on snow or "on matsch", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, introduced.
Those who want to stay in the silver mill exactly according to their ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Anyone who prefers to save and where the quality of the stay comes only in second place, who can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle-Hotel owners currently offer only weekly stays for the silver day.
I think they're going to be trying to sell them for a long time, but then they'll have to post them, and they'll have to go in a little bit.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, estimated Jandura.
Free beds at all winter destinations always offer the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper holiday stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silver Day in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi travel office, but here there are less free places.
Good paragraphs are also found in the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter term is sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also adversely affected by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the weekend in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are cut within a week, the Christmas will also be sold, meaning skiing.
Inverted and something better than last year it is possible to occupy the rooms in Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We're about five percent better than in the previous year.
On the Silver Day and Christmas we only have a few more free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec Hotel, Karel Rada.
The hotel Omnia is located at the central park in Janske Lazne, 80 percent for the silver stay.
On the other hand, half of the beds are still available at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne at Christmas.
We were pleased to be surprised this year of January, for which we are already occupied by about 60 percent.
A bit weaker in February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in the stay in the Giant Mountains is certainly also increasing, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, led.
In the meantime, the giant mountain hotel owners are waiting for a larger snow protection.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it comes to defeat, it should be on the mountains snow.
But then a warming came again, Jiri Jakubsky informed of the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeating is Mother of Cliffness
It is almost comical to what student zeal Barack Obama, the president with his reputation as the expert, repeats his predecessor's strategy in the Afghanistan issue, which he himself considered to be the dummies.
Finally, when he postponed his decades-old Afghanistan doctrine, it was shown that he wrote it over the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq script for three years.
Not only does he use the type of speech "as in Iraq" in the text itself several times, he has even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward Way" without suffocating.
Three years ago, he himself criticised the Bush idea - fresh troop quotas in the Iraq put forward by the civil war - as "unresponsible and a karastrophic decision" in its follow-up.
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy that came out of military recommendations was the only possible and thus very successful one that is no longer spoken in today's news about Iraq.
This did not improve the call Bush, as objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
He was once again asked by the military, especially the commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordinating habits, strongly criticized the stunning shields in the White House.
He asked 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation to improve.
The President hesitated for three months, but he did not come up with a better idea, and thus he had hired the General of the Resistance for 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the commitment for another 5,000, even if he himself originally had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of the whole Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that half-retirement will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the brotherly war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the counterindication - no one can be left behind and no agreements will be kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even though they were formally established, remain only lighthouses, behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interest between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the invisibility of the conditions that still complicate Pakistan's and Iran's influences.
The construction of a "potential state", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama's strategy blocked by its volunteerism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and is now at the edge of the explosion.
It is believed that the small soldiers who have broken into the war cry over the "early home" here create a miracle, can only be a truly romantic soul that can't be impressed by things.
From a political point of view, the date set for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, because the Taliban will take this as the indirect opinion of the US defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fights in Afghanistan is changing.
Europe's politicians can and will not explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in Hindukush-Gebergsvorgs.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, there is a very serious question for the United States whether the problem is not to be solved with troops.
This question has to be answered in the period during which Obama is fleeing from Afghanistan to America for victory.
However, each solution will also mean a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only comforting patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years to the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time for him to take another strategy if it would prove to be a total outcome.
The managers of the Bank Goldman Sachs don't get bonus bonus bonus anymore in bar
The leading leaders of the American Bank Goldman Sachs won't receive any award bonus this year in bar.
This has been announced by the company that has responded to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of money that can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares may be removed from the managers in the event of excessive risk.
Goldman Sachs thus submits to the Reuters Agency at the top of the efforts to connect Wall Street premium bonds with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street is aware of the ongoing direction in which it is to go, the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made himself the target of criticism after placing almost $17 billion in front of the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonds over the course of this year is likely to exceed 20 billion dollars even after the agency Reuters, despite the measure shown today.
At the beginning of the financial crisis, the high bonus in the banking sector has become the hottest political issue in a number of countries.
On Wednesday, Britain reported that it intended to charge the bonds of the bankers, which exceed 25,000 pounds, with a single tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all fields, except in physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf accepted this year's Nobel Prize in the professional and literary categories.
In addition to the four scientists, among them the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with her countryman Jack Szkostak, for research in the chromosoen area.
The price for chemistry was received by Israeli Ada Jonathan along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, to clarify the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize for Economy, which American woman Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao have contributed to research in glass fibers and George Smith along with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomical remote pipes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, Nobel medals and certificates on the acquisition of the money prize.
It is made up of ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several price holders in each category, the price is divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most expected peace prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of his appointment, because he was only at the beginning of his journey, and was also at the top of the country, which led two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations to combat world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considers the retreat. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his stay in the government on Friday, because he does not agree with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Parliamentary Assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the state deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president, Radim Ochtvat, informed about the meeting.
On Monday, Janoto wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, about his further stay in his office.
Under the budget law, which now receives Klaus for the signature, the Czech Republic should deal with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
However, on Wednesday, Parliament agreed on the left-hand side proposals for money laundering and increased the money for public officials, for the maintenance of social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy to cover the budget deficit.
Between the left-wing party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party on the other, there has been a sharp internal political dispute, which is why the sign of the further work of the fishing office, on which the ODS, the CSSD and the Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claimed that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, practically liquidated the package of savings measures implemented by the fishermen's government in the autumn, and that, in their understanding, the State debt should end.
Klaus, who is able to sign the law on the state budget, but does not have to, today in the debate with the entrepreneurs, explained that politicians have for a long time neglected the "resolved problem", which is the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only lead to a strong government which could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is gross, and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS President, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
Primer Fischer referred to words similar to "strong challenges" in the editor.
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the words of the topolanek that the state deficit was grossly that the previous government of topolanek had prepared for this year, and exceeded the 200 billion crowns.
As of Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the following year as a success.
The People's Party was happy too.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeatable" of the world shows much of the country, its struggle and victory despite some criticisms, that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, race relations and about Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life story the American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the nine-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon takes on another important role.
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I'm gonna have to meet you.
The two-and-a-half-year actor who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood Drama from the box "Million Dollar Baby" was already the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which to the conclusion became a slave holder, a fictional U.S. president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but only rarely anyone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was in prison for his active activity at the end of the apartheid in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was set free in 1990, and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unsuccessful", and at the same time is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined his forces with the captain of the South African Rugbyte team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people are still racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can share his people through the sport, so he decides to share the backby players who belong to the outside world.
Finally, the South African team rises to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than to play this role so as to bring it closer to reality as soon as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politicians were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, eat with him at night, and be behind the scenes before his talk.
The most important thing for him was to protect his hand.
I found that when I shook your hand, I took your energy, it was transferred, and I felt that I knew what you felt, he said.
It is important for me to be another person.
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national backup team, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hardback world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pianoar in his house.
I remember when I smiled at the Turklingel that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'In the film I look much bigger'.
Despite the obvious differences in the status of the actors compared to their actual models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeatable" and he also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, wrote his evaluation in the following words: "That was a very good story, a very good film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invicts has received 76 percent positive reviews.
The Russians have tested a rocket
Over Norway a special light effect was to be observed of unknown origin.
Only yesterday, the Russian Ministry of Defence agreed that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
The start, however, was again unsuccessful and the rockets, known as the type "Bulava", which should be the pride of the Russian army, will be slow to the dawn of the Russian generality as well as the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site at the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of the sample flights.
Bulava is usually not started or damaged in the air at all.
In the Russian newspapers it is already written about "Bulava" as "a rocket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This is a 13th attempt, it's a normal one at the beginning.
In turn, technical damage to the rocket occurred only at the end of the flight.
Probably the engine exploded in the third rocket level.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the Dmitrij Donskij nuclear-U-boot, which ran under the water of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the discharge from the U-boat.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over the north roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, since the first moment the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian missile.
This time, the generality has defended itself and claimed that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the third stage was only affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage at the same time.
Even if no test start was made without error, the department's management is only six out of thirteen for failure.
The almost fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism, and it is still claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and even ten hypersonic atom sprinkling heads with a total weight of up to 1,15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow with 51 years old
The legendary rebel Vjaceslav Fetisov presents himself again in a professional ice hockey game with 51 years of age.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup -owner assists his team CSKA Moscow in the need, and is probably already taking part in the KHL Free Trade Fair against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another rebel.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify some other formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club by Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player is only a game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other players, the associate Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back to the iceberg, he will become the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, legendary stormer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford with fifty years and was able to write 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships, and also won in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also collected success in the NHL, where he twice held the Stanley Cup over his head in Detroit Dress.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Icecocky Star Room.
Hyundai gave up the trade unions. All over-hours will be lifted
The management of the Nosovice Automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the trade union to abolish all overtime.
Because of often scheduled overtime, the trade union announced the strike preparation on Monday.
This was confirmed by the speakers of the Hyundai Automobile Factory, Petr Vanek.
The management, however, wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday's story this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19th, voluntary overtime was proposed on the grounds that two stories would be worked out, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to the employees who would work the Saturday story.
The employees will also receive it in the afternoon for the Saturday story of November 28.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay for the overtime allowance or they can take a replacement vacation on December 28th and so extend the Christmas celebration, Vanek started.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday story are paid the fare and lunches.
In view of the fact that the overtime of the most urgent and burning point regarding the demands and complaints of the trade unions that had put up the production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the abolition of all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk started.
The employees of the automotive factory were forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift for another 2 hours until last week.
From the signing of the Agreement, the line preparation by trade unions shall be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions will take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike.
The situation in the automotive factory was challenged last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees were spontane because of overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged scandals.
The management maintained that employees need to make overtime to meet the automotive supply requirements.
The trade union leaders also called for no sanctions to be imposed on employees who had interrupted the production on Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions are calling for a minimum reduction in overtime work.
In addition, this year they are asking to pay the fee of 5000 kroner.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The production of the series was launched in November last year.
Up to this September, about 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, which currently has 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that also works in the ‘counted’ HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new connections to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact goes beyond the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the medicines already in use.
The disease of AIDS cannot be cured yet.
Patients may be able to combine drugs, but they can prolong their life and prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
However, it is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus enlargement also results in the development of resistance to which medicines are no longer effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the CR Academy of Sciences, of the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and of the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as metallic carborene affect the protein responsible for increasing the HIV virus.
The metal carbonnes are compounds of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus enlargement in a way other than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists reach new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the virus protein.
The metal carborene have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-faceted cages consisting of bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Domestic and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, no mature virus particles would occur.
When we turn off the HIV prosthesis, we also turn off the increase of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe all kinds of connections in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
Something weaker, but more reliable
The effects of this series of substances against HIV protease were tested in the reagent glass, including against their persistent (resistant) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metal carboran on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the medicinal product used in clinical trials, but does not lose its effect on the resistant agents, which are often ineffective against the medicinal products used.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical formations, makes metal carbourans interesting links for further research aimed at developing effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fighting for budget. ODS went off to fisher who resists
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, referred to the approved budget for the next year as "graenvoll" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, assume its continued existence.
The words of the ODS referred to the Prime Minister as "strong debate".
There is probably time for the analysis.
The vice-chairman of ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party is obviously no longer working.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to combating the growing deficit or whether it is to him to remain in the office with the help of Parliament's links.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of the public deficit is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, but with link-party amendments of more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy to cover the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to save 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it has complied with the Government's wishes, because the amended budget is also only a minor version of the budget proviso.
Disillusionment and insensitivity
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, spoke of his disappointment and a sense of insensitivity, pointing out that the government still assesses the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janot had seriously threatened the case with his resignation, the amendments would have been accepted, the situation would have been different.
According to the Czech TV, Janota signed up for Monday after the government business at the Premier.
He has indicated that he entrusts his other remains in the office.
The reason for this is his disappointment about the budget.
As far as fishermen are concerned about the further fight against the budget deficit, the nominees of Social Democracy (CSSD) who have made the changes in the budget have not done anything in the government, according to Necas.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will be retreating if Parliament continues to adopt the ever-increasing deficit laws, such as those relating to sickness and pensions or the new service laws.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS did not hesitate
This is the case of the Prime Minister and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS made no mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the United States.
It has been mentioned that in some ministries there are people in representative function who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to refuse to fight the deficit of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in Parliament".
Then it is not possible to count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democracies.
I have not thought about it, and when this is the case, I will be concerned with it, Minister of Defence Martin Bartak, nominated by the citizens' Democrats, told the journalists in Parliament.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer fled to Brussels to meet with the European Council.
The ODS returned to the Prime Minister's request
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in Parliament if the Prime Minister expressly asked the representatives of the citizens' democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear to be children, we are not small children, so he answered the question whether the ODS was not repressed in the political debate on the budget by the absence of the chairman in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice my voice would be missing.
As soon as I refused the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would go particularly to the Bolshevik of Parliament and destroy everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
After the new CD (Czech Railway) road plan, fewer trains will be driven at the same price.
The Czech railway will end or be limited from 13 December to a few less loaded speed and local trains, while other connections will be reinforced.
The total volume of transport is reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new roadmap compared to today.
Most tariffs including basic and customer fares are not changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area receive several connections to the capital, the railway is set up for these tracks of the type Pendolino.
The train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less speed trains are also driven on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, basically the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the Hradec Kralove district (Kingsgraz), a total of eight percent, on an increase, Prague and the surrounding area can be pleased.
Two night trains are also lifted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and on a few days a week the operation of some speed trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
The biggest changes include the introduction of the new direct road from Milovice to Prague, and the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem have to move.
It is the fifteenth road of the pre-shipment system Esko, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The distance to the main city will end at the Prague - main train station.
The CD introduces more lines of connection SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will be driven in a two-hour period.
With the Pendolino, the passengers have been unable to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's account for regional railways: increase by 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, totaling the railway will be paid to offset the so-called liquidity loss in the coming year of four billion crowns, just as this year. The local trains provide the districts, all of which pay eight billion crowns in the coming year, with the state killing three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the speed trains, the railway has re-confirmed a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railway commends the system, which may also have not been used to increase prices for the large majority of the vehicles.
Changes come only with day-to-day CD network licenses and with low-cost eLISKA internet licenses.
For guests without the customer card, the price of CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will then depend on the race, until now he was uniformly costing 160 crowns for the trip between any districts.
The Philippine militias have found more than 50 people who have been released.
Today, Militante kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary schoolchildren and their teachers.
This was indicated by the Agency to the AFP, which initially only reported over 65 exports.
All 17 children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
It was announced in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 billion reportedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
Local negotiators are now working on the issue of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP Agency, the militias are members of the New People's Army (NPA), this is the armament of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence, which called for actions between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the standard law was suspended because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November, who were associated with the election to the government, were 30 journalists.
Due to suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippines province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday, they resumed the peace negotiations with the Philippine government.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes to the American cinema "Invictus: the Unbeatable", which includes part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly chosen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
Matt Damon received the role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar.
With the film’s launch, reactions from critics as well as the public are also heard.
Nelson Mandela
His name is Nelson Roliglaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sachar prize, then in 1993 along with the Klerk the Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Large expectations are set in the film because it comes to the cinemas, where in South Africa, on the one hand, the preparations for the World Championship are culminating, but at the same time, the media are spreading the world's public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the population by the black majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are primarily positive, despite numerous reservations against the deployment of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared well for it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela personally so that, as you say, I could receive his energy, he led the interview after the film premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good to be able to understand Mandela's personality and his message with this film.
This is a story of South Africa, but it concerns every human being, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby National team
The film is based on the book presentation by British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people united, depicts the South African human rights defender within his first presidential period.
Morgan Freeman has been trying to bring together separated groups of populations in the course of the film, two races and for years and days, and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he is also acting in his role in the South African National Backby address on the World Cup field, which was won by South Africa at the time.
For entering the race in the dress, which is considered almost a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela grew up with great ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white audience and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may lead to the reuniting of people to a single people, led by the Rugbyby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves, it will only show itself.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as in recent interviews for LN of the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The Championship begins on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out tomorrow at the transformer of the company Ceps in the shed at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
At the fire, according to the speaker of the district firefight Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units were attacked.
Originally, the firearm wanted to burn the transformers, but later it changed its view and now the fire with a mixture of water - foam and special solvents is removed.
The reason was a technical defect, a transformer internal circuit.
No one was injured, the Haverie was threatened by the employer, Pavla Mandatova, the safety operation of the management system.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will be caused only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one, according to Mandatova.
For more than 10 years, Ceps has not experienced anything like this, errors of this kind are rare, added it.
The electricity supply was not interrupted, according to the spokesperson of CEZ for Nordböhmen, Sona Holingerova, by the fire of the Trafostation, the functionality of households, authorities and companies was not affected.
A.G. Ceps is a single operator of the management system operating in the Czech territory, electricity lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovated and develops 39 switch systems with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred to the distribution system and steering line with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura raises a fine for slander against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises a fine for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of Südmähren, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Thesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute interview in the radio newspaper.
The complaint is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional transport in some areas.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the Rosans, while we only exaggerated the offer, as it had been agreed with them.
They claimed that we were dearer than the Czech Railways, because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways that were completed last week.
There's nothing else left for us to refuse.
Because of this corruption of the company Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he argued that he had evidence from all regions that they had taken their steps in line with European law.
That is why we are making a complaint to the European Commission.
Hasek maintains the collection of the fine for the further continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as a free advertising for his company as well as for his own person.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good names and the good reputation of my district, and I also ask for further leaders.
I take it that this will also make it clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the area of regional traffic and uses false and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura had already reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which would indicate the harmful step of the district.
He told the Radio Journal that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and he wants to continue after New Year.
He pointed out that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign started Jancura after the districts agreed on regional rail transport with the Czech Railway and did not issue tenders for the order at a height of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, according to Jancura, he was threatened by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was that if we did not deny that we could also lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, Jancura told the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcals free of charge and free of charge
Immunization against pneumococcals changes the habit from January.
It should be free and voluntary as the first for the families.
But now there are votes that the mandatory impact would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The medical institution is already setting the maximum prices of vaccines that are required to pay the health insurance.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines for free for August children
From January, children can be immunized free of charge against pneumococcals born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose of vaccine.
Anyone who has started the vaccination already in the last year or before must pay for another reintroduction vaccination himself.
The first vaccination dose must be given between 3 and 5 months of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children improvised against pneumococcals.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
In total, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccine doses spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year.
However, they save for treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all surface vaccines of children.
The mandatory impression was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcals cause moderate inflammation, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections cause us to die in hospitals every year for up to 28 children under 10 years of age.
Outside of the Czech Republic, the mandatory influence of children against pneumococcals was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, they will be paid by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
For example, the head of the National Association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned the need to improve the impact.
Its association is already long-term for the Pneumococcal impression.
The experts at the international conference at which our association was involved were not very pleased that we had a voluntary vaccination.
That's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have managed to do this at least.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this point, we do not consider this at all, his speaker Vlastimil Sesen said.
Voluntary vaccination has its advantages, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the company of practical child doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, adds that a voluntary vaccination has its advantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think of the reduction in the number of relapses "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination has been launched as voluntary," Cabrnochova says.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to impress their infants against pneumococcals from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcals is also essential to ensure that it is paid as the first surface vaccination of the disease insurance and not by the State.
Insurance should spend the money on prevention to save it for further treatment, Kabrnochova cuts.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is linked to the care of the practical child doctors involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original scheme, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance and the doctors will then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
However, some Members feared that insurance could produce "the money from health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for insurance to pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is an important sum.
That won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist's son participates in "museum steel"
The son of the famous American Fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was included when inviting 90 paintings into his vehicle with trailers.
It means that Frank Frazzetta junior and another man would have used a bagger to get into the museum in the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his presentation of shapes such as Conan der Barbar and Tarzan.
As the news agency Associated Press reported, the artist stopped at the time of the event in Florida.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family funeral.
According to a police statement, Frasetta Junior, he was told by his father that he should enter the museum with all means to bring all the paintings into storage.
The Agency informed him that Frank Frazetta Senior was struggling to have any permission.
Labour defends state and tax increases
The Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure stops, as announced in the Prefecture Report, against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling would have had an opportunity to "crush" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by exaggerating the decisions until after the election.
The treasurer also operates under the supervision of workers with low and middle income.
Its main proposals include a 0.5-percent increase in social security and a 1-percent reduction in the public payroll threshold for 2011.
Social security benefits
On the other hand, the trade unions protested that low-gloh receivers were punished for a recession that they did not cause and warned of the upcoming "problems".
The increase in social insurance - to some 3 billion British pounds per year - has upset the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic growth.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will be around 10 million workers.
SHORTWEEKNESS OF THE VORAB ETABER
Increase in social security by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year, economic collapse by more than 4.75 %
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
1 % increase in corporate tax for small enterprises rejected
Tax clauses for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in public interest by 2,5 %
According to estimates of the treasure, a person with an annual income of £3000 per year will be poorer and a person with £40 per year will be £90 per year poorer, while a person with an annual income of £10 per year will be richer.
The ministers said that their target of defiction by 2013 meant "hard decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would be charged to the 5% of the top beneficiaries.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argues that the tax increases and expenditure stops are "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit reduction and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth – which affects the extent of new debt and the speed of the deficit reduction – have been questioned after the treasurer was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - much more than the reduction of 3.5% predicted in April - while the debt would be higher by 3 billion £ than previously proposed.
Missed occasion
The conservatives who want to start a new campaign on Thursday to warn Labour's "debt crisis", said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that the ministers have failed to provide a credible plan as to how they will repay it and press "synically" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"They didn't say anything about what they're going to do," said the shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their chance to do this, and they let them go."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour maintains that schools, hospitals and the police will be kept away from future cuts, other than in the proposals of the conservatives, which see the reduction of deficits faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money that will be earned by the tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover the expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements, like the above inflation adjustment for some disabled people in April, the treasurer would be exposed to the draft vote, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour continues to provide extra aid if people need it most and the situation is re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler State"
Although the Ministers did not disclose any details of the state beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public expenditure will only come in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Investigations said that the numbers of the treasurer would mean strong abstractions in many areas, perhaps in the future also in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It will only leave the pain on later," said his manager Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them," Roger Bootle added, economic advisor to Deloitte's business audit firm.
"This was only the high prefabricated report. The markets recognize it."
FBI investigates "Festings of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported US citizens because of the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandschab province, and the American message was shared in Pakistan by the BBC.
The FBI said it is being investigated whether the same men were reported missing in Virginia last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are to be Pakistani descent, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the prosecutions they are being accused of and under what circumstances they will be held," said Ian Kelly.
The FBI speaker Katherine Schweit said the authorities were informed about the arrests and were in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay, if it is actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani message in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that it refused to comment on the arrests, but she said the United States "should cooperate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people".
At the end of November, the five students were reported missing from their families in North Virginia.
Amnesty condemns "misexercise" in Iran
According to a report by the Human Rights Organization Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report details "misuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report stated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran withdrew its earlier criticism of its human rights balance.
Officials said that such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedshad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the greatest street protests since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
At least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, some of the abuse allegations were acknowledged and the closure of the Kahrizak Strafanstalt arranged.
But since then, there has been no tolerance for criticism from the authorities, our correspondent said.
"False Spirit"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer student Ibrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and of protesting the election results.
"They beat me in the face more often," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and became, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty shared with him.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karrubi said that some demonstrators who were arrested after the election were tortured in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities lied to the allegations of rape, but added that abuses have taken place.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained in a prison in Kahrizak for 75 more than eight weeks.
Amnesty admitted that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the concerns of the government's election and reactions to it, but so Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people were arrested in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to turn a mark in Bristol into a match.
The ski trails of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
At the top of the hangs in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-metre hangs.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a wonderful view from the top of the hangar, but it was also quite scary.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that shine down.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some right talents."
Prices were awarded for the best art pieces or tricks performed on the hang.
After the event on Thursday evening the snow will be left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a ban on mining and the concerns about the alleged Islamization of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-founded and well-founded report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most secularised societies in Europe.
Some readers will read this new book with admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love hats" (Original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and close-minded study of a question that the country has shared and occupied for over half a decade and its effects are still to be seen today.
Above the latest book offers a more comprehensive and cooler spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the area.
He spent months in Moscow, schools and institutions that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic Freedoms".
He's a good listener, he's giving talks between teachers and students about the questions they most worry about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a councilhouse (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about Evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a censored banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These seem to be profanity issues, he claims, which make up the daily life, quite contrary to the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim teacher and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
You don't have all the arguments on your side.
The conservatives are mistrustful of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who questioned the Bowen are mostly inseparable with their Salafi rivals – the perpetrators of the purist Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – today show a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be agreed upon.
But an agreement requires a gift and acceptance on both sides.
He questioned how much French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately watch the separation of the Church and the State) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He points out that Muslims may experience a more severe treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews who had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
Rather, he recognizes a "strengthening of value screws" as a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book you are inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The Untrustworthy View of the World
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice, which marks it, softens with alarming speed and takes life with it, which can survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have taken place in the newly opened water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws a natural history of the icons of the North, the Ice Bear, in the original title.
In the complicated history and politics of the forest, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting on the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an ice bear as a braver 14-year-old Fännrich to the lake, who fought only with the weapon of his Muskete, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mother were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century showed 75 ice bears in a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have a million of the living area of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the ice bear in Singapore was completely green from the algae that grew in the tall hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for survival of the species.
Although it is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the situation in Greenland and Canada continues, where hunters in helicopters and motorcycle-driving inuit use powerful storms to bring their bets to the line.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (Original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a packaged insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can properly explain the speed of the changes.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century allowed for the first time the confusion of the package.
In the Cold War, submarines are able to move the gradients in the underworld.
A useful supplement is satellite measurements and the large-scale expansion of measuring probes to icebergs, but it is still much achieved by fearless people who camp outside the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the unique, tiny world of the influx system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater salts that are compressed when freezing.
But, beginning from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little wonder in the ice, all are at risk when the summer season is over, which is calculated between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... we could be"
Marine infantrymen were among the 6,000 who landed in Arlington Kränze.
The mountain free De'Angelo Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to put a single tap on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other marine infantry who took the trip of Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Freedhof in Arlington to taste the miners, the day was a trip to the men and women in whose steps they had taken.
In a few months, from where we are always brought back, we could be that, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay cranses on the tombs of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Freedhof.
Morril Worcester, owner of the tradesman Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992, when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred miners at the Friedhof in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morril and his wife, Karen, who take this journey every year, stop in different cities along the way to carry out events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also established a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crossings on the miners on the Arlington-Friedhof, in the areas of the Pentagon, the miners of the Fayetteville National Friedhof in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York and the memorial site for the United Airlines-Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation spent for the second time more than 150,000 dollars for the purchase and transport of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she had taken the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Though her husband is not worthy in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back some of the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution to how we can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family funeral.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked across the extended lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older diggers from the 1st and 2nd World War and Vietnam War as a goal, as they are not visited as often as the newer diggers, the organizers say.
The mood was happy, the children played and the couple held on to their hands, while they carried the fresh pine branches to the grey stone.
Each round cross was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is near and where mainly the veterans of the war are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost silent.
The United Service Organizations spent 1,000 kroners to decorate this section, but the dark mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals were crying openly, others were beaten and families and friends were stuck together in the icy air.
Some read, according to the names engraved in stone, while others moved down to small black and white space maps, which were laid out for those in the damp mud whose engravings had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who died before the grave of her son’s bitter tears.
It is 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, traveling to visit the graveyard of Marine Infraternary Officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been there for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractor of the U.S. government of Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has held a contractor of the U.S. government, mobile phones and notebook computers sold in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. with a seat in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers such as USAID, the US for international development and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the US delegation in Havana try to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The special charges have not yet been published, although, according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything, under the charge of "hazard".
All these so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include slight protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Governmently hostile graffiti and statements are considered to be serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tensions between the communist government of the Castro-Brüder in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported on Friday by the New York Times.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will be given a victory when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and wanted products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are used mainly for sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost a day's pay.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government stations, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in Cuba are in prison because of crimes such as drug smuggling behind Gittern, said Gloria Berbena, the press speaker of the U.S. representative in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and prison are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the release of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, which recently issued a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, same Cuba", a reminder of Raul Castro's official establishment as the leader of the country, who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants would be arrested, convicted and arrested very often within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States at the time when the two countries are moving for more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives cover plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered a allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said they hoped that this case could help to detect an excellent network of terrorist applicants who search the Internet for radicalized young men.
The investigators said that they were looking for an impartial rebel, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had invented it, because one of them on the Internet video site had submitted comments on terrorist attacks.
After arriving in Pakistan, Saifullah was the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's Secret Service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Qaida leader that men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to submigrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the unjust mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered to be part of a hidden operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not discouraged and continued to try to receive the right recommendations to gain access to the Al-Qaida warehouses when they were arrested by the Pakistani criminal authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of the applicants in identifying future terrorists and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence service has made it the most urgent thing to put human active posts within Al Kaida.
The prosecutors of the organization act as pörtners who do not allow those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who might be spies.
American power recruits are subject to a special test by A Kaida, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be unrelentingly attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation with headquarters in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more careful in recent years as to whom they have allowed access, as the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to include someone in these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Ten thousand demonstrators are calling for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded from retailers in the Bella Congress Centre of the city's cooler climate protection action.
The demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, but the police estimates went from about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists knocked small explosives near some government buildings in the city.
On a day when the UN-supported climate negotiations rarely occurred, thousands of activists walked through the city, on which "There is no planet B" in English and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars join the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travels to Peru, the country of their mother's birth, make you aware of the heartening problems the country has to deal with because of the already felt effects of climate change.
This is part of the reason why I decided to take part in the great demonstration - in order to continue the word and appeal to the world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from approaching the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying bags.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a viewer who did not want to be mentioned, since he is involved in climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing burned several strands near the Copenhagen main channel, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the building, he said, and added that they started as light-tracks, but then followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the Congress Centre, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wei, China's head climate dealer.
When he was asked whether he thought that the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international discussions, he said in English, "That's something I wasn't even aware of."
He then went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He found that it depended on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the broad public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show a hardy race climate
Last week, the witness to mathematics was welcome good news for public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the schools of the country, the evidence shows that in the past two years, the four and eight-year-olds have made more rapid progress than the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the hard work gap between African and white students, both at local and national level.
In the last two years, the average number of white fourth-graders from Washington D. C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but only about three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American eighth graders remained essentially the same, with a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white students was not included in the test data, as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The race, which separated the white and black fourth class in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points that the children of both groups have reached has grown in this time period, the difference with now has barely decreased by 58 points.
Last week, some district education advocates expressed their concern that the results that were celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were preceded by most of the white students, who are still powerful children.
This indicates that we have raised the overall assessment by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that enters Washington D.C. for equality of education.
I am not jumping up and down for a team of two or three points, the democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton Ground School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the checkpoints is that the city's secondary schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs I respect.
What scares me, however, is that we do not use the time and energy that we need to use for our secondary school.
Rhee said the district needs to continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak students.
In this fall, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new lesson plan, the Wilson-Lese system, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary schools, which did not master the basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school course and the significantly behind their similar classrooms.
Daily mathematics, a teaching plan that focuses on the background of games and life-threatening experiences from the kindergarten to the sixth grade, was brought to Washington by former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this teaching plan is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to make the best of the measures available to students who are below the level of needs, Rhee said.
Others say that the results of NAEP highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and can continue to provide additional money and resources for the weak schools that are necessary to reduce the tide.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, investigates the city's results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The aim could be to create political consequences that work against this important agenda item.
Of course, as with other city school inspectors, the focus is that they try to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the urban districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the service gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington to compete with the charter schools.
The school year must be increased to about 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement over 185 days a year with his teachership, which he considered to be "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than the future
The bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, climbs up and shines a moment in view of the white columns, the brick tiles and the emerald green race.
Gracielas parents have hardly finished the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was buried in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set a foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight classes of the group, the Gettysburg researching, where the teaching costs $38.690 per year, was more than that of an ambitious visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" said Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when the low teacher-to-student ratio of the school was reported.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th, which the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully included the intended message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children of Spanish immigrants born in the United States, who do not end high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand there are also hundreds of thousands who receive college education, which is necessary to rise to the middle level.
In fact, one of the five "second generation" of Hispano-Americans closes the college – which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, usually from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having finished high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the labour force of the country.
Those who study powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for the school and an in-house drive to succeed.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of confidence in American schools.
But consultation programmes also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children as they help to get to college, especially if these efforts continue over a longer time.
If you consider weak income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find out through the system, then a single measure at some point will not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who examined Hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program that had financed Gracielas College tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - a step higher - and makes more than $300 million a year available for local school systems to start college preparatory programs that start when poor income students are in high school and continue until they have finished high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of whom more than 60% went to college.
Iraq's Ministry of Oil concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to re-establish its damaged infrastructure in two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil close to the fact that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been affected by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 increased fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for their participation in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only company that has issued a bid has pulled the shorts.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields raised in June.
In the opening of the Iraqi oil industry, the analysts were surprised by the thinly seated representatives of American oil mills.
Finally, after 6 years of war, Iraq opened its doors and instead of US companies, Asian and Europeans set out the way, Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, said an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns that were still highlighted by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability by the withdrawal of the US military have probably prevented American oil companies from doing so, analysts said to engage more strongly in Iraq, which has the third largest proven oil reserves in the world.
In some cases, US firms were disadvantaged because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and take risks because they do not have to charge shareholders.
Exxon Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, which maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and which have been sidelined with the technical Council in recent years, have failed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts promised this weekend.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, the speaker of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the world's largest economies and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure itself with its partners and its obligations towards Iraq will be fulfilled.
For the award of the pre-selected companies, orders were issued which were then compared to the charge per Barrel Oil, which the Ministry was willing to pay in order to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Kaida manifestly killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US missile attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan this week, a top deployment planner of Al Kaida was killed, as reported by representatives of the U.S. Counter-Terrorism on Friday.
This would be, if it were to confirm, the second deadly attack on a highly responsible terrorist organization in this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were to be killed by a number of rockets, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region, which hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in North-Waziristan Province on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired from a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's illegal tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a representative of a Pakistani civilian secret service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals who are suspected of being among the militants, ran to the scene and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism campaign had unspecified evidence that Somalia belonged to the dead.
Somalia was described as a leading military planner of Al Kaida, leading terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in all over the world, noticed a leading official who wanted to remain anonymous, and referred to the hot character of the U.S. air raids on Pakistani soil.
If one accepts its central role as given, this included planning attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and turned them into operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. representative said that Somalia was quickly established in the Al-Qaida hierarchy and maintained best connections to other extremist groups in the region.
He must not be known to some Americans, said the second representative of the authorities, but this does not reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death had been confirmed, Somalia would have been the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader who had been killed since September when a similar attack by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed.
The pace of the attacks by the CIA's Drones has since summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website that has been visited by a non-profit organization, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline may be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their accessibility and at the same time brutally kill suspected informants, the page reported.
Head of UN envoys in Kabul to retreat
The leading UN envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would return from his office in March, thus ending a stormy period of office that was interrupted by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-supported Afghan presidential election.
Any departure takes place when the Obama government has decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed concern that the US military withdrawal timetable, which should start in 18 months, could lead other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of Afghan security forces and therefore send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also forced the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help with the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not lower his office, but only fulfill one of his family's agreements in March 2008 to remain in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to notify UNO
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now leads him to have time to make a replacement.
What I've said is that he's starting to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban, according to UN representatives, has begun looking for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that it has taken into account the Swedish-Italian staff of Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who has led the UN peacekeeping operations.
One position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and misappropriating evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all charges, but he also said that the charges of Galbraith - who was fired - "the mission has certainly suffered damage because there was already a large amount of Skeps in relation to international integration in the election".
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the assistance measures of the US-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also stressed that the UN leadership would allow its successor to appoint more staff from the United States and other Western countries that contributed to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the current UN settlement regimes have undermined its ability to introduce people.
The UN rules have been so designed that since May, he said only one person could be set up.
This is a disaster and must not go on like this.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran has to take additional sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon be forced to "significant additional sanctions" over Iran because he did not participate in talks about his atoms.
Gates spoke during a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and played the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options to choose, he said in response to the question of a soldier's probability of such a development.
"One of the things that lie in my soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, which is our own unpredictability to the war."
The Obama government is considering a sanctions package aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" was needed to "to convince the Iranian government that it is in reality less protected by nuclear weapons", because "his people will suffer indiscriminately" under the sanctions.
On Friday, an opinion by the speaker of the White House, Robert Gibbs, agreed with the American government to warn European top politicians that Iran must face "cruel" consequences if it fails to comply with the requirements of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Authority, with its nuclear programme.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should be gained only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume the talks to limit its nuclear programme and would ignore a substantial part of its storage capacity in enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has insisted on this type of agreement in order to build confidence between the two parties and make time for negotiations.
However, since that time, Iran seems to have left the negotiations to the provisional agreements -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is inconvenient about whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community in relation to some of the proposals which it had already agreed to in early October has made it clear that the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, has brought together in a way that it has never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama set the 31 December deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before continuing to pursue other options, including those called "expressive sanctions" by Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian representative of the United Nations condemned what she called on some security council members on Thursday "unfounded and baseless claims" to the Iranian nuclear activities and said they were willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers to "a suitable long-term solution".
Gates, who was supposed to return to Washington on Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he fled to the mountainous Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, especially with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates forced both sides to lower the conflict potential to prevent delays in the US plans, to reduce the US troops' strength by the end of August from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to dissipate Kurdish concerns about the upcoming withdrawal of troops. U.S. representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will receive your security, well-being and autonomy within a single Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A Change of Course in Older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons have learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than a child, their answer was immediate and final: "No case".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child, nothing is left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of a child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notorious, derogated, single children, who are lovingly called "small emperors", a population crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate is 1.8 children per pair compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UNO
The population division is determined, while the number of population groups aged 60 and older in 2020 is expected to rise from 16.7 per cent of the population to 31.1 per cent of the population by 2050. This is far above the global average of approximately 20 per cent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older have grown almost 22 percent of the reported residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate is below one child per pair.
Xie Lingli, leader of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples need to get in the birthable old babies to "help reduce the proportion of older populations and alleviate the labour shortages of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "so old -- however not as rich -- as the industrial countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the constitution of the country in 1978, China's One Child Policy should probably be the most controversial issue introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate these policies must face enormous fines -- up to their three-fold annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese national representatives have attributed this policy to avoiding the critical challenge of the natural resources of the country, against which human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the implementation of the policy.
In rural areas, some pregnant women who already had a child have been forced to leave.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an innately high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards a child's policy.
In 2004, they accepted more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was recorded.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said government representatives had recently discussed more radical changes, for example allowing couples to have two children with a single child.
Shanghai was the first Chinese city in July to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Plates, which taught families to have only one child, were replaced almost overnight by directives that describe in detail who comes in for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and move information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not just encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Depressing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the external areas of Shanghai said that there is a gap in the requests of couples who want a second child after the campaign begins, the urban districts do not notice any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, for example, only four to five applications are still per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births expected for 2010 in the city will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Shanghai Family Planning Committee Municipality Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don't want to have any more children.
They want to give her first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that would also be legal.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a small amount of government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West consider a child policy false as a human rights question, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yeah, you rob us of the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their vows.
Wang, the staff leader, said she only wanted a child, because she was also a single child. "We were the family's center and used to take care of each one of us.
We are not used to caring for others and we don't really want this."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unmistakably.
For parents from the middle level with a double career through which the birth rate decreases, he said, it turns out to be successful and you have to be selfish about it.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to fight their parents during the early days of the Chinese capitalist experiment and they didn't want a life like that for themselves, he said.
Also, a single child, he said, poses huge demands at the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life plan -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a life course for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to do this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
UNO Group drafts emission reduction plan
The UN-supported climate conference -- which has so far been marked by wild poses and mutual accusations -- has again put a focus on the Friday with the publication of a document, which will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas for the next 40 years, with industrial nations in the near future having to shoulder the greatest burdens.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gas, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiations that will take time, as more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive next week in Copenhagen.
The text, which was formulated by a particular UN working group for this purpose, is about the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature increase that political decision-makers would contribute.
The process will provide great flexibility, as John Coequiyt, the lead representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page long negotiating text to focus on what the leading climate protection representative of the UN, Yvo de Boer, called "the great crowd".
It shows the basis for a possible agreement by which the industrial nations together would reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020, compared with the limits of 1990, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent at the same time.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Community has also given talks on Friday a boost through its assurance to provide US$ 3.6 billion per year over the next three years to support poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from the master of flooding and droughts to the prevention of deforestation.
On Friday, however, he brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the discussions last week.
U.S. Climate Commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations that require binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger developing countries, if not financed by industrial nations.
This train announced that Obama's government had a stronger line with China than the Bush government's representative not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging countries and taking action, such as stars, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion an hour after the Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei declared that it was either a lack of "reason" to the leading US climate trader or a "highly irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
Because the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake, there have been broken lines between industrial nations as well as between industrial nations and emerging countries.
The current struggle is similar to the rescue of individual economies, as well as the rescue of the planet, where China and the United States are responsible for their respective obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the great powers were fighting who should bear the costs of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction, since even affected countries have gone beyond that, aggressively taking the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their actions.
This is clearly a game in which a new economic leadership will develop, so is Ulate, who is also a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will best lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 members presented a 24-page draft contract on Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who conducts the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensives of small island states "implemented political pressure on the whole political process," partly because they are now united and calling for action from the emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks received a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open issues still need to be clarified before the government leaders arrive to reach agreement.
High-level representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, fly their planes and run through the halls of the Bella Center to meet behind closed doors and press conferences to cover claims negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people go to the Congress Centre every day and perform night shows by guitar players, where they smile at the countries that, in their opinion, are being betrayed and sold, and contract designs are hand-in-hand instead of hand-in-hand via e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity only builds on: almost all important ministers are here now and from Wednesday will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to Oberliga, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The weight is coming.
Britain's first 225 km/h fast train defines the monday feeling new
On Monday morning at 5:13 a.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a delivery that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed drive in the country will reach 225 km/h to London St. Pancras and will be back 93 km in 38 minutes when you travel from Ashfort, Kent.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then Dame Kelly Holmes will be on board the first Javelin brusher service from London.
He hopes that the new United Kingdom service will finally be connected to an international rail network of faster, reliable trains and connect the major areas of the Mediterranean, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living pendants, working hours would be reduced radically and the exchange of aircraft and cars on the train would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the streets.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of UK funds needed to build a new national rail network could still bring the brakes to the British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January, which will present a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will report on 30 December, according to the Times.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned level of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line that London is to connect with the West Midlands will pass with a five-metre playing area in urban areas and in places where the environmental impact is disputed.
In the free area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, north-east leading high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is an Y-shaped route where a single high-speed line would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would be shared in or near Birmingham and a retreat would lead west of the Pennys to Manchester and Scotland and another towards Northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today over an hour.
The drafts offer the train the possibility to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, which would make the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was designed so that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can ride on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This would also mean that in London an end station would be necessary, on which 20,000 travellers could be made per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing railway station is expected to be built to accommodate the high-speed network.
Train experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will be informed whether or not this plan should be continued, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures will mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he puts the wheels in motion, the rail network needs to be built in sections.
The trains had to first switch from the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would continue the journey between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered a crucial point in order to ensure a change from the plane to the train, a measure of guidance for the rail revolution.
Tax payers come for mortgages for 75,000 pounds of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading under-house member of the conservatives, has taken into account the tax payer for thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an orange, which he can build in his home in his constituency.
The prison spokesman of the party that David Cameron was degrading because he complained that the sub-house members had to live "from lean rations" had increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds in order to build a oak wood plant at his second house in Rutland.
He could account for the taxpayer's additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The directors of the sub-house approved the applications at that time, and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Läg, who carried out a review of the expenses of the sub-house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could be "not even more clean or understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest members of the house, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency Rutland and Melton.
Nearly all houses have reached a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a publishing office in the basement, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he built a winter garden, which is called "orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "Glasshaus for Entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked to take an opinion on the increase in cash during a recent study of his previous mortgage agreements by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The Committee released it last month following an examination of its expenditure from the infringement of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security of a mortgage of 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his election hall, which he had purchased a year before he was elected as a member of Parliament.
This week's published documents show that Duncan has recovered about 1,400 pounds per month as a hypothecens in the last year by March.
In April, its claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS-Hypothek has not changed during this time, which shows that the total increase was used to finance the collection of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal phaseless RBS hypothesis fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the Sub-House show that Duncan continued to apply to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month in this May.
Duncan lost his post in September as the opposition leader of the Undercover House after filming him when he said after the release scandal that members of Parliament would live "from lean rations".
"In essence, it means working for the state that you have to live on lean rations and how S*****e is treated."
He said, “I have spent my money on my garden, and I am demanding a small part of it, according to what I hear.”
And I could have asked for the whole damn sum, but I don't do it."
The Parliament member, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked for his expenditure in May when it became clear that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden before he had concluded with the Fees Office that this could be considered "as an overriding claim".
As a protest activist in Duncan's Rasen, a hole was dug in the form of a pound sign, after it was known that he had requested 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years away.
When he was asked last night about the increased mortgage, Duncan said, "This was both approved by the Fees Office, and the following was approved by the Law of the Increase."
He added: "There is no debate on deviations and lengths or a combination of rules or similar.
Everything is fully transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not even be cleaner and clearer."
Come all your believers to admire Brighton's beach sheltered adventure calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new content of life for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that attracts spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on 1 December and visitors were allowed to watch the latest huts every day from 17:30 to 18:30 at free glass wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dried fruit.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The First Christmas", while here the hidden decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Howe, is an honorary spiritualist of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we expect people as a church to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and celebrate with enthusiasm.
The idea of the beach shelter agenda began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to seek an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have held several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police, hundreds of thousands of organizers, are marched into the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which should lead to a conclusion that could come into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for climate contributes to what these demonstrations show that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed completely in black, had broken windows with patchstones and hammers, a journalist of the AFP stated.
Anti-unrest policemen have attacked immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that between 600 and 700 people, according to your estimate, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, were arrested by these extremely violent splitter groups, which have already been famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in the East of France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has taken the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were "without distinction", sharply criticised, and stressed that about one hundred of you "were always detained in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with gloves and in position.
The rather peaceful train went from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the scheduled speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators were engaged in buses and trains from the major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with blue rainforests, have made a first run in Copenhagen in the morning, as you are following the call of the friends of the earth to form "blue weather" for the "climate justice".
Today we go to the streets to ask for a recovery of ecological debt in favour of the south, Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen, explained.
We can't go on and tell ourselves: we have time, meant Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, where water flows can be washed, as has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
The European Commissioner José Bové, like the globalisation critic, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific Space, where many islands are at risk from warming, has provided the starter for demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people went to the streets according to the organizers in Australia.
In Manila there were a few hundred people, mostly students who are marched into the red and have hit bandanas, in which you have glorified the sun energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, a series of hundreds of demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, some people gathered.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia complains that it is a strike here.
Abkhazia elected his president on Saturday, which happened a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as being self-recognised, Tbilisi denounced the "strike".
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war to control the South-Ossetian region, another Georgian secessionist area, recognised by Russia.
The lobby closed at 17.00 GMT.
The election was about 58% a few hours before the election, according to the Abkhaz election commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on Sunday night from Saturday.
The five candidates, including the former President, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of a reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, according to the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, that Abkhazia is now under total Russian occupation, his press spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze, explained.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world is part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After the 1992-1993 conflict had separated from Georgia, with thousands of people dying, Abkhazia would like to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen for Herrn Bagapch, has explained.
She was one of the voters who went to choose a room in a school in the capital of Soukhumi, choosing a beautiful white building with a few palm trees before the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
A large sign on which the Bagapch is to be seen on the side of the Russian President and the head of the government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, is located everywhere in this small area that has 216 000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is on the east side of the country, the District Chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said in a small celebration, as a reminder of Moscow's support, in particular with regard to the decision to recognise Abkhazian independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, replied and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements that had been reached with Moscow in the previous year, as those in Abkhazia Russia left control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the current government or opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide on Saturday to seek an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready to use, have taken about 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, hundreds of thousands of organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon colds in the Danish capital, which have received delegates from 193 countries until December 18th, looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peace train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to interfere.
A stage was built to welcome the scheduled speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train was over, a group of demonstrators who were completely dressed in black and were armed with backstones and hammers began to hit the disc, a journalist of the AFP said.
Anti-inflicted police officers have immediately recruited you and attacked you without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that between 600 and 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mostly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups that have already been famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, East France, in April.
On the other hand, a police officer suffered an injury by a patchstone during the incidents in which, according to the police, about twenty persons were temporarily arrested. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups in the grip," explained the police speaker Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces in the air.
Most demonstrators who traveled by train or by car from German cities, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the blue raincoat, formed themselves in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group that the "blue sea" should represent for "climate justice".
"Today we go on the road to demand that ecological debts be repaid to the people of the south," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say any more : we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that thrive, there are watercourses through which one can run, which was never the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation opponents has approached environmental protection organisations.
The French Member of the European Parliament and Globalisation Critic José Bové explained to the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer any difference today between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turns to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific space, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given rise to demonstrations.
In Australia, about 50,000 people went to the street following the words of the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed red with bandanas, made advertising in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
During the demonstrations organized by the network of 350 in France, several hundred people, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east, joined together.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
The fields of geography and history go according to Chatel strengthened from the school reform of the lycées.
National Education Minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview that appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du Dimanche" that the fields of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the lycées, even if they are not mandatoryly taught in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) now have all four hours of the same program," says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister "must be overcome by this apparentness", because after him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in large and in whole a concentration "the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientist," he continued. He stressed: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who have been impressed by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lycenes."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in humanity criticised nearly seven of ten French (69%) the state project of eliminating compulsory teaching in history and geography in Terminal S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also miss out on this project, as well as on the left and some representatives of the rights.
The Minister replied that there was no question of a restriction of the philosophy of the terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) for Tuesday called for a protest against the project, which they believe falls to the victim following the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister indicated that they were under the supervision of Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year of a specialist qualification examination and at the end of the year of an approval examination which examined their teaching skills.
They also conduct practice during the year in M2 and then teach a year before the students as teachers in practice.
He continued: "If you add all the practices offered before the performance test, you will reach even more hours that you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "something that does not exist in education."
He once again confirmed that he wanted to cancel the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Superiore"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the use on the summit of Copenhagen: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change" had to deal with at the Ecole Normale Superiore in Rue d'Ulm in Paris on Saturday morning.
As a journalist of the AFP found, peace Nobel Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, where experts each turn to the public for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One would like to do something about reaching people and raising the feeling of wanting to learn more, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the names given by the students to the fish in the school's pool.
"Among the experts were selected for the twenty participants, even after their charisma," he said.
"Climate heating can be used for hours. However, the core objectives can also be presented in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke only with the help of Folien, about 50 people before.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the audience would like to understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos affected by these conferences will be available online from December 15th on the school side.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Transfer of payments : angry prison sentences, planned actions
The trade unions of criminal law officials have called on a general day of action on Friday to ensure that the prizes and overtimes for which payments have been made for budgetary reasons until January are passed before Christmas.
The second trade union of criminal law enforcement officials ("FO-Penitentiaire") called on the employees who did not have a service to demonstrate on Tuesday morning before the criminal law enforcement agency and block them to pay attention to "the steel that belongs to them".
The 3rd union of criminal law enforcement officials ("CGT-Penitentiaire") called for "to join a strong mobilization in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of the overtime, nighttime visits, and the sun and holidays in December are marked as "silful and unacceptable".
The first trade union of criminal law enforcement officials, the Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the Criminal Tribunal and the Ministry of Justice stated that the overtime was high in 2009 and that not all were provided for in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As told by the Ministry of Justice in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the trade unions of law enforcement officials guaranteeing payment in the next month.
"I know very well about the efforts of staff to keep our criminal service system functioning and modernise," the Minister of Justice said in this letter.
"I have instructed the head of the criminal prosecution centre to take immediate action so that a situation such as the lack of estimation of the overtime is not repeated in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
Thus, the December salary is lower, except for the management staff who enjoy high service and target awards, the UFAP/UNSA explains for which the "financial support" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal", the interregional FO trade union in Marseille is forced to boycott "all collections and calls" up to new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and holidays when the hours of October are still not paid in December. This is also true of their overtime", also threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"At a time when we are getting more and more jobs done without more staff being set up, the attempt is to enrich the staff's money more than inadequate," said the CGT trade union of Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions. Some are less affected than others.
However, in any case it is wrong, the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget, states.
Obama is the view that he spends Christmas always better gifts than he gets himself.
The American President, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has announced to the TV speaker Oprah Winfrey that he always shares better gifts than he gets himself.
The president and his wife, Michelle, gave an overview of how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrative home on Sunday evenings.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog also receives a gift.
Michelle Obama decided to return her husband's claim to the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she denied the president.
"So please," he scolded her and pointed out to the pearl chain of First Lady, "and who gave it to you there?"
During this one-hour exposure in an uncompromising atmosphere with the well-known television moderator, Barack Obama, who had so strongly supported during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts she loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bike with ten walks and also a basketball that his father, whom he had rarely seen, had brought from Kenya to Christmas.
"I remember when my father once visited us on Christmas and brought me a basketball," the president said.
"For the first time in my life, I realized that I had this ball from him."
The first Lady remembered her home.
"I didn't even know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operates, RTL confirms that he was transferred to the artistic coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles due to significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was moved to the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Wednesday night after the American doctors "damaged due to the operation of a tape disc incident", which he had suffered in Paris on November 26th, so his production company in Paris added that these injuries had made a new operation necessary.
However, the producer company of the singer wanted to make it clear that the situation was "under control" and shared that a new medical opinion would be available at least in 48 hours.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, however, Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma to avoid "pangs and complications".
However, only after 48 hours, there was a little more certainty about the patient’s condition than he opened his eyes, added RTL.
At the request of the AFP, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources", that after his first operation in Paris, "no drainage" was introduced.
The Rocker was operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a tape incident.
The surgery planned over several days was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday night for comments against RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's operation, the singer was delivered to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital on Monday in Los Angeles due to a follow-up infection after surgery.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, was in front of RTL on Thursday the view that his friend was going through a "deep valley" right away. However, he assured you that you would need "no worries" to make the rock musician because this is "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him that it was stupid to put himself in a plane for 12 hours after such an operation, which is not going to go," Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday was "well responsive to antibiotics" and that the infection was "infected".
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he did not feel particularly concerned about it.
Nevertheless, the concern for the health of the singer has been growing since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he was injured in his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small Darmcrebs-OP", which resulted in a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer took up his long " Tour 66" as a separate tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented outlying. Fans and journalists have not gone away that the singer had to move on stage.
By mid-November, the people surrounding him had to dementate a new delivery to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet about its favourite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 World Championships, won an international title on Thursday on his favorite distance, 50m Fristil, at the Euro-2009 short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, on which the polyurethanes were last allowed, there were only three world records, while a true record flow was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Surprise over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m.
Damage to Bousquet, who wanted to take after the world record at the 50m freestyle, whose record he held in the big basin (20.94).
At one of the two king's distances in the swimming style, 50m-freestyle, the 28-year-old Francoise was claimed in 20.53 sec., in a final with ten swimmers at the beginning (usually there are eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatians Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe more and more, and in the present case, if the world record is within my reach, I will try it."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their Epos in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination has not been paid this time for the German Paul Biedermann, twice world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and World Record, at the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has spent the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I haven't given everything this time.
I knew I could not get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my job."
"Lobintsev will be a more serious opponent in the future," Biedermann explained.
USA : Zola engraving plate estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman engraving plate, calculated by the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated on Thursday at 1.5 million US dollars over its value, so the art dealer Sothebys.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the third century to Christ and has always been valued with 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of dionysus are depicted in a sophisticated architecture deck, surrounded by satires and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, Vice President for the Protection of Roman and Egyptian Antiquities at Sotheby's, said on Tuesday against the AFP.
It was sold in hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is certainly what buyers have been offering the most for so far," says Sotheby's speaker, Dan Arnethy against the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of marble by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family at home, and then she played piece for pieces with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who found use in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshall Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "Emile Zola harvest", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the "Rougon-Macquart" fresco.
Zelayas exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been avoided
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the oppressed Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soils as no longer agreed, having rejected this guidance by the Putsch government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place at night, it seems at present that there is a disagreement about the possibilities of this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, explained.
According to the immigration authority, the plane which was operated by the Mexican government in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of M. Zelayas was returned to its original location.
The Putsch government wanted Mr. Zelaya to be "thank you" and seek political asylum for him abroad.
However, the President-in-Office refused this because he wished to return to Mexico as the host, an official head of state.
The Putsch regime "has suffered a renewed failure by wanting to move me to my costs (...), they wanted me to thank," said M. Zelaya on Thursday against Radio Globo, in which he has often reported himself since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here well and like to stay here for ten years, here I have my guitars, added the offended president who had fled to the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under attacks of some agreement.
The Mexican message has provided us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, as it does not contain a petition for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the Putsch Government, told the Honduran Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I didn't even ask for asylum, Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible exit from Honduras, he had stressed, he would only be the president of the Hondurasan people.
On Wednesday, Mr. Zelayas had mobilized the supporters of the oppressed president, who had stood up for the Brazilian message and had gathered around them, and the military there had strengthened his use.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the Putsch government.
This, so his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was upset on 28 June, on the day of the referendum organized by him to prepare for his re-election, against the Council of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
He returned from his exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves this, he will be arrested for his high-level conspiracy, which he is accused of by justice, so the Putsch government.
The Putsch President Roberto Micheletti managed to organise a presidential election on 29 November in order to settle Mr Zelaya.
In the course of the contested election, Porfirio Lobo was recognised by the United States, but rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had massively voted against M. Zelayas' return to office until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street in the wake, the US trade balance nourishes optimism
On Thursday, the New York Stock Exchange concluded with a high figure, the figures of the US trade balance are proof of a course recovery of the shares of the United States and its partners: Dow Jones contributed 0.67%, Nasdaq was 0.33%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased from 68,78 points to 10,405,83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7,13 points to 2,190,06 points.
The extended Index Standard & Poor's 500 was attributed to 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from different industries, determined Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-glasses", so she messed.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily fixed on the figures of the US trade balance, "which shows an improvement of activity in the fourth quarter".
The trade deficit in the United States decreased by 7.6 % in October to $32.9 billion.
On the contrary, the analysts had calculated a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great novelty is the increase in the overall volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, as commented Christopher Cornell from the company research Economy.com.
In contrast, the unemployment reports in the United States have increased in the last week against all expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000 applications.
However, during the last four weeks, the average value of new jobseekers has been "falling at the bottom of the year", said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisor.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of State bonds up to 10 years is increased to 3,482 % compared to 3,432 % on the day of service, the profitability of the bonds up to 30 years to 4,492 % compared to 4,408 % on the night before.
Cuba: Hundreds of Power- Standing Partisans Pfeifen "Dams in Weiss"
On Thursday, a few hundred Cuban partisans, the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Day of Human Rights, as well as foreclosures, were temporarily arrested by a good dozen dissidents.
For the forty women in Weiss, married women or close political prisoners, they were executed on the open street of partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the march to the center of the capital to seek the release of the political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Lower with the Yankies!, "Säldner!", "The road belongs to the revolutionarys!", "There live Fidel and Raul!", the powerful partisans with raised Faust scolded the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilians who appeared to "guarante their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "ladies in Weiss" had been played in Havana on the night before, where there were neither injured nor arrested.
On the other hand, in the port city of Vedado, a dozen dissidents were arrested temporarily by civilian police, as well as the demonstration held on Thursday in view of the International Human Rights Day, confirmed by an AFP reporter.
According to this journalist, the government-based dissidents have forced them to enter civil vehicles under force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As advocates at the 2005 Sakharov Prizes given by the European Parliament, the "women in Weiss" have an unauthorized appeal for the "Pray for the Freedom of All Political Prisoners", whose number according to the list of dissidents has been held by about 200 people, Laura Pollan, one of the leaders, whose husband Hector Maceda has been in prison for 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of which up to 53 girls are sitting behind.
The Cuban authorities felt that the regimes were "soldners" or "agents" in the service of the declared enemy, the United States.
A rare fact is that Cuban television provided a report on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and counter-revolutionarys.
A single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of emanating rights and freedoms, especially freedom of opinion.
Undefeated kills eight-year-olds with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
On Friday against late afternoon, a two-hundred-hundred-and-a-hundred-and-a-half-six-year-old man killed a man in the middle of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and injured five others.
According to the first figures of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eight-year-olds for an unexplained reason in or before an apothecary on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knifers and this, according to police records, under the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, was reported to have suffered the consequences of his injuries in the hospital, according to an officer of the Police Institute Alliance.
In or before the same apothecary, he married a couple of pregnant women.
The man, about in the triangles, entered and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured in the hospital, where the eight-year-old died.
The other injured swims in danger of life, since, according to him, police sources, apparently concerned vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become ill because of the events and she should have been hospitalized in the "sock state" according to a police officer.
The armed man, who seemed to be under alcohol or drug influence after police reports, should be on the road, the same Boulevard Jean Jaires.
He would have injured two other passengers, apparently by chance: a three-and-a-half-year-old and a forty-year-old, with the last of the two.
The scenario stayed in the dark at night.
He had been armed with two meat meters, which he had crossed behind his back, on the site of Arnaud Pressé, a union officer Alliance of the skin-de-Seine area.
Several passengers, including young people, should have tried to stop the crazy people, according to the testimony reports found by the AFP.
I saw a guy in the triangles with a green west.
Three young people tried to step in.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, Alberto reported, a basement of a nearby bar.
A horn fell on him, he added, including a city police officer who broke the wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of house number 61, two city policemen, including her supervisor, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knives, so police records.
The event took place in one of the main battles of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there were a number of shops.
Passants have come to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I put them in the first aid station and noticed a striking wound in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old apothecary, the AFP.
Five minutes later a second person, about three-year-old, was injured by cutwives.
State police forces have finally arrested the man who did not carry any paper.
The National Prosecutor of Nanterre has commissioned the district reference of the Criminal Police Division Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) with the case statement.
The crazy person was hospitalized on Thursday evening.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been found in court.
A police officer does not assume that he is being delivered to a nervous hospital.
According to another police source, it forced six policemen to arrest him at the police station in Clichy, where he was taken away.
He was "in a state of exaggeration" as "all spiritual controversies of this kind, in which the forces were released during the tathering".
USA: Polanski's lawyer requests re-establishment of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has asked for the repeated occasion on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to drop the prosecution against his commanders, who is currently in his place of residence in Switzerland due to a sit-down trial of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", urged three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California to make serious procedural errors at the time of negotiations in 1977.
I asked for a sentence, M. Hummel said before adding that the behaviour of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was in charge of the case at the time of the trial, was "let a cold run down the back".
According to him, the - in the meantime - judge of the Rittenband, before his trial, discussed with a state attorney who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski had earned a Zuchthaus -- which represents a serious procedural error.
This discussion was launched in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and wanted" (Roman Polanski: pursued and desired), particularly by the inquiring state attorney David Wells.
Mr Wells had finally declared at the end of September that the authors of the documentary film had "remunerated".
If the Court of Justice rejects the imposition of the criminal procedure, Mr Hummel asks for the conduct of a process which would enable him to provide evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, on the other hand, has repeated the evidence already stated in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the removal of the defendant's cargo stocks cannot be seriously taken into account, as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, even before the publication of the penalty for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
Since then, he has not traveled to the United States.
The deputy state attorney of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, explained that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the negotiations".
Would you like to spread the message on this subject, and not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, who are a means of escape?, Mrs. Asayma asks.
According to your opinion, the filmmaker asks the court for a case and thus disregards its authority.
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to make their decision known – even said, "there are other options to escape".
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the imposition of the persecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the abolition of the criminal procedure.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear it to be offended by any recurrence of the Polanski affair and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was right.
Two and thirty years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September at the launch of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to a possible house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is suspended by the rise of the dollar and closed without a course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed off on Friday without a course, in a market which between better indicators than in the US and an increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, and Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65,67 points to 10,471,50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq 0.55 points to 2,190,31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Shortly, the market is rather quiet," said Mace Blickilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"He remains very limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which " contributed to improving market view of the solidarity of the recovery of the economy", joined the analysts of Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, so that two months had elapsed and far more than expected.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers has improved significantly in December, compared to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan index preview.
However, the indices have been hampered by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level against the euro for two months, thus 'pressing down the sectors that are vulnerable to the economic situation', said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost something on the ground.
The bond market has returned.
The rate of the shadow lease over 10 years has increased by 3,540 % over 3,482 % on Wednesday night and the loan over 30 years to 4,497 % over 4,492 % of the day.
Re-elected Miss World in South Africa
After a month of traveling through South Africa, the 112 candidates, entitled to Miss World on Saturday, will exceed the last watch to realize their dream: to be chosen for the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this for a billion television.
During these great beauty fairs, which will be held for the second time in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already booked their ticket to the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were cut during her African stay to Miss Sportive or also Miss Top Model.
This was a real thrill of pleasure.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Kap Hoorn, was simply exceptional.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had every experience, Miss Sierra Leone said with great enthusiasm.
This competition takes place nine times in South Africa and will be delivered live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17 a.m. to 5 p.m.
I couldn't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, Mrs. World Ksenia Sukhinova stressed in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russians, their second residence in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the re-discovering of "abrasive landscapes".
After a month of galas, samples, encounters with the press and Safari, the bride now concentrates on the competition.
The Indian Poja Chopra hopes to enter the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, which was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as Ashwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and were both Bollywoodstars.
It is of course the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about the appearance here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a wide smile.
According to the organizer, this 59th edition will be underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defiling in traditional costumes and not forgetting, in the bath suit.
The performance is presented by a television moder, Chinese Angela Chow, by the former beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and by a director of Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it receives the world with a little overpowering heart and pride, Julia Morley, president of Miss World, assures.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visiting the famous Township in Soweto, but this time it cost with the bike and the local kitchen.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them his hand, was quite exceptional.
Not usually for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, undoubtedly remains the release in Cape Town (Southwest) to the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to buy something more for this event.
I'm wrong with people that I could probably never get closer to.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Championship, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is according to his son David "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", his son David assured on Friday at his arrival at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's all going very well, David Hallyday explained the press when he got out of the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 13 a.m. local time (21 a.m.M.) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxing impression, assured that he would "fastest" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, in which Johnny Hallyday was delivered to Paris on Monday because of a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a tape disc incident on November 26th.
The singer was "this night in Los Angeles in an artificial coma to relieve his severe pain and be able to perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma in which he was delivered to Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection after a tape surgery on 26 November.
The singer had to undergo a new operation during the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of the recent intervention.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school event in the French gymnasium of Los Angeles in which her daughter Jade went to school on Friday morning.
The head of the Orthopedic and Traumatological Surgery Department at the Pitie-Salpétrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer heavily charged the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer in the Clinique international du park Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
We were told he set up the purest massacrer.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were completely upset, Mr. Camus explained.
I've heard that a court procedure might be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "is too fast and is travelling with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I personally called this doctor who assured me that he viewed this trip as completely unproblemable, which I was surprised to see, because I had already had two tape drives behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he began to know at RTL that the singer would have left the hospital apparently after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artist's environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was practicing at that time.
In 2007, he also operated the actor Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma after a brain bleed.
However, he is also a doctor with a questionable reputation, who has been convicted many times because of misoperations and not to forget, due to tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the medical counsel of the Chamber, referred to him as "one man without scruples" who has "regularly" responsibility before the Board and is "all other than recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would be "normal".
The operation "did not call for bleeding and therefore does not require drainage", he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been practicing since last summer, seems to be questioned.
It is quite clear that it is too short for a continuation of the tour on January 8th (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The party association UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and urges the party to stop using its seal
The party association, which is monitored by François Bayrou's Party MoDem, reacted strongly on Friday to a takeover attempt by the party, once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the side of the chairman of the party's New Centre, Hervé Morin, and urged him not to use this seal on a document no longer under threat of judicial persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, since he felt that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had reached the left hand.
The Minister of Defence, whose partner is the UMP, also wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In response to his efforts, he received the support of Senator Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC), who raised a claim to the ownership of the UDF brand, as he first applied for this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la prété industriale".
However, the business members of the UDF party association monitored by François Bayrous's friends broke down and made it clear that they were not fit and put the Minister and the deputy under threat of judicial persecution a time limit for the use of this seal and the transfer of the ownership of the brand.
In the last few days, you have made numerous statements that you would propose your political movement, the UDF seal + take over, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party, and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You probably also believed that you would have the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the slogan + of today's UDF + on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to the use of this seal, the UDF's office explained and called on the NC party to "remove immediately the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (her) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette requested "to transfer the ownership rights of the brand to its legal claims".
If you refuse this, we will raise complaints against you in order to comply with the law and in order to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In her letter, she stressed that "UDF "has been a full political movement since 1978 and recalls that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave 2007 to establish a competitive movement as it had already done in 2002 to establish the "UMP" party.
The New Centre Party therefore has, according to the signatory, no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to recall that the last UDF 2007 Congress has approved the three-year accession to MoDem Party and the establishment of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the business force continues, "at the time when he applied for the brand name, for three years no longer a member of the UDF" but the UMP.
It benefits in a scandalous and deceptive way, from the lack of the deposit of the acronym UDF to carry out this for itself.
Furthermore, remember that this lack of respect is in the best way to turn into a penalty, and ironically the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us in politics as well as in life more desirable to make a name ourselves, rather than to try to come out of the anonymity by resorting to a false name on which no legal claim has been made."
Affaire Liliane Bedencourt : François-Marie Banier is sentenced for abuse of weakness
The Court of Justice of Nanterre decided on Friday to assess the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether he, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, used a weak moment of the eight-year-old to make up a part of her assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photo, will have to be held accountable on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the abuse of weakness in court, a penalty punishable by a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that in fact there will be a process in this case that is worthy of the Saga of one of the richest families of France in which mothers and daughters are fatten and at the same time have the toes of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Chamber also arranged a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is conducted jointly by three doctors.
The Erbin and L'Oréal's main shareholder have so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions laid down by Nanterre's State Prosecutor's Office.
The doctors appointed on Friday will present a report before 10 March 2010 stating clearly whether and when Liliane Bettencourt may have found herself in a state of weakness.
I think she'll submit to these investigations.
I'm going to talk to her, the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, explained after the trial.
As far as the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner is concerned, he is very pleased with the court's decision.
This is an excellent novelty (...). The opinion will prove that he (banier) manipulated this old lady who needs protection, he confirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has filed a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of having used her mother's weakness for years to make sacrifices of a total of a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
She had always refused to be manipulated by the photographers, whom she viewed as a long-standing friend.
Although the court had to examine the admissibility of the complaint brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Mayers, the lawyers' lawyers led to a large family debacle on Friday.
So the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called on three of her clients to send letters to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she misjudged the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Mayers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please tell my daughter that I have written banners for fifteen years once to two times a day.
Françoise, I've never been able to speak since her hieracy."
The National Prosecutor of Nanterre once again believes that the complainant had no right to react in such a way, especially because a pre-trial judge has rejected her application in the last days to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no priormune.
No one has the right to act in their place," confirmed the representative of the State Prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court has now decided to issue a judgment after the procedure for the authorisation of Ms Bettencourt-Mayers took place.
Manager revolution or the end of the strategic early announcement?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence has been otherwise ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis consumers before the Marketing Revolution: It is the best thing for the staff to add "values" is how it was previously designed for the consumer products of the technicians at work.
By giving customers at the company centre the marketing revolution has given the strategies for the acquisition of the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separated Factors Customer preferences are repeatedly linked again!
Demobilization of employees can lead to a fatal demobilization.
The suicide of France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the top of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of F&Eund, which is even more decisive, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) "of all the parties involved (...) calls for a proactive approach and a future-oriented approach" ; it calls on employees to use a method which fully contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we are asking for an operational revolution that would exist to give employees equal rights over the company's concerns to the customer.
The very conditional benefits of internal questions of opinion
Will the internal questions of opinion, as the questionnaire that the Orange has presented to its payees, be encouraged by this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to find that, in view of a new situation, it is finally possible to do what has always been done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power-proportional increases the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a very simple idea of human behavior.
Its interpretation of psychology is mechanically derived from the major engineering schools.
They take over by intellectual comfort the old behaviorist theory recently reactivated by the American neurosciences and was unknowfully widely distributed by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to do the "Hebel" (sic) to engage employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey of Ipsos strengthens the leadership forces in a position to a mechanical control system that is inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies presupposes the adoption of a final view of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol into any discussion or practice of governance: for the recipient, the commitment for the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to achieve a part of its dreams, honors and projects.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take on this concept of motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their company on the basis of a given Doxa that allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the leadership of companies can control their "social performance", predict and predict and restore their human resource management in the right place.
They thus create a fertile soil that is beneficial for the proper development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "right war" brings Obama praise to the right
The U.S. rights on Friday welcomed the speech made by Barack Obama last night in Oslo and was pleased that the 2009 Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who had ridiculed Obama's award on October 9th praised the President's speech this time, following the example of the former Vice-President candidate in the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained that the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily USA Today and added that she herself brought the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war into the language of the memoirs published in her behalf.
Of course, the war is the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it's necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of violence; a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the view that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly recognized the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, this speech had been quite a historical experience, said Ginrich, who was questioned in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The former MP, considered by some as possible candidate for the 2012 presidential election for the Republican nomination, said he was pleased to see a "Presidents of the Left" who reminded members of the Nobel Committee that they "could not be free and could not exceed a price for peace if the use of violence did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and currently editor at Washington Post, Obama has kept "a very American speech".
In addition to being "cosmopolitan" as "he always does," he said "as an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "are living in a security bubble that they did not create themselves and do not do much for their protection," said Gerson.
Among the few unconvincing rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a Falke of the era Bush, spoke on the website of the National Review Online as "long, tally and insidious".
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the retreat to the forces of war.
If one packs the war under the cover of justice, the massacrer can simply justify the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left remains in favour of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still the view that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, referred to the address itself for a speaker like him who is known for his talent as "Monumental work".
The talk in Oslo "is a final plan to control international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", as the California daily is excited.
The New York Times believes that Obama "declared the necessary discourse" and refers to his speech as "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Distancer: Three Marathons for an agreement that ensures the provision of Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the Association of Roads and the Tlf - the only employers' organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday, which puts an end to the strike command and the threatening heavy supply pass at Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau welcomed the agreement which was launched on Wednesday after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second negotiation night, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in the hope that the agreement would be signed quickly in the late morning.
And although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTR) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the agreement was concluded and the agreement was signed only at 18:00.
The conflict "had added a lot of damage to the company" and "was to fear that he would affect the holiday at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest pay groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages therefore rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not very much, but we're just getting a little started," said Patrick Clos (FO).
The activists are now told not to block the supply centres anymore.
"But there will probably always be some opposition that are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF President Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "hard to avoid these wage increases in view of international competition".
According to him, the increase of 170 euros per month is for the low and of 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on a healthy human understanding and respect for the employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Doine (CFTC) spoke of "an historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) expressed himself in this regard "an acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also foresees an increase in travel costs by 3% and the maintenance of the overall road transport unit in the first half of 2010, which will, in particular, enable the 13-month topic to be addressed and the modernisation of tariff agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of the fees for employers amounting to EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment to the Government's draft legislation for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Thursday night.
The government calls for "an identical" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to be applied first to the companies attached to this organisation and subsequently to be applied in the case of an extension by the Minister of Labour for the whole professional status.
This will be "in the shortest time" of the case, insurance bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only exacerbate the procedure.
The FNTR association launched a "trafficking trade" because the 100 million euros "were already promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but not to grieve the Gans-Esser on the coming Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens "to strike a large grave for the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Unsatisfied disturbances this weekend, unions with the RATP proposals
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Greater Paris and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris people transport administration) allowed the strikers to continue to wait with their demands for wages.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas, no trains traveled between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central track (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and only one of four trains was ready for use outside the central track.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced the travelers to move up.
The Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "they are trying to connect the major businesses in traffic".
The RER A line passes the Paris ballroom from west to east.
The section of RATP connects the places Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of the two trains scheduled for the main traffic time, and almost no one during the short traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no human emotion on the railways, as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had settled on the situation.
As early as the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less overrun than anything else, especially due to the lack of gymnasiumists.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), explained that he would have been "up to one and a half hours earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, who had planned to care for the travelers by officials and law enforcement, pointed out that there were no roadblocks at Saint-Lazare Train Station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on line RER A or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut came on or off the Saint-Lazare train station to ensure the connection to the metros there.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strikers again took place, while the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified after meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon as "dark".
The RER manager proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (South), they are demanding a longer-term wage.
The CGT was encouraged that the RATP itself put its salary proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership was "not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible for the remoters and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting was scheduled for Monday for the "extensive examination of working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
On the morning of the day, about 150 drivers sought the release of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leadership point that rejected any discussion during the strike until then and brought about a meeting after the situation was calmed down.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the RER B line after a prior announcement of Unsa and independents.
The associations call for a pay premium of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents). They also complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers are travelling daily.
The RER line drivers with years of professional experience relate to a gross wage of EUR 2,200 to EUR 2,700 and a salary allowance of EUR 600 to 650 for shift services as well as sun and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court opens pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the resolution of the pro-Kurdish party of the country; a decision followed by the immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the Government extremely difficult, which is trying to reach the Kurdish Community to put an end to the 25-year conflict.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it became a "place for activities which are detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," said the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kilic four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kilic, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to hold the resolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the party's leadership, including President Ahmet Turk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were excluded for the duration of five years from political events.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, Turkey and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's property.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The leaders expressed themselves in favour of the ruling that parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than be partisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated by the Turkish Federal Court of Justice Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007. He accused the DTP of following the "discharges" of Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is regarded by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that there is "no connection" to the PKK, refuses to name them as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court is a matter for the Government, which seeks to oppose the Kurdish Community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to ensure the support of the PKK through the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The DTP leaders confirm that a resolution could lead to a recurrence of tensions in South-East Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of the PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to clashes with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP's premises in the millionth city of Diyarbakir in the southeastern part of Kurden.
The order forces put in gas grenades and water pumps when the demonstrators started throwing molotow cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the judgment, Turkey assumed that the court's decision "to further deepen despair".
"Turkey cannot explain this (Kurdish, d. editorial) question on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose in principle the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously react to the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK was known as an attack on which seven soldiers in the north of Turkey had been killed three days earlier. It was one of the most brutal attacks of the past months.
The snow may break
A really stupid winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to blackmail the citizens, says the FES Winter Service Manager.
In addition, his employees are able to test and master the whole vehicle technology.
In the weekend it could be so far from meteorologists for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is in line with a precise plan.
As soon as the temperatures are flat in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero, 20 so-called A-tracks will be taken off with large-scale vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include major roads such as the New Way and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firefighting, OPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with accidents such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres had to be stretched when needed for a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is better held.
This is why the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "so that the routes are free until occupational traffic starts".
It'll be hard if it's only 7:30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is ready to make room for the vehicles."
Only after, if it is not cut further, are the supply and disposal roads, which also include the Council's Bill Street, on the line.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, brewburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrians are on their way, risk points and transitions.
The FES could usually not take care of all the bike routes.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps the bridges in sight from 22 to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since it is on these fast floors, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the stretcher is on the way.
If necessary, they will also be called by the police.
The Waves of the Dinosaurs
Tawa Hallae looked like many other meat-flavouring dinosaurs: the two meters long and 1.50 meters large animal ran on two powerful hind legs, had a long shoulder with sharp, bent teeth, short arms with cyclists and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the magazine Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the Supercontinent Pangäa on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for the early evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us much about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbit and other palaeontologists began digging at the Ghost Ranch in North New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones on one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, team member Randall Irmis reports from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they brought together the rest of the rest of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi-Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an exceptional fund: "Dinosauri fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, usually only one fraction is found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
Especially spectacular is not this fund, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current teaching, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, so the allocation of these ur-dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the oaks split into their three main development lines: the meat-flavouring theropods, later called the Tyronasaurus reg, the Velocioraptor and also the birds, known as the "longhelse" and their relatives, and the plants-flavouring Ornithicchia (bird-flavouring saurier), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is an original theropode.
He shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
In the shadow of Tawa Hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of airbags, as well as the descendants of the Theropodes, the birds.
Thanks to the airbag, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
In Tawa hallae the bones of the vertebral column were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive Theropode with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge sauropods later also had airbags and lightweight bones, it is likely that the common predecessor of the two groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers follow that the witches appeared there for the first time.
Then, the three development lines were separated early and spread from South America across all parts of the globe, which were then still a single mass of land as a supercontinent of Pangäa.
The fact is that the team together with Tawa brought the rest of the two others, not particularly close related theropods.
The three cannot be derived from a common immigration precedent, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the Science study.
There are also objections freely.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonner Paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be distorted because in South America there are very many primitive Dino fossils left, while there is little to find on other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop themselves from a relatively rare line of the Reptilian strain to the dominant agricultural vertebrates of the Earth’s Middle Ages, it is still a challenge.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and the flying saucers, and with many other axes.
Towards the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread throughout the world and developed many new species, while the relationship at the border of the Trias to Jura died.
A History of Success Not Forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There might have been a mass death that the dinosaurs had happened to survive, but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the competition out of the field.
In any case, the story of success did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact was caused by a group of animals to bloom, which had also developed in the Trias, and since then, a shadowed daisies tempted: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors of University Toronto are based on the University of Cambridge, the Uni Wien or Berkeley in California.
Professors from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police space of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe-University hits waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers of Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarity with the Protestant students at Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they 'disregarded' the police use imposed by the Bureau.
President Werner Müller-Estler had the buildings occupied by students and teachers in the education race spread over the past week because walls and works of art had been damaged.
Five students were injured.
The damages, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organized educational events of students and teachers by a police icono commando".
The space represents an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism is "delegation and criminalization of the protest" and is derived from the contents.
The Bureau withdrew the necessary discourse.
The teachers are calling for the immediate imposition of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the owners did not support the injury, that is.
Protest legitimized
The young people of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union union bond also work together with the students.
The protest is a more legitimate expression of growing concern about its own future, says Verdi-Country Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the President and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding for the protest, but no understanding for vandalism, so the CDU-Landag-Agent Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition factions saw this as SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the front to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of sharing the arguments and demands of the students, there was room for room.
The Left has tabled an application asking the Minister of the Interior to report on the police use.
New Silicon Valley
For many years she was considered a secret city, unavailable to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded place in the Soviet Union for secret weapons research.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered a "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograds have been in contact with the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - with the universities and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now, Selenograd and Riedberg in Frankfurt signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation".
The Moscow Vice-Citizen Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planning director Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural science research centre will travel to Selenagrad for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Firms of the FIZ are allowed to take foot on the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian science firms want to make orders in Germany.
Selenagrad is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the major Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for the Rüstungs Research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grünstadt") received his name from the forested hillland where the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be put on high enough.
For the sponsors of the project, it is easy and simple to "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the interior of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will crush the city of the Baden-Württemberg capital for a decade in a hellless construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headrails with rails that end in the middle of the city were then regarded as transport fossils of the 19th century, which acted as brake blocks of modern rail traffic, since it once took a huge amount of time to push locomotives from the back to the front.
Get in, keep up, keep going - so let's go.
The main railway stations should therefore disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a train station, which is about half the length of the trans-European rail highway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, is therefore the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being tackled, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is almost non-payable in the Hessian and Bavarian capital to implement the threshold.
However, there has been no problem of entry and exit since there are modern traffic trains with motor vehicles and motor vehicles at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE-Newstreet to Ulm is now being launched.
National and municipal politicians have put it through.
The railway also carries the risks of the largest infrastructure single project of the Republic of Taxpayers and not of the State Group.
The project can be justified in some ways.
There is a new city space, which - if you think you have the computer-generated graphics of the planner - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The train station and the road construction are designed for passenger transport, which - typically 80 years old - has been attributed to huge growth.
At the time, there was not yet the competition of the airliners.
However, modern transport policy must first be aimed at strengthening freight transport, as transport on the rail is much more environmentally friendly than on the road by truck.
However, because of strong increases, the new track does not run for goods.
It is even more serious that S21 indirectly also targets many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros are to be announced in Switzerland.
That's the official number.
Experts hold ten to 15 billion for realistic.
In the next decade, money will be missing at other nodes and angles in the network.
A total of sixty larger projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the well 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 it has been built on the track in the weather.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake lock.
The Rheintal route will be the bottleneck for international freight: in the heart of Europe.
The government examines the judgment of the airport
In Wiesbaden’s day, the government has made it clear whether it will go against the ruling of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) to the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP Coalition has commissioned experts to examine the more than 400-page VGH judgement in legal terms, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had stated in writing on this day that in the case of the construction of the planned Northwest Landebahn in Frankfurt Airport the night flight ban had to be re-regulated.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged by the Government, should not be compatible with the statutory protection of the population against night flying noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is against the judgement in the revision.
The opposition criticised this upheaval and urged the representatives of the government to reject a revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD fractional chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel requested CDU and FDP to return to their promises made prior to the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be considered as a "wordbreak".
It's damn hard if you can keep his word, Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said on the FDP election logo "We keep the word".
Minister Posch pointed back to Schäfer-Gümbel's proposal that the government try to arrive at its night flights with "right-wing and trickery".
A precise legal examination takes time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legal solution, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
As they represent the opposition, the statements of his group on the night flight ban have never been made.
US banks pay back help
The crisis-stricken U.S. Grand Banks are tearing down their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Tarp Bank Savings Fund to a total of 45 billion dollars (up to 30 billion euros).
The Citigroup also plans to repay State aid after a report by the US envoy CNBC.
The institutions want to remove the restrictions that have been agreed upon with the adoption of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of managers' bonds and the setting up of high fees.
The Bank of America had made good 19 billion dollars of fresh money with investors.
The rest of the sum took it out of its own box, which, among other things, was well filled by retail sale.
Bank Chief Kenneth Lewis expressed his appreciation for the American taxpayer's Wednesday night: The money syringes have helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had raised itself to the point of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the Investment Bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to obtain money on the capital market for exemption from its obligations vis-à-vis the State.
As early as Thursday, the US bank could announce a serious increase in its capital of about 20 billion dollars, CNBC reported calling on circles.
A Citigroup speaker did not want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick Select
And then it went faster than it thought.
Almost two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had forced the official chief editor Nikolaus Brender from the office, the sender may present a successor.
Last night the board wanted to vote on the staff.
As a favourite Peter Frey, head of the ZDF Capital Studio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the sender of this - officially in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, they should also have played a role in preventing the ZDF's complainant from further harming Marcus Schäcker, nor should this proposal be implemented by the Board of Directors.
Frey, shadow candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the body.
The result of the vote has not yet been established at the conclusion of this edition.
Two weeks ago, the Board of Directors had failed with its proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a herb defeat for depositors, an expected one, however.
Because the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election, Brender did not want to confirm in the office.
The opposition was organised against the chief editor of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument, under Brender, that the ZDF's messages had been lost to key rates, he refused another term of office of the senior chief editor.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was exposed.
In the last few years, even 35 state-laws had joined the debate, which considered the progress of the Cooks to be a constitutional contradiction.
It's useless.
To Person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, teaching and Romanism.
After that, he worked for the Southwest radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to the "Today-Journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988-1990 Personal Rapporteur of the Chief Editor; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; until 1998 Director and Moderator of the "Morgenmagazine"; until 2001 Head of the ZDF Foreign Policy; since then Head of the ZDF Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the selection of Brenders, which was elected by the media magazine industry on Wednesday, to the journalist of the year.
Kochs reparted to the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Pfälze Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the countries should amend the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the applicant's personal proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected successor, Peter Frey, had recommended to the Board of Directors a clever chess game - by criticizing the board immediately after the Brender elections.
Thanks to this record of journalistic independence, both depositors were able to nominate him without loss of face for the posts of the chief editor, as well as the Governing Council, without being suspected of holding a party to the office.
In the party logic, Frey is counting on the left liberals.
Study is excluded
Part success for the students: After one year of the education course, the Minister of Culture of the Countries finally launched on Thursday: At a meeting of Ministers of Culture and Higher Education, both sides agreed to improve the conditions of study at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
They agreed to reduce the test loads in the individual: basically, each study module should only be completed with a single test.
In addition, the student's workload should be reviewed and "a realistic and demonstrable measure" ensured.
In addition, policies and universities want to facilitate the recognition of testing services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for bachelor and master studies more flexible.
There should be no different country rules.
Less Tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Ministers of Culture and Union Rectors have carried the flying word from the better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was filled with a specific content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Board decided to reduce the number of tests in part: "Every module usually concludes with only one test", it says in a 30-page paper that should partially re-regulate the authorisation of studies.
With the "significant reduction of the test load", the Accreditation Board president Reinhold Grimm explained, "the content of social development is to be offered which significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, the "Studyability" will be "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content are "strongly to check" whether "necessary student inputs in the selection of the
Events would be avoided.
The students had "a claim to receive playrooms that enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules should apply to the authorisation of new but also to the review of existing studies.
These must be "re-credited" every five years – however, which means it will take until all studies have been reviewed by 2015.
This includes ten accreditation agencies in charge of the accreditation board established by the countries.
The Ministers of Culture had called on the countries in October "with pressure" to influence the agencies so that the fillings were not too large and the inspection regime was not too strict.
In each country, universities and universities with national ministries have already agreed on appropriate measures.
As a single country, Rheinland-Pfalz said additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, the universities are intended to set up teaching programmes and to strengthen study advice as well as testing and abroad.
Countries and universities want to spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a novelty of the Higher Education Act into Parliament.
After this, only one test is required for the completion of a study model.
The study design will be more flexible and will ensure the recognition of performance lessons at other universities and facilitate access to the master.
By the end of the year, all studies in the country will be reviewed on their feasibility.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had again disputed the conditions of study in the country.
In addition to Lob, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of Juso High Schools asked that the formation of education policy should in future no longer be carried out at the "closed doors" of the ministers and college directors.
At the latest, after the education courses, students should now also "present a word" as concerned.
The future academics received support from the President of the High School Directors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Culture Ministers, with which the HRK is working on a joint reform paper.
The Society of Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough: it calls for a legal requirement that allows each graduate with a bachelor's degree to have access to a further master's degree.
On the other hand, countries have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there will be sufficient master studies with the best possible study conditions tomorrow, according to GEW member Andreas Keller.
The countries must clearly set up more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their free access to the Master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Going into Germany and out is almost uncontrollable..." says the initial line of a poem by Lyriker Werner Söllner, in which this in disrupting language groups thematicizes the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom, but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in Romania in 1951, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's bookstore before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetic lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
During a meeting in Munich last Tuesday, he took care of a significant extra-literary lookout, where it was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror mirror of its security features".
Apparently, Söllner left a statement in which he received his cooperation as IM for the Romanian Secret Service Security, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner had received the German language price in 1989.
The application trials had begun in a similar way, first in 1971.
I'm, I closed Söllner, "so someone who hasn't given up on security attempts."
Lyriker Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary conflict with the dictatorial regime mechanisms, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors from Romania are being shielded by a case that makes the ground and the demise of a political system that is based on surveillance and speculation.
Werner Söllner is, as far as you can say after the previous level of knowledge, not only the perpetrators, but also the victims.
In his security act, IM Walter played a role, said after the speech of Söllner of literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
In all of his difficult points at the time, he "produced" him, as Markel.
It was a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement, however, was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, completely surprising, is not the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Germany was a welcoming reservation for security hospital, Herta Müller had already written in July after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The affected may be suspected, speculated, and, in some cases, may have known which name is clear behind the cover name Sorin, Voic and also Walter burrag.
In contrast to the very procedural look of the Stasi Acts in this country, it is still very common to deal with the backlogs of security surveillance.
A systematic clarification has been delayed and impeded in recent years.
One of the Birthler authorities of the National Council for the Development of the Security Acts (CNSAS) was established in 1999, but the issue of the Acts has been rather daring since.
Since 2005, there has been a law governing the management of the files.
The fact that the influence of former security members in Romania is still very large, following the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview in which a former security chief from Temesvar expressed himself dissatisfaction with the prizer.
You've got a psychosis, you've only heard it once.
The infamilies of power here felt quite inconceivable in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, in the case of Söllner, as often in the context of debt, there are inevitable questions.
Why just now? Who has been damaged? The resulting reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession can be hoped that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by knowledge rather than by education and shame.
To the genius of the work of Herta Müller, who took the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if a neatly dressed external servant came from a very nice Christmas party on which a sports article manufacturer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross went up a quarter hour after midnight in the accompanied by an orange plastic unit of the equipment in a c-class.
The man with the marked glazing was able to drive for the rest of his city.
Otherwise he could have run himself - alcohol was not in the game, and the 55-year-old was as little busy as he was.
It was a pleasant evening, but in the morning the work goes on.
Or just let it go.
In the words of the first three days of the obligation of Switzerland: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the success of 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: It will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "very important task" was before Sunday.
Then it is applicable in Mainz to repeat the King's class performance in the League everyday.
And to remove the completely re-discovered weaknesses after the fast three gates through Marica (5), Trêsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Resolution
The eighth final of the Champions League (Hinspiel 16/17. + 23/24 February/ Backtrace 9./10. + 16/17 March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the full-fledged team of the Babbel successor remained.
Not only in the alleged health brilliance, which had served the uncertain Stuttgart profession in the short term self-reliance, readiness to use and joy of play.
I went to the players and told them that they should look to their strengths, and they stopped to be more courageous, the soul klepppner Gross explained the so simple sounding success recipe that under Therapeut Babbel had no effect anymore.
He invented a certain magic, told Babbel-advisor Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes at the football, sometimes things happen that would not have been possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week's break of injuries due to his dynamics as well as the best player on the spot, tried to describe the identified "phenomenas" with the word "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new leader: "He is a man who requires discipline and discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
Under Babel, it was apparently lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, sports chief Horst Heldt warns
But the VfB Stuttgart needs a constant.
Like Gross, players and managers were also afraid to overestimate the victory against a weak and completely overpowered resistance of Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil wake, Khedira gave thought.
And sports chief Horst Heltt said that although a season goal was reached, the other one was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That hero on his 40th birthday, even after his first home victory, was not likely to celebrate for three months, was at the events of the weekend, which were fresh in the form of a television interview by Torhüter Jens Lehmann, which was released immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that the others make, not the Jens, counted the harsh criticism of Lehmanns.
He had proposed to the board a lack of leadership and had decided to change training on the pressure of puberty fans.
Even that his free day was cut off after games, Lehmann valued as a sign of lack of sovereignty and mistrust.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure egoism", called Heldt back and announced consequences for the final man.
You're probably not gonna be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
However, they agreed with all the others that without the preparation of the completed training team, the playful and combative presentation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and also the man with the plastics.
WM-Fight in Weight
Today's duel in Bern: The challenge of Kevin Johnson Worldmester Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures has been repeated.
After twelve hard rounds, however, the Ukrainian defended its heavyweight title after the WBC version.
The judgment of the Court of Justice fell unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains a Box World champion in the weight.
The 38-year-old WBC team won the U.S. Kevin Johnson single-handedly on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
In the past, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't fit with the K.o. that everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance on 39 wins in 41 professional battles, twice he had to fight because of injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Berner Arena, the 2,02 metres of Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
The 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, however, repeatedly withdrew to the battles of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not reach his dangerous rights decisively.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only to come over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows hit the world champion only rarely.
After all, he was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who had gone with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had provided in front of the battle in the capital of Switzerland for some vertebrates.
He attacked Klitschko as a "hostic zombie", who can't do anything right.
On Wednesday, the champion was allowed to provoke on Friday to wipe the sunglasses from the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory for Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also won his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of time, he had struck Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his WBC belt, which he had to give up before.
This year, he won the title of Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Areola from the United States in September.
I just got a hit in this fight and I'm physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the fast return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
But the belt of the WBA is worn by British David Haye after it was able to remove the 2,13 metres of Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had given up a fight against Vitali Klitschko in the summer.
It is estimated that its promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the London Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin has referred to Defence Minister Guttenberg as a liar because of false information about Kunduz affair.
SPD and left require clarification from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - After the recent findings of Kunduz's air attack, the opposition Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has submitted a conscious deception.
The minister has said "scientificly the falsehood" on the deadly bombing of two tanks from September, Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD message "day show".
It's called land-run: he lied.
The murder order was issued in disregard of the rules of the International Defence Group for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had read, Mr Guttenberg said, Trittin.
On Friday it was known that in the attack it was not only to destroy the removed cargo, but also to target two Taliban leaders.
U.S. air raid requested by the German Kunduz Commander Colonel Klein was reported to have killed or injured up to 142 people.
Greens, SPDs and left asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Federal Day and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to explain whether a targeted death strategy is part of the Afghanistan policy of the federal government - and whether Chancellor, Federal Defence and News Service approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green-College Renat Kunast requested.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm decided to withdraw the criticism.
The Office did not have an influence on specific initiatives of the Federal Defence in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, the Ministry's presentation of the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert also raised doubts.
According to SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and fully informed about the background of the tanker attack.
Officially, they would have claimed the existence of the Nato reports and would have provided the Minister with sensitive details.
However, the two top officials indicated that they had even pointed to several reports from the Ministry of Defence, including a separate document from the commander-in-command, and a campaign report.
Wichert is currently seeking clarification in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper".
He has not received an answer so far, that is.
The Ministry did not comment on the proposals on Saturday, and pointed out that this would be explained in the Federal Survey Committee, which wants to be established on Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental illness and drug abuse, the boundaries between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens in bed, everything's fine.
If we are in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can always give up the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions in the growing world see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered as crazy or drug-sensitive in the modern Western world, at least as special.
However, such images and voices do not only arise in mental illness or drug abuse.
We owe our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint images or write novels, ensure that the boundaries between dream, madness and reality are shifting.
Traumaticly altered awareness conditions can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case of madness.
Even if triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mysticist Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age Prophesy Carlos Castaneda, shamanic state of expression, psychosis and hallucinations can be attributed to similar processes.
Halluzinations or vain assumptions arise when the balance of the neuronal bone elements of the brain - all in front of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is dissolved and the interaction of various parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity no longer has power over it
The context of madness and dream has been occupied by philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle described Halluzinations as a form of the dream in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861 found a "great similarity of the irresinance with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was "a psychosis, with all the inhumanities, delusional formations, mind changes of such a thing".
It is autumn 2001, when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
The gravity has no power over him, he swims on the roof of the room.
He's feeling a little bit.
Behind him, winged devils with bluered, distorted frescoes, teething.
They hunt him, hit him with heavy, flaming sticks, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Sounds, malicious voices draw from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. rides two cables from the stereo plant, taps it into a loop and fastens it on a hook on the roof.
He goes up to a loudspeaker and puts the snake around his neck.
Jump.
The snake's gonna get rid of it.
That's supposed to be a lesson for you, the voices in the drummer-fighting choir, "Go to the clinic and be healed!"
Today Henning T. 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years are back, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is called schizophrenic-paranoia psychosis, and he is manic-depressive, he takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The Tragic Images Are Grievous Reality
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in the life of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, affected people may no longer be able to distinguish between the inner and outer world, becoming an exaggerated condition that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Especially common is the voice - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Even optical hallucinations are not rare.
The affected person is not able to separate importants from minors, the brain can no longer filter disruptive signals, the consciousness is overwhelmed by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the locks for a flow of ideas and fantasies, the deeper layers of consciousness emerge.
The reality perception in psychosis is subject-centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, the clinic supervisor for General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Clinic.
The schizophrene is located in the center of the event, everything has a meaning towards it.
At the same time, he plays a passive role, he becomes, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenia therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality comparison is usually not possible for them, the traffic images are cruel reality, excluding awakening.
Once in life to experience a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the mental and spatial structure of the reality that is perceived in the psychosis remains in principle."
The crazy thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, and the expansion of experience is taking place in the real framework.
Why our brain beats caprioles, researchers still face puzzles.
Exceptional conditions can lead to a short-term loss of reality in every person, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems to be a genetic association for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determinant factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in the case of the affected.
We assume that the neuronal respiration of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, due to a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, for example, explains Fuchs.
But there remains a puzzle as to how the disorder of the neuronal system is going to occur, which, at first, does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis if the mood is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they enter the transmitter system.
If our brain runs hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get what, says Lübecker Psychology Professor Erich Kasten.
Whether you feel comfortable or uncomfortable is often just a question of the point of view.
Boxes have been collecting reports of hallucinations and trade appearances for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are part of the typical symptoms of psychosis, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and shoulder brain trauma are often included.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain itself is a healthy person.
Hallucinations, so casts, consist of memory content, which are usually retained.
They are created when the brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too low; when our brain runs hot or even if stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also travel, stress, love or other mental state exceptions.
In recent studies, up to one third of respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visiting the gymnasium there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If it wasn't for the pictures and voices.
In the pause it may occur that a successful young man with long, dark hairs will address it.
When he answers, the fellow students look at it with surprise - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They keep the frightened girl for a relaxed day dream, but Sarah K. doesn't dream that she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees these boys, just like she hears and sees the girl in the bank.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
I'm crazy? Sometimes she asks.
But she knows that this boy and the others are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are most frightening
Often the trog images are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just introduces a new associate, while he explains mathematical equations to all the others, hearing and seeing at the table.
At night, the appearances are mostly frightening.
When she waits in her dark room on the bed, which comes too late and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the frescoes or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell them anything that would make them crazy.
autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She's been living with her friend since last year.
A year ago, the halls stopped.
Since she's been in contact with the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Wahn is also an art work of despair
If a person is socially isolated or suffers from travel, he has very likely after a while of hallucinations, says Kasten.
I guess the brain is under-work and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, she often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned with 13 that the man she calls Papa since she can think is not her natural father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that process actual impressions and sounds, it is difficult to distinguish between images and reality, such as Sarah K., "Every experience", says Kasten, "is in the brain, the reality is formed there.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain to arise, so they seem so real."
Also nightly dream images are valued as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia, mental health is able to recognize their trade images as false.
Castes therefore advises its patients to value the hallucinations as a special ability.
Limit state between dream and hallucination
In our highly conscious world, imaginary experiences are unfortunately pathology, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creative – Wahn is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneroid experience form, a particular form of the traumatically altered awareness.
Oneuroides are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experienced person holds for real and that he can't even distinguish himself from the state of growth in the future.
The oneuroid consciousness condition occurs in trauma or disease-related extreme conditions, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor failure at full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening reality situation by a world of his own, imaginary that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of limit state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is faced in the imagination.
An intense form of sensationalism and sensationalism in a situation that makes it impossible for us to suffer from a loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zürcher art historian Peter Cornelius Clausen also describes his oneuroid experiences in his book "Hertzchange" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness comes on trips after a heart attack operation with subsequent heart transplantation, while his body is condemned on the ICU for motionlessness.
Clauses dive into a self-created world, visit foreign times and places: He experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot waits for his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under Adiges, who produce the waste of blood.
If a Greek on the motorcycle is dragged into his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean Mafioso.
It goes completely on in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal journeys differ fundamentally from each dream to clauses.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories from mental travels are clear to me even after years and in additional details.
Even more clear and intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other life experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneroids, psychosis, Hallucinations and drug smoke show how fragile our internal images of external reality are also in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarized by the psychologist caste, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can be quite rich as well.

Burda
Children to take over the publication at 27 years of age
The new editor-in-chief Callen is an interim solution: long-term Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding should also be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children are 27 years old and are determined to join the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We have carefully arranged the details for this.
The question of whether they are active in the company first arises.
The question is, are they able to do so?
It is not possible to introduce 7500 employees to their children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This affects the children and the company too.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the Chairmanship of the Board, and Paul-Bernhard Callen appointed his successor.
The 52-year-old call has been a member of the board since 1999 at Burda.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, the responsibility for the company's assets came to bear on and after the expulsion of Jürgen Mordenhofer also the responsibility for direct marketing, foreign trade, printing and finance.
For the first time, therefore, there is no family member at the top of the publishing house.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The name of Callen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years," says Burda.
The holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
With a view to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family companies are not safe before the decline: "This always involved families who were stuck in a search for capital that had completely speculated and thought they could rise to a very large player.
My strategy was never.
He had "no world power dreams", so Burda.
I do not see myself as the political president of this country as it was Springer, and I do not want to play with 'Time' in the world league, these stores have become too large.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
This is at least what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything revolves only around body care.
In the area of wellness, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find among other companies such as Hedonai, which provide for a relaxation with lasers; Spaxion, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdresser Luis & Taci, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with its natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that represents more than 130 different teasports through its teahouse.
A relaxing massage together with your partner and at the same time having a fantastic view of the capital, or for two hours renting the relaxation area to put your own beauty party with eight friends on the legs and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the many possibilities that Spaxion offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments and for hydro therapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The fitness studio also has this type of device, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the customer's training units and thus provide them with a complete personal training.
You start a training unit with the entry of a personal password on a touch screen that is against the devices.
Then show you various videos how to perform your training units correctly.
The head of the fitness studio ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and dehydration) are fully sufficient to train the body muscles.
If after you have trained your body, even at hairdressers' lounge, Luis & Taci has a room in which treatments for the recovery of hair speech, shine and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. 365 days a year.
The Various Decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and so it is a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and get their solid clothing in our wardrobe.
The shape of the decolletés, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an overcrowded and very complicated decolleté. Only one can embrace it.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the "LIVE Office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (logistics for the introduction of the electroautos) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electroautos in the city and enter into agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is to be developed to promote the electric car and to include opinions and actions in the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and in particular to their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative that Endesa participates in in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a whole range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT.
Zapatero sees "one horizon of peace" for the car sector
The Government President, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the Spanish automotive industry's prophecy, which is the country's grave exporter, "a horizon of peace".
In the presentation of the Economic Report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again reminded the Government of the efforts made to support the automotive sector during the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, today we would have a panorama of the abandonment and the closure of some of our main production works," said the president.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a peaceful horizon for the future of this industry, which is our growing export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided EUR 800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided more than EUR 3 billion for investments.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also stressed the Government's commitment to adjudicating the demand, in response to the 2000E Plan, which will be implemented in cooperation with the autonomous communities and car manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows the exhaust gas of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by 6 % on average, leading to a "strong increase" in the permits, which increased by 40 per cent in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Classic Car Fair is held, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of motors.
This exhibition will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in Pabellón de Cristal der Casa de Campo in Madrid.
On an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will present their brands.
You can not only admire classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all only earthly articles related to the world of motors at ClassicAuto Madrid.
In this way you can find accessories, spare parts, components, materials accessories, accessories, publications, miniatura cars, etc. at the exhibition.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classical motors that the collectors and lovers will enjoy.
Among the companies participating in this fair are classics de Mos and Good Old Times, vehicle sales; Juan Lumbreras, restaurants; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of cars, specialized on Mercedes Benz.
Efficacy testing in the Auven area
In addition, the sales activities at this fair are complemented by parallel events: meetings, sports exhibitions, skill tests, events and competition.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a self-established race track in the Auven area of the fairground.
Mazda3 i-stop: Environmentally adaptable sport
Mazda wants to prove that sport is fully compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the engine's automatic stop and drive system, baptized on the name i-stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of Mazda 3 stands out through its good notes in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behaviour, the mechanic, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front seats you can find that the front seats provide an excellent ergonomic and good hold.
In addition, the game of the race is excellent.
For further consideration of the unit consisting of the instrument table and the armature board, it can be found that Mazda is in a futuristic interior with a variety of buttons and switches in the visible colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend.
This style reminds us of the style of the Honda Civics.
This is why it can be said that both the Mazda 3, as well as the Civic, both Japanese models, turn away from the subtlety of the German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to overcome.
The travel space of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than the appropriate comfort so that four adults can drive too comfortable with the car.
All of this comes with a thicker and well-shaped boxing room.
The stop and approach system is now only available for the 2 litre petrol engine with 150 PS and a 6-pass switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out by its fineness, by its quiet noise, by its services and by its low consumption.
And all those who do not travel many kilometres a year should consider this i-stop with a petrol engine because of its gross comfort in switching and its low consumption, even if at Mazda the diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model is a specialty selected for the sample hat, as it has a significantly larger number of items from the series equipment.
The series equipment is primarily designed by the driver for the exchange of traffic (RVM), which will eliminate the dead angle, but also the operation elements for the traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive internal level, the board computer with a rough screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth, and the chromed 17-inch flags.
After all, this version also includes, as if it were not enough for equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the capable Bixenon rails and the sound system BOSE with CD chargers.
Error
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not have many kilometres a year can also buy the i-stop version that is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
The only negative on this model is, however, a slightly higher price, between EUR 21.770 for the Luxury model and EUR 2.3.70 for the experienced Sportive model.
However, in contrast to this high price, Mazda3 offers us the new highest driving pass every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensitivity for Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars shined, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, decided for a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is too limited to be able to read only his e-mails without having an opportunity to see certain attachments or surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
To see it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea of itself is above all for young people of interest.
In contrast to the smartphones, Peek only costs very little and has a very generous flatrate, for example only half the price of the flatrate of an iPhone.
After having seen the success of this, the company has placed two new devices on the market: one, which is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free data service, in contrast to the Peek, where you have to pay a six-fold higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and therefore its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, however, has prepared a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, approximately 12 euros per month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to refuse all the data in order to read their emails as soon as you have crossed the border or if you are looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with a phone).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly misleading and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but after my experience you need a doctoral title in physics and a good glasses to read all the small prints.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission about affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside of your own country you are always afraid to read your emails and that with right.
That a small device like FonPeek (but it is always surprising that it has the name Fon, although it does not have Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariffs, means that the phone providers are slow but sure to think about and start considering various possibilities as to how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, in its prices it includes downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
No fights and no hooks.
This is an Internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, that is, when you buy it, not a month for a month.
And that's exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a shopping option with long-term Internet access as it already offers the Peek in the USA.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails on the phone, thank you.
Except I expect this because I think it would be a more suitable model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Festive Color of Michelle
Yellow is no doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
At the entry of Barack Obama as president of the United States, they appeared in a dress and suit of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him at his, no doubt, the second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models on both occasions: over the fact that it was almost the same color - a glowing yellow -, there was the clothing made of three parts - clothing, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and to this she brought something grove-shaped or a necklace.
Even so, at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress at more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes differ greatly in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the opening of the office, she wore a garment from the top and in Oslo a patterned Samt.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with semi-trailers and for the second time a similar model, but gold colors.
The hair was also different every time: the hair was high on this occasion as a hair cover, the previous one was wearing the hair open.
75% of the working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want children.
To this end, CSIC's study in collaboration with the Institute for Women "Fruitability and Career of Women in Spain" is carried out in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt as to whether 75% of the women employed see their career opportunities on the labour market as a result of their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are huge differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not, and if so, what kind of profession they practice.
Those of them who do no other work outside the house, work only half a day or have no fixed employment contract will become mothers and have more children.
On the contrary, women move with a stable position, especially in the public sector, the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed job get their first child on average only 3.7 years after being married, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment who have used longer to achieve this and who have been married and the first child has only achieved much later.
In addition, the nature of work has a serious impact on the motherhood, even less than the calendar regarding the reception preparation," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account in the age of women in the household and the first child.
According to survey, the age is much higher at the time of the hierate and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be found in the women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group were between 35 and 49 years old, depending on whether they had only the primary school or higher education, on average with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
Moreover, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with the main conclusion are already married before their first fixed position and have their first child, it makes the women with a middle or high school leave exactly different and they are only looking for a fixed position and marry and then get their first child, Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising "Because you are worth it".
The leading performer from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actors at international level, will thus become another famous hanger as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before you were the last to join this exclusive club, the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
For men, the cosmetic company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Sport College of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award of the UK fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today, met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
For this reason they all appeared.
The Ex-Model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen as the best model this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, images of Fernando Vicente) the three-way X-ray images of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fearsome genre (korzbiography, life and work), but is looking for a similarity to the glowing piece of heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vincent neither saves fear nor enlightenment.
Over the fact that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving call to read and read again and again.
Here are some sections from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost mental drive, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the unholy fate, the moral without guilt and the innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christ, he wrote about what he did not in his mind in blood, had, between power and ignorance, with an overwhelming poetic humour, without any sense, like the witches who almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was brought up by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirty years, to dermave in her band, in which the emotions of the marriage united with the joy of reue, a spiritual privilege that existed to come into heaven on the road of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was issued in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 peaks in the world literature, one has to climb up on the north wall, on the wall, where the best climbers are always trying to get back to the top."
About William Faulkner: "It was a comical causation.
He sometimes said about himself that he would be the heir of a good owner of the county and once again he said that he would be the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams came from a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the crazy cry, which was pulled out of a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo would go down to the night of the 20th century in a literary way. He made this on a journey on which he fled before himself and with a speech full of violence against the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power to finally stop writing a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are enthralled: ' Sleep after the effort,/ after the wind of the port,/ rest after the war,/ after a dull life you will find chance at death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depressions.
The husband took it completely normal when she told him that Eduard VII was spying on her between the Azales or singing the birds in Greek.
It is not the only other case known where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotician whose literary talent was still much bigger than her folly."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do otherwise than try to drown Joyce in Baroja?
What would be the intention of Benet if Baroja did not lead to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, besides the name of that man, to destroy him so that he could put himself on this base?"
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother spent the last week walking through our town in Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 survived by her and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we got out of the zoo and weighs about six kilos, and then out of the heat they missed him two steps and seriously injured him.
Our equipment cannot even be contained in words, as it is incomprehensible to us, because the spass should be carried out on the line in the face of a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal.
To this end, the harassment that a woman who went to a pleasant walk came to get when she wanted to justify these people because of the incident, she even feared her own life, for if such a foolish person attacks a dog, he may also become the same with a woman, a child, an older lord, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place in a normally quiet city district at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very usual Tuesday.
The dog has been shining all day long.
Of course, we have made a show in a nearby police station, but we still have great doubts as to whether this will bring about anything at all and in order to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the clever criminals were Spaniards.
Our equipment about the event has prompted us to show this event.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmet
In cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Transport Safety (Fesvial), the tire manufacturer Michelin has launched a campaign to promote helm use, especially in the case of younger motorcyclists, as both companies have announced today.
This initiative aims to pay attention to the importance of helm use, as it is ultimately the only protection element that can prevent head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign represents part of its commitment to road safety, which "is far more comprehensive than the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more secure with each day" and further confirmed that it also contributes to bringing this goal a step closer each day with other actions of pedagogical and informative character.
This new campaign to promote helm use on the motorcycle running under the slogan 'To be or not to be' will be distributed in a first phase poster to over 500 motorcycle stations to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that traffic safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because it is always committed to one of its main objectives to the development of ever safer products as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles.
The sale of small trucks is increasing again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally starts to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles approved in November in Spain represent an increase of 12,6 % in relation to 2008 and, what is even more important, they are thus the first growth at a steady decline after 22 consecutive months, according to the figures presented by the Afac manufacturer association and the Ganvam car dealer association.
However, these good figures are currently only to be used with great caution, as the reference data for the comparison of November 2008 were a particularly bad year with a fall of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total authorisations of these 11 months remain 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all of the vehicles from which the retail transport market consists include: car trailers of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small delivery cars and lighter trucks/cars.
Furthermore, the same weather clouds are still in the sky, which attract the demand most in compassion, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private persons, the bulk of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100 % of all cases, are engaged in the purchase with third-party financing.
These restrictions, which are the consequences of the reverse monetary union of credit institutions, must include further factors such as the increase in unemployment rates or the decline in the poor economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a plan 2000E vehicle has not helped.
However, this plan is not only intended for individuals, but also for self-employed and small companies have a right to buy if they want to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 output, which may not exceed 160 grams per running kilometres, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam recalled that it was absolutely necessary for the State to pay particular attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The Association of Auto Traders Prophesy for 2010 is a year similar to the one for which it accounts for 19 % of a sale (in the case of passenger cars and parking cars).
Support for Bremsovern in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the ABS anti-blocker braking system and as it is now happening with the stability control ESP, the emergency braking aid systems must become an obligation in the European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly authorised passenger cars and small passenger transporters, a period of validity was set for the remaining vehicles by the end of February 2011.
The European Union's commitment to improving the protection of pedestrians, however, can also help these braking systems to prevent many accidents because of their way of working.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake overload, which is recognised by the system by the brake force carried out by the driver on the brake pedal.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to a survey commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers who were involved in an accident did not even get on to the brake pedal and half of them did not lose full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the other hand, the brake aid enters the brake system with maximum force and thereby reduces the brake time and therefore also the brake distance which a car is leaving at the brake procedure.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents could be prevented every year when pedestrians are damaged if all cars with this type of emergency brake assistants were fitted.
There would be even less accidents - one estimates that any fourth accident could be prevented with personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (over radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, the system will help him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the compound is already inevitable, the brake assistant shall apply the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors shifts the plan for Opel until January
While the team of the Opel-Work in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first April week, probably on 8th, says Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer indicates that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the site concerned already has its consent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, the final document, which will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be moved by the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that a decision will be made in the next few days regarding the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on American autobuilders to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM provides to be in touch with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the skyper sports car, which has a stronger commitment from the Russian group Converg back-covering.
If no one of these buyers were to come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
In the control of Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewelry, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really made it easier to make it 80 kilos, making it only 1275 kilos on the scale now.
In order to create such a thing, they refused to be the first one on the automatic climbing roof, which was replaced by a tent-line roof with manual drive, saving 21 kilos alone; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, like the GT3 "smoothing" further 15; by the exception of the air-conditioning system, another 13 times; and by reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, another 7 kilos were saved; by the installation of sports baccquet seats once more 12 times and with the light 19-inch traps, five again.
Then again, six kilos of less than six kilos of the audio CDR-30 had been abandoned and the exchange of the door handles by grips from the fabric reached the missing kilo.
Although it is also available with the double-deployed PDK, the sample yard was carried out with a vehicle with 6-passing handrails, mainly on the smaller terrains of California, on mountain tracks that were truly very curvy.
In his driving behaviour, he can only give him the notes without tabulation.
However, the reduction in its weight does not necessarily lead to the fact that he would no longer be so sure on the road.
It is rather the opposite of the case: for a long time we have not tried such a small and lightweight model, which gives a feeling of great safety at the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to make his muscles warm at a low walk in the necessary time, until we give him the orders to race, slow, relax and then get everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything you say to him. The car does everything we show him with our hands on the wheel, thanks to his drive, which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all taste directions
The sound of its V6 boxers with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) has been accomplished and can be increased with the 'sport' option as well as through a system that can change the engine noise, which has already been used for the first time in the Panamara.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginably brutal, regardless of whether it is coming out of the station or re-accelerated.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the ground floor, on which we drove with the boxster Spyder, was already quite damaged, but the car won the battle holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire track; and that, although we found ice in some of these curves in the mornings and roll break in the morning.
In summary, you can say that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as it is otherwise rare and it contains much more than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and costs 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl.
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon cosmetic line and an opportunity star at the fashion show of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck stiffness as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
The Basconia offers itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many successful players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an outstanding triumph with 82-91 at his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electrica and thus comes to the first place within his group after Mirza Teletovic's great performance, which was with eight triples of the best of his team (29 in the evaluation).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the important opportunities of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a great dose of use and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end of their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the Blaurotes, who from the beginning sat at the top of the display table.
Since the first four bodies of the team from Vitoria had already come out of the perimeter, one could already learn that they had come to the field with well-heated gloves.
It was English and Teletovic, who were primarily responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava decided to play an internal game of Barac and the game of Elijahhu, who was received on his return to the team with pipes and applause, which is his home to further expand its advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" evaluation of splitter already claimed that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the obvious advantage in the break, the game was not yet decided for long, and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians once again that not everyone wins in their field, and thanks to the ever-changing "hand of Elijah" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini strongly contributed to the turning of the "golden" (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but everything other than dead, had to prepare a couple of toys with meeting security to get air again and at one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, which with three almost consecutive trifles and with the support of English and Ribas, made sure that the display table again showed a brighter distance of (54-67) that the host could be decorated at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alaves were bloated in the last quarter and already announced by English and San Emeterio (60-75) that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had earned in the first three and a half minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, who did not best their team and tried to give their team power again by three points from the line (70-77).
However, and although splitter was placed out of place because of the fouls, Ivanovic's team did not quit, and the Israelis did not defend themselves well, in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Violations prevented Unicaja from being ordered to strike
Unicaja lost a loud voice in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in Group B of the Euroliga, and that in a game that was marked by the adventures of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the internal game, which made the Greek victory easier.
The Málaga team was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship or of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of Europe's strongest and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their game offered in the first quarter, the Andalusians could begin to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the host was bluffing with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja era, even though the local team with an internal game between Burousis, Vujcic and Shortsanitis made it the display table in the 13th minute 22-20 for its benefits, the minutes in which it would have almost gone to the battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams, and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to be finally warm and its superiority over both the games, while leaving England Joel Freeland because of an injury and the three mistakes of Carlos Jiménez himself left clear traces at Unicaja.
Among her players in the indoor field and the Lithuanian predecessor Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their benefit in the 19 minutes to 44-32.
An uplift was impossible
The third quarter of the game was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite his loss of 19 and even managed to compensate for the difference of 66-48 in the 27 minutes, which led the group into the swing.
Unicaja tried to move away from the many opportunities and the exclusion of the wounded shooter Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja in the 31 minute thanks to the suspension and the triples of Cook and the use of Lewis, there was some hope again at 66-57.
However, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was not to be slowed.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic was able to make the difference up to 81-62 in the 37th minute, and Unicaja had to beat himself and the leadership of Olympiacos had to retreat.
How much should you earn because of your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most of the ads of properties, job offers and cars in Spain, get the amount they should earn because of their profile.
The "How much should you earn?" tool calculates the user's fees on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. The user is provided with a form on Facebook that can enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after one week after the application was first available, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average felt "slightly paid", explains the responsible for the product, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross amount of EUR 45.226 and a French 31/059, as opposed to the EUR 24,000 that a Spanish is worth.
As a result, an Lkw expert has an annual net amount of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid work in Spain is the one that a cellar with 11.592 Euros net annually; followed by the work of a seller with 14.725 Euros and the one who works with 15.667 Euros.
The most sought-after places on the Internet in the last three months are one driver, half-days and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in her message in Tegucigalpa.
The President of the Office shall leave the diplomatic representation at the latest on 27 January 2010 when his mandate is officially expired.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" had to leave before that date the message he had found since 21 September asylum.
"He is aware that he has to go on January 27th, as his mandate runs on this day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The envoy also quoted the former presidents, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the appointed date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the return of the government of Brazil," Zelaya explained on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (with which Porfirio Lobo was the winner), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian message until January.
However, he tried to take refuge in Brazil this week.
However, this failed to acknowledge the status of an asylum-seeker politician who wanted to force the "de facto" government under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the darkest days of the last spring, in which the inflation of the assets was the dominant mood on the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is in no way surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions about one of nature from an uncertain future.
The leverage used to stabilise markets was to compare the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to indirectly release liquidity at interest rates that move around zero so as to buy the assets to abate in this way.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as good as finished and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, start to throw something sand into the drive, as the ECB had already done with its annual increase next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox mavages, and we will be witnessing a change in the reduction of risk premiums.
The fluctuations of stock exchanges and the differences in company bonds are increasing again, even if they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States saw themselves forced to make public the private risks and the government's debt is rising again.
We now focus on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, leading to an increase in the differences in the eurozone countries in terms of Germany.
Spain has not yet been affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision below regarding the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not harm to bring the defenders of the moral risk to silence, who again tried to raise awareness with the world economic policy leaders, for what they had caused, as they had lost the devastating effects of limiting loans to the loss of jobs when they had actually taken a new day to thank them.
Nonetheless, what is happening in Dubai is a tribal war between the Egyptians in order to restore the power to the Emirates and the development in Greece has already been foreseen.
A government that rejects the State's guilt, elections and a new government that draws on the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary saves from non-compliance with its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allows a euro-member country to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account when it is necessary to maintain the stability of government funds.
Yes, we find ourselves as expected before an episode of normalisation of the risk premiums, after some discharges up too high, that would now be within the expectations.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in the state debt increase at the same speed as the European corporate bonds.
However, if European differences were to decrease and the Spanish continue to increase, then this would be a special Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is a farce. While the present-day indicators require a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and correct their 2011 scenario up to the top, including the OECD and the European Commission, which again comes with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all these warnings do not promise a long life.
Again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although it is said in the moment "preview when driving".
Associated branches
The President of Iberdola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, appeared as the first yesterday before Parliament's sub-committee, where the strategy on Spain's energy supply will be discussed in the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán of the press gave some points about what he had delegated to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the President of Iberdola, Spain has to invest 50 billion Euro and another 60 billion from that date to 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60 billion, but would amount to 95 billion.
However, Iberdola believes that it should not be invested in an increase in energy production capacity but in distribution networks and international associations.
From 2020, the question will change and the performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, it is expected that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the priority of other "supporting energy".
Galán, who believes that the draft legislation for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has called for, did not in any case want to say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his view, "the long-term approach is clearly set in this direction, in spite of some "one" assumptions, as described by the President of Iberdola.
As it is, Galán believes that decisions on investments should be made now, even if they are long-term, since it will take some time and a stable compensation framework is needed to tackle them.
Ferrovial receives the "handling" from Aer Lingus on ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, the Swiss sport, is the preferred partner of the Irish Aer Lingus Flux for the luggage service at ten European airports on which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The Agreement, to which no figures have been notified so far, shall be signed for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol yesterday to cooperate in creating an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The Union plans investments of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to investigate energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with high depth and building for its first highway construction in Australia
Actiona fights for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market on which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction concerned is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately EUR 1,047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German Supreme are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for actiona to establish itself as a construction company and a railway operator in the country.
The city administration wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration had decided on public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) in order to advance the project according to a business plan set up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and wall management.
In view of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to $1.7 billion in Australia (1,047 billion in euros), with three consortia in the last phase, mainly from European construction companies.
The group named Transcity is listed by Actiona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BDD and Hella.
The first company is one of Australia's growing construction companies, while the second one is located in Italy, one of the best specialists for underground construction.
Against the team of Actiona, the consortium of Northern Direct, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructure and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the closest choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Lightton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtift, which in turn belongs to ACS), also owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger, and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises powerful construction work and privatizations, however, has a reputation that it applies to overcome, as it is only through the purchase of a domestic construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies referred to above or by car fingers, in addition to Asian references, and which must be pursued by the Spanish builders only.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its participation of 30% to the highest level, owner of the so-called Lightton.
Active millions
Actiona is of utmost importance to the sector in this geographical area, where it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its growing windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies that were commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His aim is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The underground road, supported by the Brisbane Infrastructure Office and elevated Northern Link (Northern Zübringer), aims to connect the western motorway in Toowong with the surrounding Stravae in Kelvin Grove (see map) over a distance of 5 kilometres through the tunnel. This is the purpose of the massive waveway to drive the roads of Brisbane.
The roadmap issued by the city administration is the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this road is to be opened for transport in the last few months of 2014, it is expected that the construction works will take place until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two tracks in each direction, an electronic mating system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland participates in financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For high depth, Brisbane is already a big deal.
Australia gives priority to a contract with the government of 154 million signed yesterday, and it is still a major contract.
The ACS subsidiary will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with glass fibre cable by means of its home subsidiary Lightton.
This improvement will allow 400,000 people to access the Internet quickly and the German company will work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company received the King George Tower construction project with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction has not yet started and has received 129 million for this purpose.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investments amount to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has taken over its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2,1 kilometres long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of EUR 64,5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after receiving the grant for construction work to expand the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) over 130 million.
Thus, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore gets a piece of Rushmore from Renfe
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years by Mrs. Rushmore over a sum of about three million euros a year, the railway company shared.
This contract also provides for two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies, who presented the competition issued by Renfe, of which 4 came to the end, among them TBWA, who was responsible for the advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be commissioned with the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalties over 63 million for France Télécom because of the distortion of competition.
France Télécom, the regulatory authority for competition in France, has imposed a penalty of more than 63 million euros for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted the competition on fixed network and mobile by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and trust programmes for consumers on the edge of the regulation.
Together with this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state companies have collected more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 due to the lack of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, since the authorities waiting for the competition believe that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and has therefore become reprehensible again.
Trade in application
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company follows the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application page on the Internet to increase revenue from transactions that do not originate from the telephone connection.
In principle, this website is active by Orange in France and the United Kingdom.
Until 2010, we have to wait until this page is available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has introduced Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
The Champions League has since its birth in 1992 developed as a source of income for the Fubball club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since, which brings them the third and fifth place of the football club, which has earned most of the money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
To win the UEFA Champions League, not only brings fame to itself. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the major associations.
According to UEFA, the League has distributed up to EUR 5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) that have participated in this event since its establishment in 1992/93.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The Weive Club is located in third place in Europe, which earned most of the money by its participation and which next to AC Milan is the only one who has won the trophies three times.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is fifth.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also received most money through their participation in the last Champoins League.
And that, although they lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in the third place of the countries that could take money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, unlike four bis Italy, three at England and two at Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated method of allocation of funds used by UEFA.
In this business year, the organization, whose chairman is Michel Platini, is counting on revenue of 1,090 million by the Champions League.
From this money, UEFA 413.1 million is provided for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualification course (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who fought for participation received 3.8 million because of their blue presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they fought.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 Euros) and for an undecided (400,000 per team). Clubs that have arrived at the eighth final receive three million each; the four that have arrived at the fourth final, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, contrary to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
A football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed income.
Barça again won its victory at the European Supercup in August 2.5 million.
However, the variable payments for which 337,8 million are provided are still available.
This money will be given in proportion to the value of each individual TV market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 allocated seats.
The master of last year receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The group of Nueva Rumasa made it possible to secure details of the purchase offer of shares yesterday, with which it would like to acquire a ceiling of between 25 % and 29.9% of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not force it to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share, which is paid for 10 years and with a 1% interest rate annually due to this shift.
Yesterday the Sos shares closed with EUR 1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa evaluates the company 18% below the market value.
According to New Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos again.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz group gives shareholders a 15-day period to share their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed about this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
At a conclusion, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to structure his management.
In the attempt to remain on the edge of possible purchase offers and the legal issues of his former manager, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal book examination.
A decision to become the first woman to have a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created post, which is directly supported by the Group's chairman.
This is all other than free from Poland, because the company is turned into a judicial battle due to the suspicion of circumvention of more than 230 million of Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will transfer further capital over the next month.
With regard to Salazar's credit yesterday, the former consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public exclusion bid of Paternina, submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion bid for Federico Paterina on 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation after it had been demonstrated that the terms and conditions of the law could be regarded as "sufficient" and thus the content of the document in question, as amended by the last 2 December.
CNMV also announced that this offer for the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paterina at the price of 7,65 Euro per share, which is around 8,95 % of the company's capital, which consists of 6,142,786 Euros in shares admitted to stock exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
Furthermore, it was also announced that 5,592,778 million shares were fixed, which could not be transferred in any way until the conclusion of the tender and whose price of Federico Paterina was fixed in accordance with the law.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of accidents and accidents, not only do KFZ workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles that were involved in an accident are dragged to the workshops, where a customer has to assess the damage caused and the cost of repair.
No single accident is the same as the calculation of costs for the parts and hours of work can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a question of minutes
For this reason, almost 100 % of the beneficiaries use these types of systems.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and maintenance collect the information they receive from manufacturers to process them afterwards and offer their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Auditex is part of the American Group of Solera, the market leader; 80% of all opinions are created with their products.
The two other companies that compete with the tool market for assessing and preparing a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is all different than simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audatex, it is collaborated with 63 manufacturers and importers, each providing the information in another format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed will grow to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have come on the market than in the previous five years.
As soon as a new car arrives on the market, the company will start working.
It is a difficult task, because each of the thousands of vehicle parts must be catagolysed and their price entered.
In addition, each model creates a "intelligent" graphics image on which you can "click" various parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much sold model, the work can be completed in one week if the procedure is in progress.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. At present, Auditex has 99.2% of the cars distributed in Spain with full information.
Among the exclusive models, for example, they have information about Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the car park on the roads, it is more than 99%.
For the purposes of carrying out documentation work and the production of databases, Auditex has over eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (usually experts for mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Auditex invests 90 million euros each year in the development of these databases.
Each month they record 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the wrong or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of the vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
Auditex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
In the review of the products offered by the Auditex, you can easily provide an overview of the type of support that they provide to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, while the Star of the AudaPlus products is a standard solution for the recovery of accidents for the recipients.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
Over the costs for the parts, it contains the repair times or the charging prices estimated by the manufacturer.
This tool is paid according to the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
At the most expensive it will be for customers who rarely use it, up to ten times a month, namely 5,75 Euro per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company, which produces thousands of opinions, negotiates the price with auditex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it came from the assembly band.
AudaGlass deals with vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is an open service for the market in the Internet, with which you can provide for vehicles that have been declared totally damaged.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or for obtaining information on differences in brand and model.
For example, you can examine how many models of a particular car brand had to be found in the workshop because of the tires or how many of them had been involved in a serious accident in a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing this type of computer tools.
It distributes among other Gt estimates, which is also intended for customers and provides the same type of digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which was established in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, damage or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT leader for opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3.100 guests and 53 insurance companies.
In the last three years, its business volume has risen by 20% annually, and in 2008 revenue was 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
On the other hand, auditex was founded in 1966 in Germany and was established in 1979 in Spain.
According to the company's sources, 62% of their business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work together with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The total turnover in the world of the Group Solera (Audex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounts to $557 million, over 3.35 million in 2008.
To this end, the company has revenues of EUR 19.1 million, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion at the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of 2.4 billion dollars.
Since 2007, they have been at the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Reference Index Standard & Poor's.
Increase of car accidents on the Internet
In October, the Solara Autoonline group purchased a platform on the Internet for the sale of automobiles and motorcycles.
This purchase represented the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85 % of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15 % next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value increases, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchasing service is exclusively applied to industry professionals such as insurance companies, customers, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers who must be registered in front of their activities.
This platform was established in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them alone in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 customers today.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market.
According to the Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose vehicle number has been registered shall no longer be on the road, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
However, cars with historical value may be allowed again, even if they have been registered after difficult authorities.
Proposal for a workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Auditex ensures that the user receives a cost proposal in just four steps:identification of the vehicle, search for spare part, creation and creation of a cost proposal.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince older professionals who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 parking cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the vehicle identification number, a graph of the model will appear and then the required spare part will be selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, discounts or discounts, and then he can print the proposal and pass it on to his customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool for assessing such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that this does not include any estimated working hours directed at the workshop.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can pay without further payment.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to be able to offer these images in three dimensional format.
This is an innovation that has been waiting for car mechanics for a long time, as you can choose a door with it for example and then turn the picture completely to look at the inside.
