Prague Bag ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions in CEZ's actions reached about half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of Tuesday's trade, reacted immediately to the fall of Monday when it fell about 6%.
The drop this time is due to the drop in action on Wall Street.
The response of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives, which refused to support the plan of stabilization of the financial sector secretary, is also expressed here.
Loss of action in Asia
The shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although during the day the index finally reduced some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Index during its financial journey marked almost four per cent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by almost 2.5 per cent.
Hang Seng China Enterprises following Chinese action movements in Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped by 3.8 per cent, in Shanghai markets were closed.
Sidney's shares lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the Index Secretary went down to 3.6 per cent.
"The rescue actions planned in the United States are uncertain and this affects the financial market of the world," said the Chief of the Hong Kong Currency Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, independent of the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
American legislators should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a threat that falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system aid plan to which $700 billion (about 12 billion crowns) should be devoted.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American actions experienced a blood bath and mainly the rate of action collected the largest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to almost seven percent. A similar drop in volume was last recorded in 1987.
The index came down before it was announced, but as soon as it was shown that the assembly's proposal was not coming forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress withdraws: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and Government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial assistance to the American financial system.
Your vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators broke up in the discussions on the adoption of the ransom plan in their form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressors must refine some details of the contract before they can make the final form of the law public and be voted on.
The financial system aid plan will be discussed on Monday at the Assembly of Representatives.
He told the agency Reuters, Barney Frank, president of the Committee on Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, "desolation" will be achieved through the complex mechanisms whose market aid will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The plan should be effective
"We have made great progress.
We resolve our dissatisfaction opinions on how the package of measures for market stabilization should be held," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi√° to Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a final form to the Government Fund.
This should buy from financial corporations unsold mortgage assets that lead financial corporations to long-term losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are about to conclude the agreement on the plan, which will work and should also be effective on the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already on it," Paulson said.
A sign for Asian business
The global financial crisis has a strong impact on the fast-moving stock market.
According to the Democratic Senator for Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are doing their best to ensure that Congress definitely approves an agreement this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' business in front of the Asian finance market, as these are the ones that are in the first hour of the month and where Congress could influence Monday's trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear with certainty about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote, and not even if they will be stuck in the last moment with any problem.
The legislators believe it will be adopted in the coming days.
The law, however, will suffer a number of changes.
The total amount of aid to the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as asked by President George Bush.
However, the Congress could block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the programme did not fulfil its function, which would amount to another $100 billion and, later, to the last 350 billion dollars.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the President may vet this decision, but the Congress may exceed its veto by a majority of votes.
In spite of these changes, the basic idea of the programme was retained to earn financial resources for the acquisition of bad mortgages whose value dropped because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to end up paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives should be prepared to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and that he values "the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy".
Limitation of the armoured contract
The President of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the programme money for the protection of taxpayers' taxes on their losses, a liberating closure of the planned financial plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called consolidated contracts for directors of the participating companies of the programme, and set up a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be addressed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress towards the agreement that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also helps homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments it purchases in order to lower monthly payments within the debtors' time limits and allow them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological aid
The proposed plan is, according to the economist head of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
"And that's why you don't know which mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be bought.
This will be crucial for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"More importantly, this week, Congressors agree on their support and give you their good vision as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that this approval is reached is, at this point, the most important," Marek insisted.
Armed hand struggle: The MP3 Player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear that it's better to buy just the phone.
There are still enough reasons for man to acquire only the breeder.
The choice depends practically on the way in which it is used and the demand for the future of its owners.
It'll probably be hard to buy the most modern toy to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
On the other hand, this type of music products such as LP discs are no longer available, and in terms of their quality there is no objective reason to continue understanding them.
If the vinyl discs with music of art rock, jazz or blues are hidden in their sheets, it is likely to be dreaming, at least, of this type of toys.
This is the same with music that is on the way, i.e. compressed, simplified music - music in MP3.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns in a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly prove the market helmets of twenty crowns.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is broad.
Also decides the duration of the battery
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even what doesn't even most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most basic functions such as calling, sending messages, playing music and video, recording both, having a better or worse camera and even able to navigate.
And when we consider the smartphone and the PDAs, they'll also have a small computer in their pocket.
This is a small miracle because no fridge knows how to make a couple and no television can take pictures.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
How many more functions are used on the mobile before the display indicator will be illuminated by requesting to be recharged.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy tragedies.
Few are the mobiles that can play more than ten or twelve hours of music, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) have clearly greater performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobiles will not reproduce for more than two hours.
If, in addition to this, above, they constantly call for even more safety a loader for work - this is also valid for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem won't have it, because even worse ones last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when you write music on the phone.
Unfortunately only a part of the devices have the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can connect directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course, it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some unrestricted reading units can connect the small memory cards used on the mobiles.
In the players, with any exception (iPod), there is no need for any special software.
Just fill the device with music through the computer's USB.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the performer, album title, gender or also according to the user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with tree structure similar to a Windows Searcher and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player is trying to use, the mobile knows more
For the selection of a specific team, it is interested in the strength of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its management.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you listen to it every day just a little while, as in the tranvision, then it's enough with any cell phone you play.
What really gets any mobile.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays the music.
The MP3 reproduces it all and, practically, almost all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most extensive and excepting it the absolute majority of devices play music in WMA format.
At least include the AAC format (the format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobiles also enable, for example, the online music purchase.
Just via the mobile Internet visit the operator's relevant pages (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could be only a weight argument to acquire a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable, and most are limited only to the successful themes that run away from radios.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, wireless internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always wear a cell phone.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you will find the cell phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends whether you always wear earpieces or, at least, handsfree.
If this is not the case, you can use an integrated player that has practically every cell, even if it is at least an MP3 player.
Probably the greatest advantage for many of the music mobiles will be their price.
The cheapest costs normally less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of an entry for classic auricules.
The best, even with regard to the technical part, such as the phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for classic earpieces, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - really manage them any person.
The minimum functions, their handling similar to the previous current tapes or also to the tocadisks are evident.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that, by mistake, we connect to the Internet with the mobile phone and, consequently, the giant account is down.
Which device to decide on
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of an appropriate card you will reach the two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped with only a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive ones have an 8 GB memory.
If you already have a mobile and want to buy another cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to capacity (up to 2 GB) more than 1,100 crowns need not be spent.
If it is considered among the most demanding lovers of echo music by the most specialized walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as one of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile walkman line has almost identical use as an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same price category over the four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the most commonly mentioned brand brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will be arriving in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, here we still need something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
He's probably not gonna be late when he gets here.
That the Czech operators are part of the most expensive Europe, we have already written it in mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed this by the Czech Telecommunications Office (CTU), which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is the most expensive of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in regulating roaming rates, there is likely to be a paradox - for some customers of Czech mobile operators sending SMS from abroad, they will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that you really want to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is an extreme competition in the Czech market.
That is why the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (CTU), Pavel Dvo≈ô√°k, said that there is no longer room for any other operator in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that for a classic operator with their own network, you no longer have too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be hard to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market that brought a significant price downturn to which the classic operators should also react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the Britain market, voices like that were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is a place for this type of operator and that they can be successful.
On the other hand, there is no need to look too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the external of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
Only after half a year did this operator get over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking, the Penta group is located which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fono.
The advantage of virtual operators is to focus on many more concrete target groups.
In addition, for them to function effectively, they are enough with many less customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, this type of virtual operators are usually profiled with low costs - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that are often opposed to the offer of more adjusted services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half of the prices with respect to competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good blow to bet for a trivial target group.
This operator is specifically directed at man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - is the operator who likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if it's like a concept that Poland could get stuck in our country.
Therefore, Vodafone's spokesman Miroslav ƒåepik: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the offer of services, it is relatively satisfied"
There is no possibility in the Czech Republic, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be any virtual operator in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too hopeful.
It is more about the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region," said Jana Studniƒçkov√°, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
He indirectly assured that the current mobile telephony operators in the Czech Republic were definitely not involved in this idea.
Instead, they try to do their best to avoid any potential competition.
Interest in launching a virtual mobile operator already shows that the Novera GTS group would like to take a step forward to become a real competition of Phone O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, in order to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephone services but also mobile telephony.
And how much earlier, better.
With this possibility, we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile telephony operators.
With some of them we have managed to move forward at the meetings," said the group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Well, maybe they'll see better times.
It appears that, for non-official information, the first official operator would have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"We now believe that the situation is ideal for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market in comparison with others is a very specific market.
Until now no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project on this site," said Vlastimil Sr≈°enƒõ, spokesman for Telef√≥nica O2.
The specificity of the Czech market concerns other operators.
The spokesman for T-mobile, Martina Kemrov√°, in accordance with the opinion of O2, adds: "So far we have not recorded any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop."
And he adds: "On the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find some virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this point, we should already have a specific contract on the table that would be possible to study in such short horizons."
Vodafone directs its attention rather to meeting the own requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav ƒåepik√Ω adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this concerns the cost-sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this to be the greatest contribution from the customers' point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on the mobile."
Offices responsible - with uncooked and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a lower price and thus to a decrease in profits.
Then why facilitate entry into competition?
When the operators want to get something, they're able to get out of the same line, proof of that is the grip when U:phone came out.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on CTU was at the time of U:fono's entry into the T-Mobile society.
It is certified by the public information available on the CTU's website.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov√° adds: "In addition, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator.
With regard to the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would be subject to him and, above all, to his major requirements."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging because of the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the CTU, which unfortunately has no power to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (UOHS).
However, this expressed its typical attitude to this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after a contract on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile telephony operator and a virtual operator is concluded.
So far no convention has been concluded since the offer of the potentials concerned was not sufficiently interesting for the classic operators," added Kristi√°n Chalupa, of the Department of External Relations of the √öOHS.
These statements are not surprising to the representatives of the operators.
For offices that must represent consumer interests, this is more than a consideration, apart from that, they must note that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In the foreign country where virtual operators normally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to lower prices for mobile telephony services"
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and the downturn in prices does not come within the interest of the √öOHS.
Indeed, the dramatic shock in all of this is in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it is really a coincidence is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of petrol in the gas pipelines because it is clear that it is the work of randomity and a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office has not found any evidence of unfair competition in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position therefore do not have a corresponding rise in liability in their market operations.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are, rather, missing, as well as telecommunications regulators," added Chalupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is, of course, a relevant market analysis developed by the CTU, according to which telecommunications is from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge, the agreement with the network administrator is always necessary.
And the mobile phone operator - with all its logic - has the monopoly of its network.
Therefore, in a specific segment it must be dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for √öOHS, it should be a warning that three mobile operators appear in a similar way.
Current complaints from interested parties (including the so-called GTS Novera company) show that many similar obstacles occur in all negotiations with operators.
Loading responsibility in the CTU is a fairly common trick in the telecommunications field of which the √öOHS washes hands in all this matter.
We've already met with him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law for the extension of CTU's competition in the field of non-effective commercial tenders was introduced recently, even when a number of experts promised that the situation would improve.
This must be fully known by the representatives of √öOHS, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one sees
At the same time, unexpectedly something as well as a pseudovirtual operator continues to work that in the Czech mobile networks already exist a few.
They are companies that place their own prices on mobile telephony services that, however, are only one part public.
These are usually companies dedicated to multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile telephony services.
Usually only some of these companies get the price list.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the same by charging a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile telephony operators prohibit that type of return.
"If cases such as those cited could be found to be in breach of contract conditions that could be translated at the end of the partnership with the given society," answered Martina Kemrov√°.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity by mobile telephony operators would not reach responsible people.
It is precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned, that there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are opposed to this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they receive no negligible profits and, at the same time, unlike genuine virtual operators, they in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav ƒåep√Ωk warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows for a speculation of this kind, however, the services of this company are used only by a surprising amount of a hundred customers.
These should also accept that your phone's SIM card is not on its name, so they can't have it at all as a normal operator's client."
This is exactly what should seem to you to be at least strange.
There is also a new question for the UOHS.
If mobile telephony operators surround their eyes in this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that √öOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not to be desired it should not be satisfied with the explanations by operators that they have no idea of this history and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant decline in service prices.
At the same time, practically in all countries where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators tried to protect themselves from this breakdown.
The arguments used by these were practically all identical - too small, a market, possibly too saturated, problems with the quality of the service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases have defended operators but their clients.
It was with formal measures or informal pressure that the first virtual operator emerged and with him began to emerge more.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory body all this happens as if it were a burning key.
Because of our experience, we cannot let ourselves be impressed that the confusion of the assignments in these cases is appropriate to them.
But we won't be disappointed.
If this information is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market is likely to start moving again.
If any of the operators let in to any virtual mobile telephony operator, it will be difficult for the √öOHS to remain indifferent to the refusal (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol√°nek, on the day of the Czech official celebrations, presented the new official recording of the hero Where, my home.
The new anthem recorded the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji≈ô√≠ Bƒõlohl√°vek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one male voice and one female voice, one with Coro and another instrumental.
Part of the canto is responsible for Katerzyna Knie≈æinkov√° y Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the Heno arrangements are Otakar Jerem√°≈° and Jaroslav Krƒçek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Bƒõlohl√°vek considers this national Czech song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio already said before that he deliberately chose for the Singing Solos with voices representatively young who are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with the two and then, also, with the Qur'an that are fixed in the sentence so that the text is well understood, so that it is consonant," he said.
The Czech official anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home sounded for the first time in 1834 at the State Theatre tables in the original Czech work Fidlovaƒçka by Josef Kajet√°n Til and arranged with the music by Franti≈°ek ≈†kroup.
He won popularity and people made it their own.
The first strofa of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, part of the official hymn.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the rise of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
The Prague MDD takes us Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, it is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, transit and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at the moment by almost one hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day bonus, 90-day and annual (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time load it on their chip card at the info centers and stations of the transport company at the stations of the Metro, Museum, M≈Østek, N√°dra≈æi Holeshovice, Andel, Roztyly, Let≈àany, Kobylisy, Rajsk√° zharada, Kaƒçerov and Luka.
The bonds can be purchased from yesterday on the website of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the Internet as a form of trade can definitely start to forget the ticket sales positions at the subway stations, where they had to make a regular queue to get a normal ticket so far.
The bonus is purchased online, and the Opencard card recharges it in one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have a window with prepared staff that helps interested people with online purchases and also with the recharge of the bonus purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrny.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus in the Opencard in the automatic uploading machines located in some of the metro lobbys.
How are these exhausting machines?
They are red, they remind us of a machine to pick up tickets, and travellers will probably already be placed in them at the stations of the metro of Roztyly, Budjejovick√°, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk√°.
"Now there are five in the city but at the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrny completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just enter in it the Opencard chip card and the bonus previously paid will be loaded only in it.
Electronic bonds since tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on the surrounding trains and bus lines from the 300 to 499 numbers that mainly use the inhabitants of the locations of central Bohemia.
"In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague, there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and area of the bonus," explained the control of the tickets, Filip Dr√°pal of the Ropid organization that sets out the schedules for the collective transport of Prague.
The surrounding buses have their reading cards mounted in the driver's pocket.
When entering, it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard at the place intended for it on the side of the Fund.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Dr√°pal said.
Passengers who do not travel on the surrounding buses and do not remember when they are finished the validity of the bonus can be sent to the issuing machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will see information about the validity of your document.
The South wanted to be part of the United States in a referendum
The German Sudettes requested that Fumaba be part of the United States in 1945.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the US patronage.
With this desire, some groups of Germans from the Sudette addressed the president of the United States in 1945.
It results from the letters that are stored in a particular file and that are now stored in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov ask the American president in a letter that does not allow the return of the "Terra ≈†umava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - again to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want his word that the American units are reaching German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed with a "people who carry the destiny of Shumava in their hearts".
Given that the union of Czechoslovakia with the southern Germans is supposedly - according to this, the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, neglect, incomprehensibility, pressure and slavery, the authors pray in the letter to the American president who assumes today and forever to ≈†umava under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that, without considering the opinion of four million people, we are handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that it works in full collaboration with the victory of allies," the letter writes.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is probably the fear of reprisals of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States suspected doubts about this idea of the Germans, he would simply organize a referendum on whether his inhabitants want to be part of the United States or live under their patronage.
Despite the fact that the text of the letter, with the knowledge we have in the post-war history, may sound a little childish, according to some specialists at length paints the expectations of the Germans in the south-east of then.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least be aware that they were going to deal with their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate some clear form of autonomy for the Sudan.
Others thought they'd stay in Czechoslovakia.
It is confirmed by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice.
This was in the war, as a German of Budƒõjovice, surrounded by the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war, the British rushed him and placed him in the prison camp of Holstein dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, the Czech would welcome them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, believed that on the basis of the Orders of Benes they would be separated from the Republic.
Don't think - pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most direct action in Czech history towards road safety.
In this way, the emotional campaign that decided to launch the Ministry of Transport in the media could be characterized.
The minister's office, Ale≈° R√©b√≠ƒçek, promises to discourage the drivers of dangerous conduct on the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be heard on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and in brochures.
I'd have to discourage the high-speed driver and the alcoholic on the wheel.
And also to remind them that before the belts are put in place, the belts are attached.
He wants to come to the awareness of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that embitter emotions.
And that's why the "sanguinary" announcements all over the campaign are bearing witness to us:
Don't think - pay!
The word "Don't Think" is written in large letters in the matrix.
And in a blood tank is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that at a time of dismissal man can get paid with his own life.
The ads are going to "fear" the viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be seen.
Promises that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG.
Sugar and latex for drivers
"To drivers, the sugar and latex system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red semaphorus is passed and so saves time.
The latigo is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says Hospital Psychologist Na Homolce, Martin Ko≈ô√°n.
And that is why an information campaign is needed in the press, and mainly a negative advertising, which is the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," warned Ko≈ô√°n.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the Israeli Provisional Government, Ehud Olmert, spoke of the restoration of practically all lands occupied in 1967, that is, West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Highs of the Golan, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
It was proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will necessarily have to return almost all the lands (occupied) if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"Surely we will stay with a few percent of these lands, but we will have to give the Palestinians one percent similar (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the event of a refund, this would also include Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as he passed to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out in reference to the two July attacks in the city where several dead and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the mountain of the Temple, a sacred and historic place" within the old city.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work," he insisted later.
Removal of the Highs of the Golan
Olmert also spoke of the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Highs, which from his point of view is an inherent condition for a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also entail concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan," he warned.
"Syrians well know what they're going to have to get rid of to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, abandon their relations with Hizbula (the Chit movement), withdraw from the permanent support that causes Hamas (the Chit movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and the Yihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are the hits on the buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
With regard to the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padova, the question arises as to whether the passengers and passengers can be moved by the bus during the trip.
"If we wish to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of azafata is opposed to the law of road traffic," says the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which he died last week was the ass of twenty years, evidently caused by the driver of the truck only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place of the vehicle despite having reserved two other places.
However, the bus may have an accident or a sudden stop, and at the exact moment when the snack divides the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with standing places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency do not have places to walk, as confirmed by the company's director Radim Janchura, Aktualnƒõ.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, this was withdrawn and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is on the move if they have a seat," he said.
Azafata doesn't know the law
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the azafata - no legal provision clarifys this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term of the vehicle auditor, whose rights and obligations are not defined," he adds, less mysteriously, spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorny, thinks that the law takes sufficient care of this problem.
"It depends whether the bus has the approval allowed to have standing places.
That's all," he says.
The buses are divided among the urbans, where there are places to be on foot and at maximum speed, interurban with places to be on foot with a greater speed permit and long distances without places to go on foot, with the highest speed permit and seats equipped with a safety belt.
As on the plane, the expert says
The safety expert from BESIP in transport, Jaroslav Hor√≠n, does not see any major problems with the traffic of the bus.
"In the course of the development of the journey, there is not much danger, the situation can be compared with the service on the aircraft.
Not even here is the safety of the turbulence and the stroke can be hit in the head."
"However, if the bus suddenly stops clearly that the physical laws are valid.
Same as on a city bus or on the tram.
The safety of the trap must solve it by the transporter's internal rules," he says and also thinks that from the point of view of law this problem is not solved.
Janchura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only transporter who offers the snack service.
He employs two hundred.
The Director, not after the accident, considers this work risky.
"However, at the moment I feel that the seat of azafat is at risk, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, by entering.
It would even save costs," he says.
In the interest of security, it is the reason that Asiana lacks touch on her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, which runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have any bites, we've been against them since the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for T√Ωden.cz.
There was a huge tragedy.
In the accident of the line joining Naples, a young man named Pilsen died who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking cart blocking the pass to the bus. without using the intermittents.
His driver tried to avoid it in a fast maneuver, however, he shocked with the right front.
Janchura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the azafata were sold.
"These sites can't be reserved for long distance connections, they're blocked."
The company intends to demand the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family, but also wait for financial expenses for the guilty party.
Law reform?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring more precision on the movement of the asphalt on the bus in which thirty experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working for a year.
"However, no concrete conclusion has been reached.
They are not too dedicated to the buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile during the journey," says expert Hor√≠n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the hits to be a major threat to passenger safety," concluded spokesman Hanzelka, saying that bus safety control is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf's hope is supported in Frankfurt
In the letter of the West LB Bank's Board of Directors for its collaborators, there are no big words.
Due to the merger of the Dusseldorf bank units with DEKA bank, a central capital market of the financial group of Sparkassen can be formed, as the letter states, published on Monday
The West LB bank, breaking the ‚Äòcompetence block‚Äô with sustainable profit capacity, would come into this business.
In addition, such a merger may be a beginning for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
This is how the text is understood when a joint directive wants to show the ability to act in a long time.
Because just like the West LB is under a lot of pressure.
Not only the part of the European Union, but also the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services recently made it clear to the Government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time to find a solution.
For a long time now, also on the part of Frankfurt, much is said about the union of this kind between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know for their investment funds, and the West LB.
In other words, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA bank, presenting the data after a half a year at the end of August, said he saw no sense in the bank's merger, located on Mainzer Stra√üe Street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the DEKA Board of Directors, which is now composed of the regional banks and Sparkassen associations, has called for joint directives to start negotiations with West LB on common commercial activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, as stated in the financial website.
This is not the first time in the area of consolidation in the area of Sparkassen the name of the DEKA bank appears, which with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003, the situation seemed to be such that the DEKA bank could merge with the Regional Bank of Renania-Palatinate and with Helaba.
This initiative to create a union of three parties has failed.
Only the plans were made public, the government of Hesse expressed its opposition to the participation of Helaba in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-W√ºrttemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But lastly, G√ºnther Merl, the president of the Helaba Joint Directive, expressed his opposition to the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Independent of this seems to be more clear than the integration of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Thus, when the elections of the Bavarian parliament are to take place, the BayernLB union with the Baden-W√ºrttemberg regional bank could make progress.
For Helaba that is not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure continues to merge, Helaba will miss the partners to do so.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although it has so far been much better than the financial crisis that the buildings of Stuttgart and Munich made it.
On the other hand, Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, who owns 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided coexistence plans with the West LB.
In any case, only the North LB is left.
But such geostrategic reflections form only one part.
On the other hand, it is the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a commercial model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, so that the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband had not yet given any answer.
Finally, West LB can be decomposed, but that, of course, is not the bank's own wish.
Thus, also in the letter of the Bank's Board of Directors, it is said that a complete solution would be sought for the whole bank.
As the coexistence between individual parts of the bank can be combined with DEKA, that's going to show time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "the weekend of Italians"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca it's the third or fourth.
But this time, he sees Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a barrel of 5 liters of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge bone tiger showing almost 200 participants in Oktobfest that low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a palm, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From there, from the parking next to the train station Porta Nuova, tonight at 23:45, three buses come out, `Munich direction, the beer party', expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are intended mainly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the parking corners next to their flag are singing South American, they had already started to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather foreman and forks with silver-coloured slippers, belongs to these buses.
They've been coming to Octoberfest for five years, considering that only three trips this year.
At night on the road there, during the day on the beach, at 22.30 p.m. the return.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the law of the purity of Bavaria, sickness insurance and the German guide- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the Queen's tranquillity on the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the forces.
They stop in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian enrolment take another stop on the bus 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco group is scheduled to arrive at 6.30 p.m. in the parking next to the Teresa Prado, there are already about 50 other buses across Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are meeting, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, you put on a yellow hat.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to a gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "concersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the campaign shop are opened, that means marching!", Marco shouted in the morning.
"Go!" went and took the back seats at the campaign store.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and all with yellow hats you don't sit in the same bench, divided by all space!"
A liter of beer, red Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Do not forget the propinium
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
Just get out of his place, he'll be busy!"
Third, "This afternoon exactly at ten and a half you have to come here!" Do you understand?
And now everybody's going to October party.
One, to mark the road, even the yellow hats in the trees, traffic signs and even in a poster of the elections of a great Popular Party in Bavaria.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Octoberfest known as "the weekend of Italians"
There are no accurate data on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who travel on the Alps and who are tormented in the campaigns, 10 percent of all of them came especially this weekend in Italy.
The Munich Police receive assistance from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers assist the Red Cross of Bavaria who makes a statistics of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, take the lead in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and the Austrians.
The favorite Italian campaign shop is called Hofbr√§uzelt.
Nights without sleeping for the creditors of the Real Estate Hypo
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, only the Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbr√ºck stressed last week.
However, that the politician would use the word "relatively" and added that the German banking area would also be affected by critical trends.
And that's what happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich's real estate fund, which is quoted in the DAX index, receives from a consortium of German banks a loan of billions to resist disturbances on the market.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well said to Reuters: credit aid amounted to EUR 35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Real Estate Hypo will use must be of interest.
Money comes from private banks as well as from public law.
The cause of this is the losses of the Depfa branch.
According to one report, the state finances with the money that was provided for the long-term projects only provided them for a short period of time, which is no longer possible, because of market mistrust.
In the first half of the year, the capital reserve of the cash bank has fallen by 95 per cent, EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio has also delayed a little from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Compared with the same period last year, the continued income of financial investments and net profits of financial transactions fell to zero, the debt-in-debt income and some securities securities also dropped by more than 70 per cent from the disbursement of the provision of credit operations, by EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the high and high revenues of the reimbursement of the costs of restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and the businesses organised for the consortium companies, the negative balance could be charged with a deficit of approximately 16 per cent more.
After privatization in 1990, the former state finances at the beginning were lost in speculation with industrial credits for buildings, which served as a reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
As much money could not be earned with the financing of state projects, the Defa started to devote intensively to projects in the area of infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private investors and as well as state (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and was diversified.
Now the Real Estate Hypo has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of the group's losses and gains, it is said very inaccurate.
It's a fact that the dividends have cancelled.
By 2007, they had been cancelled to two thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa, the Real Estate Hypo became a major state and financial in the area of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own customer deposits, it, in comparison with other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the collapse of the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers, what has happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans was essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year, the Real Estate Hypo takes almost EUR 50 billion to finance a part of the Defa credit portfolio of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the report of the Real Estate Hypo Bank, the bank covers with a credit the need for the group's financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international monetary markets that are now essentially not capable of operating"
Other sources say that this money guarantees refinancing until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, president of the Real Estate Hypo Board, explained that the Real Estate Group would not need the monetary markets for the foreseeable time.
The German Central Bank and the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services (BaFin) are based on the fact that the competitiveness of the Real Estate Group is now guaranteed.
That has to wait for the bank's shareholders and creditors.
But because of the dynamics and impedability of the crisis, there is no consensus.
It is even imaginable that there is no need for funding in its full volume.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
There was a voice that in the last Sunday's time the bank was still almost in insolvency, so temporary rescue can also not calm at least people concerned.
The price of action fell to 75 per cent, EUR 3.30.
On the contrary, loan courses are really good.
While priority debt almost does not change, loans' courses according to the position in the property register clearly tend to be low.
In particular, loans from the former subsidiary W√ºrttemberg Hypo are affected and the loans whose dividends expire in 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the bank crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Real Estate Hypo, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the issuing banks, governments and banks that are not affected are still ready to support the system, so long as pension amortization can be started within the deadline.
Or something's going to happen, which can't be imagined - the financial crisis will be over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-reports on partial stabilization, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justifiable hope.
That's going to be a reason, because the creditors will spend the night without sleep, breaking their head over the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
The short-term investors can still put the end point and use the transport to a new account of the losses for future payment of compensation benefits on change in the future.
Sylvana and the Secrets of Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to be present at the Tachibana High School, the girls began to laugh: "The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges she counts Japan.
"The first day in a college in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to college, I was scared.
I live on the coast of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I will train 40 minutes to the Tachibana High School.
I just had to find the way, I was lucky I didn't lose.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not as strict as in my home in Baja Sajonia.
From eight in the morning the students come, at nine or twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had been touched to introduce myself.
Moreover, I am not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform, I got an old skirt from my host family's mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, that's how I put it to the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo She Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week my birthday will be.
I was very happy at this time because I had been studying this language for two years now.
All 31 girls in the class have cooked, recited and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my Mangas.
That belongs to the Japanese girls' survival vocabulary and means "mona, beautiful"
Then I slipped quickly into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I really felt upset.
Everyone talked at the same time, they would laugh and ask a lot of questions - at the same time it was very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in the recreation they all took their Bentos out.
My family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else that boring pieces of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sauces, pepper salad and algae, fruit and something like meat in tofu mass.
In most cases I have no idea what it is like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of marine surgeons in the salt, buff!
In Japanese schools sales are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a gift made in a very artistic way for a boy and is given it in hopes of being able to get to know him better during a recreation.
I read about it in my Manga Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a year's school.
Then he always answered:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
Finally for years I have preferred to read Mangas.
In order to understand comics and culture better, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me, it was absolutely certain that one day I would travel there.
Also because I have a bottle of tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still haven't felt lost here, although Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a shark feeling the danger is running away, why is he also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, a neurology scientist, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you control whether they, acting in the same way as us, feel the same way?
The contributions of famous scientists have been published in an Internet magazine called "Edge" for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have feelings and other states of conscience without me or anyone else could prove it so far, even though we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown area because hardware does not match.
When a rat is at risk, it does the same thing as the other animals: it is killed, fled or attacked.
People behave in a similar way, so some scientists draw conclusions on comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to contaminate our subjective experience with animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the frontal lobe of the brain cortex (due to their participation in short memory and the executive functions that lead to conduct).
This vast part is much more developed in the case of people than those of the other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of brain cortex, including knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man is different from other primates.
Another particularity is in man's linguistic nature: As most of his experience is combined with language, it often means that consciousness depends on her.
In this case animals may be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created anyway, in many cases would differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That's why it's hard to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is neither allowed to be measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it allowed to be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions relate to the content of conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during short-term memory studies, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential thing goes rather to the neutral correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both can be similar or not.
Curiously, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of brain cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what is the result of that for sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens to fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupys a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
Given this point of view, the sensations are very fixed apart from the brain cortex, which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, there are classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar in order to describe the states of others by pair of ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the other hand, thinks that sensations are derived from simple activities of the parts of the brain cortex responsible for body feelings and the brain trunk, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the brain trunk.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can be absolutely referring to different types and feelings.
For theoretical reasons, I can't go against it, but I don't think it's possible.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as afraid, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control whether rats and men acting in a similar way feel the same way?
Seeing the danger a cockroach flees, can you be afraid?
I believe that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That‚Äôs true that the neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, the sharks on the other hand do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain trunk responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: how can it be tested in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also sharks (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally distinct from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress is expected in the field of neurology as well as in rats and men.
As I don't investigate the language and the consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
It can be said that I don't see beyond my noses, but I'd rather go ahead than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Ivan Wasjunik, the Deputy Prime Minister, said that preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government views UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of Ukraine's ability to organize Europe's championship together with Poland," Vasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Now work is about to begin and there is much to be done in both countries."
The time for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in host countries is short.
The number of stadiums is likely to be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do work very quickly," said the president of a Ukrainian Association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA won't take our eyes off."
A more radical step was taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish PZPN association and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The commission met at the request of the sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN is unable to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that the preparation of the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many first division clubs were condemned because of down-down manipulation to the lower category, eventually also the division council had to be postponed.
Contraattaque de Dennis Quaid Angry
She wanted to promote a new film, she spoke in an interview about private life - and she has problems with her ex-wife: Hollywood Meg Ryan's star named her ex-wife as an adulterer.
He's angry and counter-attacked.
The late war of the two roses in the former pair of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for revealing private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his appointment as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard how many times Meg tells the stories of our relationship in another version," the 54-year-old man told "New York Daily News".
Among other things, it's very "so sorry" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again "will remember in public the pain and changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is newly married and recently is a twin pope.
And then he ends up with his statements, highlighting: "Be as my life continues.
I'm happy because I have a wonderful family that's okay."
Flight and hotel tickets prices are low
In the first half of 2008, airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, air tickets in Germany were made cheap even up to 50 percent.
Flight tickets and overnight stays at hotels were made cheap again - this is the results of a study by the travel service provider and the financial services of American Express.
The company has analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter has found a major change in the second half.
After many years the prices on the hotel market continued to increase, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased by 6.9 per cent on average.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6 per cent compared last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the reason that "the interest of American tourists in travelling declined."
The decline in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hann√≥ver, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the city of Norway, hotel prices increased to 26.3 per cent and thus beat a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, flight ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, travellers in the Economy class had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-distance flights even became more expensive until 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of the airline tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, decreased by an average of 12.5 per cent, but the price changes for Business Class and FirstClass were small.
In Germany, price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9 in the second half to 23.6 per cent.
According to one study, prices for national flights in Germany even decreased by half.
The cause of price change is partly the increase in the fleet economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the travel market with the aircraft, demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies Treaty which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit flights in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared in failure - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the SV in Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia still does not go out to make the tenth grade goal.
Christopher Klein presented very well the forced landing of the player of the national selection Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed by making a goal.
All I meant was by reacting exactly to the incident, you could read it clearly from your lips.
I just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," silbaby Hermann Rieger at the entrance of the stadium in Hamburg.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over, and most of the guests were back in their seats.
Rieger was almost three decades physiotherapist of HSV, with a very large reputation as one of those forming part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach sat with his head and raised his fingers in a sign of consent.
Cornelius is Martin Jol's brother, the chief coach in Hamburg.
His order was the same: Go, the second goal!
But that wasn't done.
"Today everything wasn't nice to see," Marcel Jansen added.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have it "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with its head impact; and also the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
This Monday, the SV in Hamburg is going to be 121 years old.
The Saturday of being the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stage and the table change on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," said Marcel Jansen.
It provides that the partial qualifications of the table correspond more to the veil of the league than to the domination of its HSV.
The hippo with its players forced late like the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Petric swallow as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to join, but the hippo still can't shine with its successes.
"We need more than feeling and dribbling," Jol says.
After the defeat of the vote
The Wall Street is spreading fear.
The first news about the failure of the bank's rescue package left the Down Jones to 700 points in a certain period.
That was the loss of the biggest points during one day in your history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little bit.
About 20:30 one of the most important barometers in the world rated a deficit of 5 per cent in 10,579 units.
Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained in 1548 points.
At this point, the biggest loser in the Dow Jones were American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
The shares of the Goldmann Sachs bank lost almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, a big investor Warren Buffet had participated financially in the company.
The rescue plan plans to make available resources to buy so-called "potridian mortgages".
But the sum will be paid by strike but step by step.
As a compensation for this, the State has to receive the discretionary receipts of actions for financial partnerships that may be charged during the course development to reduce the financial burden of the state box.
Action courses in Europe and the USA continue to decline
The aid of billions for banks in Europe and the US does not calm investors.
The course of the actions of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate lowers and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the rescue of the state-designed financial market, the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculative actions of the Real Estate Hypo and Commerzbank led to the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the rescue actions of the federal government and private banks, Munich's property finance has lost two thirds of its value for a period of time, the Commercial Bank has lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and costed a deficit of 3.7 per cent in 5,839 units.
Financial markets have fallen worldwide.
The opening of Wall Street's day in New York began with remarkable losses.
Investors fear that the savings package of $700 billion from the U.S. government is not enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent until it remained at 10,809,25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue project, and the Senate vote could be the first of October.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the main Japanese index of Nikkei after profits fell to 1.26 per cent in 11.743,61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index dropped by 2.1 percent to 18.286,90 points.
In India, the main index of Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 per cent and ended in 12,595,75 units.
Following the announcement of capital expansion, Arcandor's actions were lost in the MDax.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim signed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the trade and tourism consortium announced that the participation in the Thoms Cook company will not be sold.
Dark matter affects the path of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has caused the dissertation of researchers: the Dark Matter has influenced the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Relativity Theory cannot be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying into the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are now freezing a death in the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver, has led to the dissatisfaction among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a manoeuvre of the spatial probes' trajectories while they achieve acceleration using the energy of the planet's gravitational field, for example from Earth.
This allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Sun Ulysses probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: The missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected according to the venerable law of gravity.
It is more common to see irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly have a higher or lower speed.
The physicists could not explain this effect until now.
It was called anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maniobra.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the General Theory of Albert Einstein's Relativity that describes the force of attraction of matter through the curve of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton now solemnly believes as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what remained astronomers in the universe.
"The reason for anomaly can be the Dark Matter that can also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The researchers in the universe have known the existence of the Dark Matter for only ten years.
It is supposed to possess the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible which means it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists, the Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed, after ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of rescue.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The rescue negotiations have already begun.
Germans always fall back to the point of attention of the kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper tells about the most important cases.
In view of this, European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are free.
The same information is provided by the Egyptian state television, the Arab Al-Arab television broadcaster and the Italian media.
After news of the release in the Italian release Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian Foreign Minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
'Now we control your health,' said Frattini.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are well and are in security, informs the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants in the expedition in the desert are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible is the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue," the guard said.
It was only a matter of "receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, the Sudanese soldiers have killed six kidnappers and two of them have detained in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded a rescue from Germany in the amount of six million euros; the money had to deliver the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that liberation was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, kidnappers intend to release female hostages after receiving the rescue.
The men had to be arrested until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
Germany's embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Patriarch abuse "carried to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Treise, 57 years old, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight charges of innocent assaults.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an indagatory study, knew that he had regularly approached his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Treise wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for your death."
The court knew that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
At the time when the girl lived in Coventry, Treise used to draw her and sell her eyes before carrying out her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Treise came back to live in Cornwall.
His daughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Mrs Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had suffered twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said about her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "refused to life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his apartment in Plymouth.
Ms. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by sinking through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that concludes by saying, "I used to grab her and throw her eyes away.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Treise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for his victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim leaving his own life.
More clearly, if she had not done so, the matter would probably not have ended in court."
And he added: "I have noticed the effect that, according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother, abuse was on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that an official of the Cabinet who forgot some secret documents on the train in June would be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on his way to work by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is certainly a less serious burden under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention to commit a crime.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the protection of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official should be charged with the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Secret Service Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information on Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then moved from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain construction companies could face a price of over 80,000 pounds after the rescue/savement of the Bradford and Bingley bank.
The Government, in fact, provided 14 billion pounds to protect the bank ' s 2.6 million savings.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies using the savings, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Building Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers that companies and their members must pay
Eventually, the 14 billion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley's mortgages are redeemed.
However, the interest in the interior is assumed to be charged annually to the 700 financial corporations with deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies were included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently ... are called to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and the mediation companies had to pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will rise to 450 thousand pounds in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover 81,000 pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Commercial Association of Building Societies, told the BBC that this situation was unfair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent."
According to the BSA, there is no data to indicate the failure of some society since 1945.
"We will need to consider all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options there are to protect construction companies and their members against what might be a relevant price," Mr. Cole added.
The interest gained in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, this will be a full year of required interests, which can be almost twice as much.
Being the building societies of mutual organizations and without shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interests in their savings.
The price of milk goes up by five pence per litre
The inhabitants of Jersey Street will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pounds a litre since next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two fifths in February and following investigations carried out by a consulting company.
Traders can decide on their own whether they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had increased before February was in 2002.
Refusal of freedom under bail to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the request for bailout for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be led to prison when she returns to her country.
His defenders said that the court did not grant him liberty under bail by accusing him of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various allegations of corruption against you.
His long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released under bail at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's military-supported government grant her full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while he was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is now not clear what the terms of his release are or whether he will be able to remain free when he returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers said they would appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request for freedom under bail for Sheikh Hasina, arguing that he could not obtain freedom under bail because he was already being treated abroad under parole," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall bring an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her defenders argued that she needed the freedom under bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after 17 October, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the interim government, supported by the army, took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all the charges they are charged with.
Fears for the campaign against poliomyelitis in Afghanistan
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan ‚Äì says the UN ‚Äì have not been able to take advantage of a recent anti-polyomielitis vaccination campaign due to the violence of the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations has implemented a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that children could not be reached in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
One UN spokesman said that despite the promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or impeded thousands of officials while they were carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge in ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision it required the company to reduce its participation in the rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Appeal that it will have to reduce its participation in ITV below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously said that BSkyB's interests hampered competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its package of actions in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, by buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopolis Office reported that the acquisition of ITV participation by BSkyB raised doubts about ITV independence and encouraged the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin's boss, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, noted that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was not reasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, said BSkyB, it would have delivered its voting rights.
New Investigation into the Assumption of U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the conduct of the administration officials.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the legislators and the former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officers interviewed during the investigation have lied to the investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Greed allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from their office by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision, suggesting that the lawyers had been dismissed for low performance.
But later it was assumed that lawyers had not been judged worse than their colleagues, and many observers concluded that the dismissals would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked to prosecute Republicans, high profile Congress members, while others had refused to investigate electoral fraud complaints against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government
and can be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the fired, resigned.
A number of other officials from the Department of Justice did the same.
The General Prosecutor's report is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and underlines how he had a "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, which "abdicated" his leadership position and was "notably non-cooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Epica de Meat Loaf of a lot of honor
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for its epic hero Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special prize next week at the ceremony that will take place in London, said that getting this recognition would be "an honor".
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf won in 1977.
The Coldplay group are taking the nominations for this year's awards and making the four categories classification.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that go beyond time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity such as that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the hen.
The song was first known as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and became number 15 in the ranking.
However, Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf remained in the classifications for about nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for her cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute larynx forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it emerged that there was a silence in his vocal string.
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, bullies, streets and other roads, some famous, others just serving.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-term local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends to the North of the First Street ‚Äì before I found the Second Street ‚Äì between the Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This street, more than 30 feet wide and 120 long, resembles a dusty street more than an active road.
There are no signs.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on the First Street
who wants to renovate Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and shops that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the old-day neighbors who commented they were delighted by the trolley simply because it is one of the last remains of the past of the block before the fitting of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Conservation and Development of the city, which has street control, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Committee on the Victims of Land Use this month, the representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the Committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, as Susan Stetzer, the Community District Manager No. 3 said.
"The city is very few spaces owned today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," she said.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street came out for the first time during this month's meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that despite the company's desire to use the street, he did not necessarily want to own it.
"The primary concern of Avalon Bay is the renewal of this abandoned street and the possibility of converting it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson of the Committee for Preservation, confirmed that it was a city's desire to sell it to the street and noted that the agency's mission was the development of property rather than its management.
Compared to its more colourful surroundings, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a trail in history.
Some believe that he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great estate was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The rear door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opens in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photography of the establishment that comes out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about East Village gambling, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that even modest public goods must remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, practically without changes, a king of the city that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Biterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk about the city's history on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little narrow and unexplained street, also dark for the day and marked by doors of oxidized iron and counter-ventane storage, with old weekly newspapers blown along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stood near the door used to enter the CBGB and now welcomes a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-oz beer bottle were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely paid attention in Extra Place, but suggested that a cleaning could be done.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimated the attractive power of the street in their current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet and dry places."
The debate on bilingualism: interference in English
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in studies on California and director of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling the Spanish voters effectively is a difficult business.
The educational proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of this.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "African Americans and Latin students have significantly less chances of graduating than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
In order to combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, inter alia, "bilingual transition education" for English students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers instruction in languages other than English, is effective in canceling the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern region of the county of Los Angeles.
In this school, the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low income:
Over a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are learning English.
However, an incredible 100 per cent of students in the fourth year, has been positively evaluated in the 2008 mathematical review.
and almost a equally amazing 93 percent have dominated the English language test and art.
This incredible success has been achieved by using a different ingredient that Mr. Obama favoured.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes the review and practice, the constant assessment of competences and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
In addition, and here is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the head of the Sixth Street, the school's approach to English instruction for students is in the "total entry".
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of language in the treatment of the content of instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "We have had extraordinary success with students like this last one that has come from Mexico and that, if you entered the school 12 months later, you would not be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we believe it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate for other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of their party on the issue of education (the Associations for National Education have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their own constant support for bilingual education obscures Mr. Obama's prediction of the answer.
Although immigrants must learn English, Mr Obama has recently tripled the issue by leaving people to stop worrying about the legislation that is written only in English.
and instead, he said, "You must make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well rather than ignore them or trivialize them.
The price of oil falls abruptly after renewed economic fears
The oil price was drastically reduced this Monday because of the concern that the US ransom plan for financial markets may not be able to re-activate the economy.
The crude oil shares decreased from 7 per cent to $99.80 in the morning negotiations at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped from more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial crisis at Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before returning, once again, due to enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety took over from investors, once again, on Monday, despite the Congress leaders who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the biggest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that took place in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will purchase the bank operations of the Wachovia Corporation, as the government said this Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the Fortis European financial conglomerate.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, in the late weekend, the negotiations that led to the rescue agreement "seemed to have been unable to re-activate the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for basic products, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The prospects for global equity, the rate of interest and exchange will be increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that basic products cannot escape this contamination.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is whether the American virus will spread worldwide and specifically to China. "
The bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, such as low oil consumption due to the economic growth crisis and the forecast reduction of oil and gas prices by 20 per cent by 2009.
Second crazy room: team sets record
After having spent the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the uniform of Jets, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw things develop in the second room this Sunday, when the Jets turned a party without notation into a disinflation game.
"I've never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
The second fourth began after the Jets and the Cardinals Arizona had played with pear under the shadows of the clouds.
At this moment it happened that the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranus Coles by achieving a target of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect presage for an afternoon, in which the relationship between the players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the room, one of these when one cornerback fell and another arrived with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," said Favre of all the steps that were going to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, no matter what people may think."
While Favre and Coles were in custody, the Cardinals' defense was being abused by the quarterback Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a moving shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss Warner.
In the last turnover, the flaws forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard beat to win a final 34-0.
It's the bigger points the Jets never made in a room.
To the team coach, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, he said, "The second room or the third room?"
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 points without response in the third room - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second room much more than the third room.
They have won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Gebraselassie Rested Head of World Record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown because many consider her the greatest runner in history, surpassing her own world record in Berlin's marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person able to race 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the acommodating race in wool at 2:03:59, Gebraselassie has destroyed his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has established the world record number 26 in a race of an impressive length so that it has established a world championship or a world record for any distance from the counter-watching race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps in too alarming, in retrospect - that air pollution would exacerbate its problems with asthma.
Instead, he set out to run to Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using in the medium term a few shorts 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory last Sunday, Gebraselassie told reporters that she had been in jail two weeks before and that she had lost a week of training.
Clearly, the suspension left him fresh, unoxidated.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but at the end everything was fine."
The athlete has been subject to some criticisms - especially in Kenya, the afro-oriental rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating too much of his careers, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on the marks as if it were a race track, and putting the records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a runner.
This Sunday, on the march of four Kenyans, Gebraselassie reached half the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after his trades decreased.
But just before three miles of the target, Gebrselassie took a last impulse to separate from Kwambai, who ended up second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi arrived in the third place at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, native to Kazakhstan, but now German citizen, completed a notable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain has the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and establish her best record staff in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculation career, leaving a quarter of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to make head and then recover them after 18 1‚ÅÑ2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and proof of color life
Hidden from the expansion of the park on the topic of the Great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and collusive city, there is a quiet town, where pride and complications of African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first completely inhabited by blacks embedded in the country and place of the child of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guayabs, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described ‚Äì also making it a tourist stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers' Project of the Depression season ‚Äì remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the years ‚Äò30, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and doesn't know what's going on."
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to starting a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the outside world.
"We are very careful about how our history is told," said Jones Hortense, 59 years old, a resident of all life and a member of the oldest church in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a triumph and struggle paradise.
At the same time, it is a historical model of the black people's claim and a community of almost 2,400 people living below a double poverty level of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a restored example of the rural culture of the Black South - sometimes neglected, other praised - who was born of slavery in America.
It's not strange if those who live here are proud and reserved at the same time.
A Y's concern about Eatonville's image really started by Zora, as no one here calls you Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the centre of Florida often forgotten inside the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a concrete face in both life and literature, Ms. Hurston took her readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then inside more private areas.
"Out of the road to the left," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well maintained gardens and playgrounds, care for Howard Miller, as he can only read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of widow Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transient rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston puts into relationship Eatonville with the autonomous government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this F√≥dor didn't do it.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it this way," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the girls Johnson that Mrs. Hurston immortalized quoting men who were singing colourless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as a live eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77 years old, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did it without prior notice in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud to dress with dignity.
Most of the residents were fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while many were sarcastically angry.
"People always rejoiced to see Zora," continues Mr. Franklin.
But she adds, balancing on her chair in a back yard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although he was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the '20s, he was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where he had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no large commemorative ceremonies, no large public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography by Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
The Orange County officials wanted to put a five-carrying road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-carrying street of the working community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Strong integration, inter alia, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mix led to hatred about the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys went around the city pulling oranges and every thing against the people who were sitting next to them," said Mr. Franklin.
"They killed a girl, too, once.
They threw him against a car sandwich."
In a letter from 1955 to Mrs. Hurston, she wrote the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court, which, in Brown v. Board of Education "was insulting rather than honoring my race."
R The residents today say that the desegregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of their young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I agree with this - it used to embrace the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't going to hug your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural gap there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons ‚Äì black writers, actors and artists who went through the prejudices, just as she did, with a drink, trust and lines like: "How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous grave and began to struggle to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, a cheery biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the libraries, reintroducing it into the American cannons.
The road project came just at the time that Eatonville's most famous daughter was again under the reflectors.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the opening event two years later, and every January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its proposal for a road.
"The excited idea of the five-way road would have been to put what you would call a bending speed, a true civic pride," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the same city.
People from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to church from here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and the residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new library (with Hurston's name, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a refurbished and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando can sometimes feel like a street in the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
The foreigners who come looking for Eatonville's history, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
An early permission is necessary to do most of the interviews, and some things - like the walls in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has a weakness for the bright red, still fears that her island community may be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, there has also been a higher level of birth pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the same way that Mrs Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, worker, dumb and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's 18-year-old nephew Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old winter park twins, seem to have learned how to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, if they dare to go here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at your history, it's a very nice city."
This way, in New York, everyone is talking about finances.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and giant television screens in Times Square, they would not be aware of being in the eyes of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass fa√ßade of the bee-rooms above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers that monopolies New York face daily the worst "bad day of the office" since 1929.
Boys for the delivery to home continue to resonate their metal carts for tea through the steels and carry muffin flags for breakfast meetings.
Latin men continue to drag between buildings of loaded apartments, as well as human mules, with 50 eccentric printing shirts hanging to a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in queue for their food to be taken from the morning, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the evening on working days.
Employees are still waiting to pick up their luggage at the seller's carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon in the days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic predictions that exist, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time necessary for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of more than 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw your cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer's service bank, where customers all the time order their check-in talents, tourists are looking for instructions to go to Macy's big stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "personal trust banker", and they were in charge for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places where they had been switched, places such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the State Island.
They had taken their money out of so-called savings associations (a little like a construction company), credit unions and savings boxes in their home city, whose whites only work within the state of ownership, and that they said to treat customers as their family.
During the past year, 15 of these banks have failed silently.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went into bankruptcy, and as the New Yorkers went to their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with a savings deposit of $440 billion, was looking for a ransom buyer.
The workers of the offices and shops that stood before me, fearing another collapse, were transferring their money to a bank, which is considered a safe refuge, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Regular persons in New York have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her executive director, Dick Full, was concerned about the matter with familiarity as if they were complaining about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, 50 and something in uniform from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping at the tender.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "now I have all my savings in funds of the monetary market.
Switching is done, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim graves profaned at the time when Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the extreme right party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgian, affiliated to the extreme right party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities Against Islamization" in Amberes on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs that represent the mixes with a red line that passes through.
The police are blaming extreme right-wing extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that political parties in the right-wing extreme made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged in Traun cemetery, near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, in which the police believe it was an organized action.
The criminals have carved Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David over some of the graves, but researchers believe this may have happened in an attempt to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of profanation, which came to Muslim religious people when Ramadan was about to end.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for an introspection round after the turn to the right in parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two extreme-right parties, which met almost 30 per cent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on the anti-immigration campaign and some of its slogans were considered xenophobias by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against the heads and burkas, and also expressed his opposition to the foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prohibit the construction of mosques and mines, arguing that they were symbols of the current Islamic policy in Austria and Europe.
Investigations and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Prohibition of travel abroad for Gary Glitter
The courts have forbidden Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, to travel to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the supervisory authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent ' s police formulated a ban on travelling abroad last Thursday after the judges had produced the evidence of the previous Glitter convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, a real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing in the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by counsel Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Judicial Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September, at Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad like him to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad by meeting under the registration of sexual offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to notify the police of the scheduled date with seven days in advance of their exit.
Kent's police said that they wouldn't discuss the individual case or the possible place to stop Glitter in the county.
One Kent Police spokesman said, "Kent Police will do all they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
One Kent Police spokesman said, "Kent Police will do all they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to watch someone who stays in the UK because we have the systems here to manage all possible risks in a more effective way.
"Protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the main concern of the Kent police and we work in close collaboration to monitor the behaviour of sexual offenders registered in the county and minimize any risks that may exist for the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and eventually returned to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied his entry and he fled back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 by possession of images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of Interior reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, calmed down and rejoiced to know that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"Capt to the teacher outside the scene to extract his character" G√ºnther Bauer_Photographer
You don't even wear tights, you don't wear tights, you don't even wear tights.
The essence of the great teachers of the flamenco, stripped of the concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
The artist on one side.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in the privacy, at such times outside the public, when you find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressity of a hand, neglected because they are not going to go out to the scene.
German G√ºnther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" theatricality of some staged with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of the flamenco from different areas.
Included in the programme of the Flamenca Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of the flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who explains that "Flamenco-people" "can be people anyone but, when seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These "on the street" portraits are artists capable of conveying on stage passion, sorrow, joy... protecting the public.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos from the scene.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to grasp with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With the taste of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer started a long trip in 1,997 to portray the singers, guitarists or dancers with a boardroom.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, remember classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classic base of the image, confirming its modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands the flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the action of the dance, the song or the touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that protects with his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with the essential, with the dude that is made visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the El Fotomata gallery.
Known figures of the flamenco like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seventy photographers.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits shown in the sample.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Veteran Sports Portraits" ("SportARTProject").
Although concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to enter a moment in their lives, whether a long or short moment.
I think that in photography the portrait is the most difficult gender.
You find yourself or face people, characters, that sometimes you don't know, or that leave you just a few minutes to be able to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people", is shown in the El Fotomata Gallery, located on the 20th of the street of Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where it can be visited until the next 16th of October.
Vargas Llossa admits that the novel she writes is "a fear"
It is located in places that do not yet know and verse about unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Llossa is committed to moving forward the new project in which he works, a novel that has as a protagonist to Roger Casamant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite of the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival that the project that today deals with "is a terror" and that "all indicates that you shouldn't write" the novel.
"If it were sensible, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I'm hoping to finish it sometime," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he'd seen pass through the city of the Acueducto to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the outstanding figures of the third edition of the festival of the word and fulfilled the prophecies.
Vargas Llossa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an ancient edition of "Our mutual friend", by Dickens-, filled out the opening of the theater Juan Bravo.
Presented by F√©lix Romeo, he found himself a public who was given very short the time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with large doses of humor, reviewed how he was born in him his literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "placer to read" and "live more than what he lived"; how he wrote of "disciplined manner" to fill his "inspiration flaw" with an intense documentation work, correcting and repeating much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which their stories support.
Hispano-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if the books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llossa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more inconsistencies", so he asked the writers "do not leave the frivolity" and "take responsibility" his vocation.
Climate change the Pozoblanco fair that also remains unrestricted
The regional festival that closed the holiday season in Pozoblanco was suspended in the morning of yesterday, after checking the announced joiners that the square floor was not in the best condition.
In this way, the company, according to Ferm√≠n Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern√°ndez, decided to suspend the race celebration.
Meteorological inclusions have been celebrated with this fair, as at last two of its three festivals have not been able to celebrate.
The Saturday was the rain that prevented the second scheduled bull race.
The poster was composed by Jos√© Luis Moreno, Curro D√≠az and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a castle in Castilblanco
So, only Friday was a party.
In him, the triumph was Daniel Luke who cut three ears and went out to his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That very evening, Alejandro Talavante left his two bets with greetings and an ear, which gave more tendons than his tore.
That is, worse still was July, which went through the things of the Llanos without pain or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief wave, the bronze of a large part of the public was won.
They jump a control in √Ålava on a van with two thousand kilos of hachis
Five less than ten in the morning.
Traffic control of Ertzaintza in the municipal term of Armin√≥n (Alava).
Agents give up on the two occupants of a van and they take the flight.
His load, more than two tons of crochet, was not like to stop.
The officers pursued and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A. J., as reported in a communication to the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several Alava Traffic Unit officials carried out a transport check in the N-1, in step by the municipal term of Armin√≥n.
They were available to stop a van for their inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, rushed abruptly and the control was skipped.
The agents started their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of miles later in the arcne, when their two occupants appeared to flee to the race through a forested area.
The Ertzains finally reached one of them and seized the 2.178 kilograms of crochet they carried and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hooks, so they moved to police units for a thorough and heavy drug inspection.
In addition, the officers found that the registration had been "doubled" since it did not coincide with the collection in the van documentation, so the arrested had also been charged with a falsification of public document.
Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to conduct the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape the race as mentioned, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The detainee, A.A. J. of 28 years old, was transferred to police units to conduct the relevant proceedings and will be available to the court within the next few hours.
Stop Heather Locklear's actress for driving under the effects of any medicine
The actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medicine.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers trying to get out of her parking in Montecito, according to the People magazine, a spokesman for the California road patrol.
The witness has detailed that in 16.30 hours, Locklear "was climbing down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car from the parking forward and back, and going back several times over their sunglasses".
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently had not initially recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"He seemed disoriented," so the agents took him to the drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed himself cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded since the first time, although "as the officers observed it at first sight, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medicine".
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of some substance that had not been specified and entered the local prison over 7 p.m. although he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left a treatment clinic in Arizona where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Callers urge the Andalusian U.S. Federation to assume its powers in the Silva case
The U.S. Secretary-General and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, today assured that it would be the regional federation of training that should take a decision on the case of the former civil society council and sports council, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of dealing in favor of families.
"I am a very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its powers," Llamazars said about the party's action to adopt with which he has so far conceded in the Seville Consistency.
However, the U.S. leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva could have done: "U.S. has always defended that this kind of matter has the highest degree of transparency."
In the same line, he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public tasks".
'May Blood', Garci's epic bet
Inspiring at the National Episodes of Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s, Jos√© Luis Garci relives the famous rise of the Spaniards against the French in Sangre de May, which is the most ambitious film in his film with about 15 million euros in the budget.
Thus, the filmmaker has tried "to illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Guti√©rrez and Paula Echevarr√≠a in front of a wide list of interpreters.
The blood of May, with a meter above two and a half hours, is stretched this Friday in the cinema rooms, to become a mining for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
Great admirer of Gald√≥s' literature, Jos√© Luis Garci assures us that he has fulfilled this round "a child's dream", which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Madrid Community has been entrusted with a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2, which he accepted at all times and when the report was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budgets that the Community of Madrid has made in its entirety constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to environment with the decorations and the appropriate clothing the portrait of "an atolled Spain which was wrong as a chief to fight, because the struggle for independence has led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having counted on a funding such as that of Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice that of the Blood of May - so he has not been able to round some scenes in a script signed by Horacio Valƒçarcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost all his career.
For this reason, the Director of Back to Start, has reflected on what his usual form of work is, the stage with the actors, with which he usually tries before starting the round and those who don't casting, in his opinion "humilant" and consider that "part of the director's office stays at the theater and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters with whom he coincides in the blood of May repeat to his camera, such as the case of Miguel Rell√°n, Carlos Larran√±aga or Fernando Guillinn Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar on four occasions - from which he won one - Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year in front of the Hollywood Academy, the very Blood of May, the Seven French billing tables and the finally selected, the blind sunglasses, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "that is the one to be introduced to," he said.
With this movie Garci doesn't expect prizes.
"In the beginning you think you're working for the post-story, then you realize that you're only working for the prosperity, and now you're conforming to making a movie more," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bay√≥n recovers the essence of the sevillana ballarina Tortola Valencia
A sevillane dancer will honor a sevillane dancer as well.
Carmen T√≥rtola Valencia, a father of Catalan (Floren√ß T√≥rtola Ferrer) and mother of Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and when she was three years old moved to London with her family.
He was a free dance dancer and a specialist in Oriental dances.
He had a passionate life, a pioneer of the liberation of women, such as Isador Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the race that prevented the women's free movement.
The life of this woman, who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe of war, fascinated Isabel Bay√≥n.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to count their lives but to gather their spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested to me flamenco balls.
So, "the dance of the turtle" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," he says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one of his shows, just as he did at the "Open Door"; and with Maestro Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with who his student was.
"Matilde makes Tortola great, the character of matureness.
I am happy because I have accepted to act in my work and I feel very honored for that."
The assembly also includes the musical composition and guitars of Jes√∫s Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Mor√≥n; the percussion of El P√°jaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Ju√°rez, "who makes the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were divine in all their extension, and who always walk in love with them".
The work also includes in some ways the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time being, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind you because I think it's about these women who have a huge influence on a certain time and now no one knows and much less values their work," said Bay√≥n.
The show will begin today at 20.30 a.m. at the Lope theatre in Vega.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Trienio
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Recessed Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez married Zenobia in March 1916, is marked within the activities programmed by the Andalucia Board of Culture Council to celebrate the "Trinio Zenobia and Juan Ram√≥n" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Literature Prize and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ram√≥n" comes to an end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of Nobel and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez: That time of light", which was opened last May and which, after travelling through the various Andalusian provinces, will be planned to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
The Andalucia Board of Culture Council has also acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Reincarnated Poet's Diary", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo P√©rez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Auscence of Malicia", and gives the idea of the disparagement of American cinema, and of all America, in view of the impressive idea that Newman has gone.
Look, it cost them an Oscar.
And it's been withdrawn since 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
It's still been a puzzle for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
No one was afraid to make a joke or exaggerate.
He had died a father of cinema and homeland at a particularly dark time, with fear of terrorists and the markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When it's so hard time and powerless men and very few beings that admire you, there's no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
I was incarnating for all an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and gained causes, from the foundation to fight the drugs created in honor of his firstborn dead by overdoses to his brand of home and organic food.
All a gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of the admirer would be Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that he didn't kill a man but an era.
Another Englishman, the oscarized director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing less than the top of his career.
The bad guy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left us a very high list for all," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to try to live as Paul Newman lived: holding high the requirement of probability and having a serious private life and away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who is trying, and Paul Newman is his example.
She was divorced once but then married for 50 years with Joanne Woodward, whom she was faithful when she was probably overwhelmed by opportunities not to be.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger out of the house, if I have a file inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he sees the pride that his daughters in the earth match with their fans, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he interpreted, of none was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, single grandfather and dedicated philanthropy," they say.
The imperfect career of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that there are some Olympics in Madrid and, after the failure of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race called it, and in my judgment it was the worst race I've ever been in.
A colloquium of dispropositives that would, from then on, if they took it into account as an evaluation and I would consider it would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go for part and from the beginning.
Disposals begin with the collection of the back, which makes you have to go first.
Which doesn't look bad to me, but if they're already making you go, they give it all up (including the chip to avoid glues in the race).
Not at all.
Here they just made you go to pick up your back (first disposit, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only 'S' size for the shirt (second disposit, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Or is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy only small shirts with less fabric and cheaper?
Well, things like that are a minivan compared to those of the day of the race.
Besides having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the queue when you arrive is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
It took more than 35 minutes to wait, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as it was to wait, it started the race and we had not yet left the backpack, even though once it was achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was joined by popular rebellion and assaulted by the caste.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they won't even appear with the right time in the classification, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, didn't mark my exit correctly.
Since then, if they asked me about the perfect race, this one wouldn't come into my mind.
So I think we'll keep dreaming with a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search recipient (virtual)
In the conference on Emergency Technologies of MIT Microsoft has shown an advance of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence without much intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move around the company's campus) by listening to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a facial recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are doing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the audiences according to the discussion groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group he's talking to and that he's not a company employee.
Ask him if he's there to visit someone and tell him he'll be there soon.
Everything without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of your operating system, Windows.
This week a lot has been talked about above a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers came with the essentials instead of commercial garbage shipments, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it's already going to be for less.
All a find taking into account that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is grateful.
Microsfoot is right, the operating system is losing importance, as well as software.
When Google Chrome went out to the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many have made it clear that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the hardware and software to be understood.
Do the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but we must think of the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute, but relative truth.
What Ballmer has said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People increasingly pay less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer only starts to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half of the applications that come on the system for?
It's less than that.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and ultimately being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a little example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft's employees' rest rooms in Redmond in the beginning of the month.
In the refreshing machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by default, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather by 2010.
In Microsoft you will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is every day more computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, is going to pass the bill.
Le Fabulux Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Capri lit a 'Diamante de blood' by Edward Zwick, the same as Al Pacino in 'El Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the uniform of the muscled gay parish.
And if we put ourselves in a number of stellar appearances, we can go up to the image of that punctuated bigot force that lifted weights in a walking circle.
In essence, it is only the typical male shirt in cotton, ash and without sleeves.
The 'tank', which call the speaking angels, but the Fabulux Marcel de Bruxelles gives way to everyone else.
First, because of its reputation - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with sport because it receives its name, according to legend, from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'The Marcel' highlights on the others by his excellent cotton, by his unisex cut, by his distinctive shield and by the small Belgian flag (recognizable only) that the most emblematic shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
Also includes college sweatshirts, back boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Take thought for comfort underwear.
Although it's a shame to leave them as inner clothing.
They're too cute.
"I want to be a young mom; I don't care about the candidate"
His enormous likeness with his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is often but full of vitality.
The sisters of Cruz are now taking their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who give their name.
It has been in Paris in the promotion that the Mango firm does at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion prizes that the Spanish house sponsors.
Hot and shy, win in short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Pen√©lope and I have invented for Mango in this new autumn and winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the opera dinner in honour of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day, but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
My sister and I both love the movie of the 1950s and 1960s; from there we draw many references.
Then, I really like to lose myself for a city and watch women dress up, as they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Ballarina, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything unites and has many ties in common.
From a young age, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to pee in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, as a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my dress.
You know, the dancers like to make us style for classes and tests, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the dress is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, that's yes, with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You haven't been through much since the 30s, have you been in crisis?
What's going on?
I feel better than ever, I like 30s.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
To me, the biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you're a mother or not?
Since then, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body asks for it and I also want to be a young mother; this I don't want to lose.
As for the candidate, I don't care.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the movie, you're hanging out with a number of strangers you circled last year.
That's how I want them to see the light.
I, who am a woman coming from the theater, I am very impatient and anxious, all I want for now and of course, can't be.
I want them to stretch out 'The Last Hour' and 'In search of the tomb of Christ'.
Seeing what they look like...
A few days ago you started on a pass with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to be a modeled passerby.
She simply called me Naomi Campbell, to whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a beneficial show for her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we display - I pulled two pieces from our collection for Mango - was trying to raise money for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
They say so many things about her that, I know her, they would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I stay with that part so good that it's involved.
He asked me to dissipate for such a noble cause, but if I came to ask him to make the pin, then so too.
For the benefit of women in the third world, what is needed.
Reconstituted drivers must install the 'alcollock'
Inside the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcoholism, he must install in his vehicle a system that prevents the starting of the Hebrew vehicle, or if he does not tire.
The initiative has already been announced last June and is now included in the annual memory of the Public Prosecutor-General's Office, which says it is a pilot project that will last a year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver, so he will also receive a course of road reeducation.
In the experience, in addition to the Vial Security Office, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for the Safety of Vehicles (FITSA) will participate.
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of the motorists reported more than once driving Hebrews takes the car again.
The alcohol would avoid it as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow up the abs; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than permitted.
Its cost is more than EUR 1,000 and would run on account of the penalty.
In this regard, a study carried out in the EU in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 people every year.
The measure is aimed at administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing these behaviours before they occur in criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done on a regular basis, and however, the necessary reform by criminal law requires a reform of an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial manner, although it has already been experimentally installed on some industrial and public service vehicles.
It is precisely tomorrow that the Congress of Members will vote tomorrow for an initiative by the PSOE which proposes to install this system on school buses, as has been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 5.40 p.m., the time set out in the programme, at the Presidential Hangar of the airport Benito Ju√°rez of Mexico DF landed the Spanish air force aircraft on which the Asturias princes traveled.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced to use the hand as a visa to see the real couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier I had asked the cab driver if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very well, then you can't go to the airport to load that time... she's from here or so...
- No, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who are the Princes of Asturias and the importance of the journey.
Many are waiting for the hangar of the airport stuck to the red carpet and a military valley formed by 27 Marine soldiers who interpret the saving of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the Princess, melena to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had told her that in the DF he threatened storm.
They give a smile and a listening ear to the photographers before going to the room where the official comedy is waiting.
At the hotel door where you stay, one of the four greats in the city, you will find a news reporter from Mexican television.
The Best Fashion Award
There is probably no place in the most appropriate world to present a fashion prize, that Paris and probably no live designer more exquisite and good live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards to enhance the international projection of the new fashion talents.
It is equipped with a prize of EUR 300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs on Mango's escape in the 54th of the Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept of the emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the signature in Europe and it has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one is in London.
So many events, coupled with the desire to thank the designer Valentino to preside over the jury of the ceremony, ended up in a luxury dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With close to the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Nati, with a heart broken and making a heart trip, for his brother's recent death, put on a suit from the House and some ELAH addresses, which cut the breath, and the arm of his son Luis - a cannon nearly two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the chairmanship of his tribute dinner.
Andik, the owner and master of Mango, did the honors and is such a gentleman that he ended up beside the Baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because they had both been lent to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the shop with pants and shirts - self-designed - and for dinner she turned into a black long sexy dress, was excited when on the night walk by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet test room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a mask of 'great plee'.
In√©s Sastre did not stay on the walk through the palace‚Äôs dependencies, but he taught us pictures of his son‚Äôs mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to rejoice at the presence of Olivier Mart√≠nez - another cannon that moves on a motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his soaps, his towels and having previously requested, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-trafficking number
There are no 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frenetic everyday life.
And if not, they're all gathered in a book that will bring relief to the librarians on September 30th.
The awakener almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it's even worse to imagine being wrapped in the agitated rhythm that imposes the present life.
The office is called tension and the back pain computer.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection with the working world.
No, the number goes up to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a book all a 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each one.
The work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone considers that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' is demeaning such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as contacting nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the sofa, disconnect the mind and concentrate on reading.
Sleeping Talk
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up very excited telling us something that's happened the other day, but children who talk are sleeping.
The first time that happens to the best you take a breath, but it doesn't really matter.
It is a benign change in the dream that is called dreamy.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one has been told that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (once in life for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the child remembers nothing the next day.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They often relate to other changes in sleep such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (to sleep on the floor) or sonambulism, but it doesn't have to be that way.
As mentioned earlier, they can also be associated with very high fever patterns, stress situations, or overexit.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
I may speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or everything else (grunts, lightnings, long speeches...).
In cases where the event is very intense, it is appropriate to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check whether there is any question that is causing much anxiety and thus gives him a way out.
We have said that it is a benign change, so it has no treatment, unless you are associated with another change in the dream that can be treated (for example, if you are associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child much before going to sleep.
So find quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that are scary or a little violent.
With very nervous children and which costs them a lot to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will help the child to have a quieter dream.
Once the dreams appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they're harmless to the child and that the next day you won't remember anything about what happened.
Useful Councils
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not conscious, and you'll break his dream.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you show a lot of anxiety during several episodes, you should consult or find out what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what you're saying (which is not the most common), don't fall into the temptation to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because when you're asleep, you're not aware of how to organize your thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what you say, but you do not know what you are dreaming to say that, with which you are very careful about how you interpret the information and the conclusions you come up with.
You never tell the child that you can question him at night to know his secrets.
Don't even joke.
That creates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
They're finally getting used to it!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way of victory in its field after a long period of poverty.
Without a good match, the team created many goals and was able to make a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very constant during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to tear the squad with a shot away, Illhaeusern Quaasi was going to take the "power" and by way of the Fonderflick turn away, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we didn't let the center camper pass, and we only left Riahi in the attack position.
The principle of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of goal of Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illouisians with goal of Marais, well located to collect the balloon rejected in a first attempt of Diebold (53 ").
But swallowing Illouisiens can't enjoy his happiness long and will be forced to return to the guards a dozen minutes later and leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven illusians who went back a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after an important farlful, the balloon passed very close to the transversal field.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before departing to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will run around Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance by fishermen who were deeply disturbed last Monday by the entries from several British and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finist√®re last Tuesday to meet his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " with a constructive spirit " and hope that " he will come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general board of the " crisis committee " established by the British fishermen in order to achieve measures against the increase in gas oil prices, which marks a record when reaching EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the spokesman for El√≠s√©e David Martinon, the president " will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses to be competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors " .
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand firm.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to mitigate the movement in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have resulted in seizures of almost 10 km.
Quiberon's sports port has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-√éle have not been stopped.
"A filter barrier" has been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors had already shown their determination on Monday by burning the alba, pneumatics and wooden pallets in front of the fuel warehouses of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the boats remained in the port, or in Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loira-Atl√°ntic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Donges total refinery.
Boulogne-sur-Mer fishermen decided to wait until this Wednesday's meeting will take place in the ministry to think about any action.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officers of the national fishing committee, which did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " fishermen did not leave " and " do not want to move to Paris " , for example, announced Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on petrol, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance of a ship can be reached only with a diesel with a price of less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two men and a destiny " has died of cancer at 83 years of age at home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains his delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian airline company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession in the world economy.
The fourth global aircraft builder, Embraer, maintains his delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 delivery devices, confirmed Embraer's president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half, the company delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian builder is very confident in the Chinese market especially to sell the planes that go from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would want to sell more than 15 % of its assets
The American International Group, which has been taken out of stock thanks to US monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15 per cent of its assets in order to repay its loan of $85 billion, according to the edition of the Financial Times Sunday.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and its retirement insurance in the United States, which is specified in this journal.
The AIG Management Board met last Sunday afternoon to review any sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG is intended to be separated include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer, as well as its portfolio and its investments in private equity, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times continues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay its loan of 85 billion granted by the Federal Reserve to it to see the US authorities take 80 % of its capital, diluting it with the proper proportion of the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives had rejected the Paulson plan to save banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a loss seen in the Stock Exchange of almost 800 points, and Nasdaq lost 9.14%.
The industrial index Dow Jones fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, or the day when the exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, a technologically dominant, returned to 1.9.61 points to 1.993.73 units and the enlarging index (extended) Standard & Poor's 500 to 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1.106.55 units, according to the final figures of the closure.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street drowned after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save banks that would have allowed to recover a little stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied the media that I was asking for the Secretary of the EU Treasury Henry Paulson.
About two Republicans of each three rejected their plan.
"That is not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of the FTN Financial.
"This shows to what point the market was dealing with this plan," Lindsey Piegza added, fearing that a project adopted within several days would come "too late".
"If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take the lead (the U.S. Central Bank, the N. of the Network) in managing the crisis, which would make credit conditions more urgent," warned Brian Bethune, Head of Economics and Finance of the Global Insight.
And by accentuating the sense of urgency, " every day that passes is announced the fall of a financial institution " in the United States, Mrs. Piegza stressed.
After the failure of Washington Mutual last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its Citigroup rival.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, resulting in emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing "not only a crisis in the US but a global crisis", the analyst of the Financial NFN added.
The bond market went up dramatically.
The 10-year-old treasury bond yield was 3,632 per cent, against 3,827 per cent on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bonus was 4,161 per cent, against 4,357 per cent on Monday.
Obama, winner during the first television duel
At the first Friday discussion between the two candidates in the White House, another happened to know who won between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
No surprise, the general quarters of the Republican and Democratic campaign proclaimed their own victory on this television duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "bright enough" to allow him to stop his low in the polls for five weeks of presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday, grants five points of advantage for Obama (49 per cent against 44 per cent for McCain), judges that it is the democracy who went well.
Among the undecided voters, who count, Obama won 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them won McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his own candidate, Jos√© Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He's got good instincts, but I'm preventing Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain highlighted his unquestionable experience in foreign policy, stressing the "ineguity" of his opponent on these issues that were in the heart of this first concern.
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he also assured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in the Republican TV advertisements.
Obama stressed that it represented the future.
Without a doubt, it became clear and accurate.
It highlighted its ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so, " this weekend, a democratic television advertising that reproached the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on the United States " .
" During the nine minutes of discussion, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, said Obama yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a rainy rain.
He did not pronounce the words "media class" or "workers". "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most capable of saving the economy that is at the edge of the rush.
"The next week could be a decisive episode," I loved, yesterday, the influential and democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's " good economic instincts " to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the final consequence of eight years of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain " .
Reaffirming that it would come despite the reduction of taxes of 95 per cent of Americans despite Wall Street's surpluses, the Illinois senator also noted that the realization of possible energy independence in the country through the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a 45 nuclear power plant park from here in 2030.
Prudentes, the two candidates had distorted the financial saving plan of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents protested last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to anticipate the results of the legislators.
Hundreds of Belarusians met in the afternoon from the closing of the electoral centres in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, he must resign."
Some recognize that they have not voted: "Why, because they will do what they want with my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has put foreign observers in a good position in order to renew contact with the European Union is ready to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean for observers.
They weren't according to the opposition.
" We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the vote count," said Iuri Potemkine, the spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regroup of twelve parties.
" It is a cosmetic change, underlined by Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house is the executive power.
If some members of the opposition join the parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
" But their entry into parliament can mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. "
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts against Russia, is in crisis, and if we don't reform, we are in danger of becoming a Russian protector.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalization of the vote with anticipation (26% of the voters in Minsk) promoted manipulations.
" Have you noticed the elections? Ask the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polls.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition to Parliament, who are better suited to power."
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulated him on his success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Qu√©bec celebrated yesterday its 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Francine Decary, was right to rejoice, because Hema-Qu√©bec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained the public's confidence that he had been seriously paralyzed by the scandal of blood contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and the discontent of the public, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer occur.
While Judge Krever was delaying his relationship, some provinces then set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the G√©lineau Committee carried out this mission.
As a result of the reports of G√©lineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Qu√©bec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Quebec began his activities, almost 38 per cent of the people still trusted in the blood system in Quebec, Decary recalled.
The situation was discouraging.
After much effort has been made to improve the safety of blood products and much work during the years that followed, we have regained the confidence of the public," he said, saying before proudly that at the beginning of 2008, approximately 94 per cent of the Quebec population had the subsequent confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Decary recalls, however, that " confidence is extremely fragile " .
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Qu√©bec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we attended in Europe the birth of many cases of the human variant of the disease of the mad cow, a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Count Decary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of Krever and G√©lineau's reports, according to which when we don't know, and when a serious illness can arise from that, in this case, Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of those who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But a few years ago, it has been shown beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: tests of nucleated acid that enable donors to directly detect the presence of the virus and not of antibodies to the virus, in which the tests used so far were based.
Nuclear acid tests allowed the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We could reduce this period for less than a week.
We thus reduce substantially the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements led to a significant reduction in the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, a person every 12 million is at risk of receiving blood contaminated by HIV.
"This means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected by HIV.
As Hema-Quebec distributes between 400 000 and 50 000 blood products each year, more than 24 years will pass before a case of transmission of HIV through a blood product is resolved.
I think it is possible to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion today to recover health without concern," says Hema-Quebec's head of management.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the R√©union, which, for example, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient supplies before it is emphasized that, in addition to a safe supply, hema-Quebec must be constantly vigilant."
" The needs increase because the population is ageing.
Since more aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often require injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors that, on average, regroup only 3% of Quebeces eligible for blood donation. "
All persons with good health, aged 18 and who meet the eligibility criteria may, however, give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of those who propose their blood are not accepted because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled in a country where malaria rules, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory covering the needs of hospitals.
The pendulums are very rare.
But there is a need to renew the members of this network of donors as they age and can no longer give their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to hold them and to encourage them to be regular donors.
Since the present life is very unbreakable, we rarely find time to spend an hour to give her blood," says Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Qu√©bec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone inerts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that are almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Qu√©bec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered to be biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of mother cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
" We celebrated it a few weeks ago, put it in the bank of our thousandth blood sample of the umbilical cord and is expected to take out more than a thousand of these a year.
We would have to start proposing it for inerts at the beginning of next year," says Dr. D√©cary, who describes this blood supply program as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this, " since Hema-Qu√©bec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact on Semifinals
The Montreal Impact was qualified for the semifinals of the elimination series of the first USL division, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 final summary) victory on the coast of Seattle's Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive party of the series of final rooms, at the Saputo Stadium.
The center champion Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a goal on either side, the center champion David Texto and Rocco Plancentino created many occasions of goal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who broke down Matt Jordan by the Sounders.
Let us remember that during the first party of the series of games to go back and forth, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in Seattle's suburb.
The impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in semifinal.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, Thunder lost 3-1 in the back party to carry it for 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless entered the semifinals for 5-4.
The impact should be faced with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday next, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
Soon ‚Äì The victorious goal of Kovalev
The third number of Canadians is ready to undertake the season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostsyn's compounded the attack in a 3-2 win from the Canadians on the free shot against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the Tricolor room in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory marking the only goal.
"I'm still not ready, I'm preventing the Russian.
"I need another party to feel comfortable."
He tried to play the most in the first time, he noted Guido Carbonneau.
But I think you appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation."
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the holding of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general advice of the Liberal Party ends, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be elected during today's partial election.
Rejecting the limits of our last large northern border ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the general advice of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in L√©vis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric packaging, mining, of Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means such as during the election period.
The Prime Minister thinks that the elections will take place this fall, although he showed that his schedule was very full.
The " North Plan " is the fourth side of a " vision " that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a " new economic space " which includes an agreement on working hand with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, was limited to explaining why the North was " a joy to the immense potential " , but did not give a term, investment amounts, nor a precise priority in future projects.
What could be more developed above all is: particularly hydroelectricity, forest, but above all the mining sector, doubled by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, five, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond " , according to Mr. Charest's number.
This "territory twice as big as France," "is our home, is in Quebec.
It's not just our home, but it's in us," he insisted, as to show that he asked for a national founder myth.
Quebec was built thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the laugh towards gold in Abitib, the Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added, after having made a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always recovered, the prime minister said during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion occurs, I repeat that position on the part of the government " , he indicated.
In addition, "with climate change, we have to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the north-west passage, which will be opened every year due to the landing of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel L√©tourau (former member of the Quebec Party of Ungava), have already started consultations with about one-thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Beno√Æt Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role started some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting in which " a common vision " will be given.
North development would be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concerted, ordered and respected by the environment " , he promised.
Jean Charest described this vision as one that is continuing with that of the first liberal ministers who preceded it.
" Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently of transforming the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring topics of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival to the party's power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to re-establish the Beauharnois Central in Embalse Ad√©lard-Godbout.
" From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the revolution quiet and nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Burassa that made the Bay of James our party supposed to build the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he called on another reference, that conservative, John Diefenbaker's program "Roads to the North", prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the topic of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric embalming project, Mr. Charest stressed that his deployment was scheduled for 2012.
"This is between us, but I'm going to be there," he confided to his militants, raising applause.
In fact, the first minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not reject the possibility of putting in place a vote this fall, which the law allows.
She stressed that her schedule was still full, particularly because of a federal council mission in China and a summit in Quebec-New York York.
The General Council at the end of the week provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problems accepting: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular called for recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to name members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcome the great lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Quebec Party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Qu√©bec North Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, reaching power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If I had done so, "we would have made progress today," said Mrs. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (voting today), Fran√ßoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what you wish, is that this is not just a show," said the leader Sebastian Proulx, in replacement of Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonest Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (Ironia!) in Harper's office, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "revenge" for Canada.
Disgrace this woman who has carried out an incessant fight for justice and deserves all our admiration for what she says about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are faced with a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, who has not repatriated its national who is locked in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that he was recruited happened.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, refuses its promise and lets a child-soldier live in inhuman conditions.
The only one who has a false justice to assess the accused's guilt.
We recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to benefit from an equitable process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it doesn't care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of extinction.
We still do not realize that, but we are seeing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that doesn't make sense.
The time has come when no more morals exist: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprisonment a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far as he wants to (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtud, the Law and the Order: it does not see that this government has given up what was the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews' shame is caused by this resignation and by nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian discourse
In its issue of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President and Director of the Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest aurifer company in the world has attempted a six-million-euro process against three authors and a small editorial house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecution for defamation, but the law.
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the dispute is of little importance, the authors and editor of the book Noir Canada should spend considerable amounts in order to prepare their defense and fight, with very uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless mines.
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, often consist of tearing down the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will stifle the opposition as well as scare anyone to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in a number of countries where Barrick Gold is working, discussions in Canada are usually made by changing ideas and not by beatings.
It was enough for the mine to open its books, its files and establish a real debate through newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public opinion and reject requests and support letters for the authors of Black Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can ask for a "public" debate, disregarding his views?
According to the vice-president, this word seems to designate only highly-paid lawyers, not for all Canadians; it represents a very limited view of the concept.
Detractors also have the right to speak in democracy.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - is that the audience that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does it mainly because it rejects the brutal way of the mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but having as a basis civilized change of arguments, and not in the context of what many people perceive as a persecution-mortality (following the "public debate " , Barrick Gold has just filed a requirement regarding the authors of Noir Canada urging them to no longer use this word).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university and truth, essential by all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the basis for intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that dishonor this world‚Äôs rich companies in a country like Canada, under the guise of many persecutions, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long been known to manage debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's relentless persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he wants, he does not want to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for Governments to place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, at the same time Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic saving plan since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan that aims to halt the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by the electors of their implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the invested public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses charged with the lack of payment, as well as a right to control salaries paid to the managers of the companies in question.
The American Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
" We have made great progress with a view to an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
" Everything has been done to cover the regular economy and Americans in the face of the current Wall Street crisis," the Democrat explained.
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, trauma, chaos and disturbances on the daily lives of Americans will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they were afraid of the effect that would lead to a new failure in investor mood.
The last set time was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the US presidential elections, who have joined the negotiations late, were more favourable to the agreement, but did not forget to express their discontent about being forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has been entrusted with certain provisions for reaching the agreement, in particular which would enable owners to retain their home and the salary of the heads of the State's surviving companies.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, asked in another string to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, said: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
"The important points I have read [show] that is something we will have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
He said that the option of not doing anything is not acceptable."
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with the taxpayers' money the dubious debt, the risk assets and indemnity assets of the US financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the emergence of a real estate bubble that first led to the sinking of risk mortgages before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (CCAA) and causing a freeze of liquidity and a discharge from banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans that had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have left the stagnation since the Democrats agreed that certain "toxic" assets of the companies in difficulty are only secured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the aim of eliminating expectations for everyone at Congress, we also added a provision that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which 100 billion other million can be added if the President seems to be in need.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by the Congress.
In exchange for your help, Washington will receive participation in the assisted companies that will split it up in case of profits and that it will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the procedures for embargoes concerning housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and compensation paid to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives since today and the Senate's next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is still not sure that his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest against this project yesterday, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the chamber finance commission, told his electors that "with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand."
" We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But it's not what it's about to take advantage of the taxpayers."
The Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is encouraging to a small group in Congress, presents the problems in a different way, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote us to say: we ask Congress not to hurry and carefully examine the path to take," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had refused to buy its bankruptcy competitor since it lost EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) during the risk capital crisis.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty-largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money, said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
Instead, we regain a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is just something that the saviors and the families will now appreciate that the times are uncertain."
During this time, on the other hand, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would be responsible for all outstanding loans in the Bradford and Bringley bank and more than EUR 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander said yesterday that it would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
Did the American actor with a charming smile ever get rid of her narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
Their laughter, their sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have removed him from the register of power that have the true sacred monsters.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at 83 years of age, because of lung cancer in his Connecticut range, remains one of the last icons of American cinema from the years to now.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, who seemed much and was long considered a rival in the cinema, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the emergence of dramatic conventions.
Mixed bloods often make magnificent children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
Of these European roots one of the glorious faces of American dream will be born.
No unscrupulous ego, last quality brand.
Because in it was projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, wounded in battle, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio of New York, before triumphing in the theater, television and soon in the cinema.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the car driver who was classified in second place in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a six symbol, although a model couple member formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star also disappear with him, allergic to the scandals of the world of the show that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman caused the vertigo to the filmmakers this weekend, while their big roles in the black screen of the memories were intertwined.
More than a half-century American art in perpetual shift shows through it.
Many memories return to memory like the cowboy with the charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Cata on the adapted zinc roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we call on your sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone to the history of the movie.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, a criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable at Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This nice mangan in the funny film The Sting (El Ballpe), Oscar to the best film in 1973.
A bitter and revenged ball player in the magnificent film The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), will repeat the character in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, who valued his only Oscar among nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes with the years, it was him.
It's still him.
The times change during your career.
Young people are especially familiar with this thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a little orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 at the Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a last role as patron of the Irish mafia in the Road to Loss of Sam Mendes in 2003, the rice was dried up.
Unlike a number of movie legends that left the race quite soon, Newman stayed much in the movie world, denouncing Hollywood, his gold, his fastings and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge that lives in "underplaying " and that judges its too-supported benefits.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he less often interpreted the role of young galan than marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, cabrons or desperate ones, whose features reflected the rebellions.
As a performer, Newman revealed his true pudic sensitivity to the unknown.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the main role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdose dedicated his film to Harry and Son in 1984, a work of laughter and sadness.
" Among the many tributes that were triggered yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (they had worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very sad: "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the fallen actor.
On the other hand, his career of legend also conceals a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protest against Hollywood's excess.
We'll have seen a lot of his face reign over the barrels of vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, though it started as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to your Childhood Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than being satisfied with his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: " always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
In summary, a model citizen.
What did they produce in the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the criminal proceedings against J√°nos Zuschlag and his colleagues will be initiated.
The political and their partners are accused of committing significant harm, in a business manner, continuously and in an organized manner, in addition to other crimes, including falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, funds obtained in public tenders were used for their own purposes, justifying, on many occasions, the performance of tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and the town councils - as a whole, some 65 million HUF - stopped partly in the treasury of the Fiatal Balldal organization and partly in the pocket of individuals.
The method, which was also made known by researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices that had no real implementation, the different associations never complied with their commitments assumed.
According to the charge, most invoices were false.
For this they obtained the talent in the market of the District of Jozsefv√°ros and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kisunhallas.
And the question of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made on behalf of was decided amongst others on that tour by the Upper Balaton Region where J√°nos Zuschlag sent to Istv√°n Sides.
The latter admitted that for this purpose he should choose hostels and restaurants.
He requested invoices for his consumption and they served as a model to make the invoices presented to each other in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the Capital Town Hall.
These invoices were signed in most of them by Istv√°n Sides and his associate Andr√°s √ïri, who, according to our information, rather wrote the reports needed to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his "student trips" Sides chose a beer shop.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his colleagues, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyes√ºlet Association.
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people do not belong in that place at the same time.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb J√∂v‚Äê√©rt Foundation - later called Egy√ºtt to Harmadik √âvesred√©rt - was filled with formal and contextual errors.
As a hostel in Badacsonytoja had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, yet in the bill there were a hundred and thirty people.
But manufacturers of large-scale invoices also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. because in the possession of books of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor - there were no documents named Jobb J√∂v‚Äê√©rt and Hopp√°.
The company's manager, Gyhazz-Farkas, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor and showed him the invoices, he knew it was false documents.
"In the seal our company's name and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that, according to the bill, there were hundreds of people, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people are included.
In addition, the invoice also included food, while the restaurant has not worked for a long time.
Enthusiastic invoice manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency elected in Budapest organizes trips exclusively abroad, so that in cash payment invoices they reported in vain as a service a trip within Hungary, which did not coincide with the agency's billing practice.
In addition, as was known during the investigation, VAT was included in the document, although travel outside the territory of the European Union was tax-free.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel R√©vf√ºl√∂p Kft. for the Job J√∂v‚Äê√©rt Foundation, since the services of the company are not loaded with 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, and the hotel employees only extended invoices made to the machine, however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "shippers" made other errors as well, as in the case of a company in which they put on the bill as a road transport activity to which - assumed during the investigation of the tax - the company is not carrying out the company established as an investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp is assumed to be false the invoices sent to Egy√ºtt to Harmadi √âvezred√©rt Alap√≠tv√°ny, to XXI. Sz√°zadi Culturalis Egyes√ºlet and to Biztos Pont.
Just as in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the K√ºnfehert Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue such invoices.
The falsifiers also paid no attention to the fact that when the Fiatal V√°ros√©rt Egyes√ºlet's group ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Ny√≠regyh√°za was in liquidation process, which is why the liquidator - according to our information - refused to issue such a document.
They conscientiously issued the invoices
Another group of fake invoice manufacturers is made up of those who were aware that they should issue fictional invoices.
The Foundation Es√©ly Budapest Alap√≠tv√°ny, at the request of Fiatal Balldal - Ifju Socialist√°k, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Foundation Egy√ºtt in Harmadik √âvezred√©rt.
The manager of the Kft Colllab. - According to the charge, one of the accused, Ludovic Gy√∂rfi, persuaded him to send fictional invoices.
Similarly, he collaborated with Zuschlag and his associates the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 provided invoices of approximately five million HUF to the Job J√∂v ≈Ωert Alapitv√°ny Foundation, the Atlasz Egyes√ºlet Association and the V√∂r√∂sfenny √ògyes√ºlet Association, without real economic activity behind.
There was no movement of capital either, as they then cancelled the invoices prepared but forgot to make a statement in their documents to this entity.
The following group of false invoice manufacturers includes those who have some connection with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the defendant of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with a fictitious headquarters in Budapest, dealing with the trade of fuels and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices for a value of approximately 18 million HUF in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the research data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kisunhalas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also issued the company-related documents between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that issued invoices on behalf of the company for the Atlas, for the Hoppa and for Egy√ºtt to Harmadik √âvezred√©rt Alapitv√°ny collecting the amount itself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian Albanians at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because - according to the accused - they did not get a job.
But he took advantage of these companies, as at the request of his colleague, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the Zuschlag-related organizations: for the Atlas and for the Y-Generation.
Kubatov on behalf of the Cash Investment, the Delta Tri√≥, the Fa-Bani Jos, the Jos Investment and the Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor considered Kubatov to receive VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
This man even took advantage of Szi-Beri's command society to send fictional invoices used in the Biztos Pont competition.
The Y-Generation and S√∂vets√©g in Modern Magyarorsz√°gert presented a competition in January 2006 at Tancsics Mihaly Alap√≠tv√°ny (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively from the tender, but they did not use the money for the objectives of the tender.
To prevent this from being discovered, they presented to the TMA five fictional invoices received from the Kft Works Team.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office held by Arp√°d Kemecsei at the head of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will probably report in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor's Office - the course of falsification of invoices.
The most interesting may be the confession of the chief accused J√°nos Zuschlag himself, if he decides to disarm everything.
As his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so far.
The question is: What interest is it to do so? Because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - 50 million HUF - the socialists have reached an agreement with him to make Zusi assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could be offended, since in order to relieve his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but he was repeatedly denied.
While many authors of very high-value economic crimes, who have never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home, he does not have the opportunity to do so.
Psychology of Overlays: Why do we spend more money?
The participants in the auctions are willing to spend more money and overestimate the product.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York discovered the neurological - economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to the study published in Science magazine, people don't want to lose their skills like eBay's heels, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists have tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental substations.
One of the volunteer groups played the lottery, the other participated in a sub-accumulation and as long as it was examined through the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI) the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games the participants could earn money, but during the auctions, where it is essential to bet more than the other, by losing the game, the operation of the complex called strata located below the brain cortex was intensified.
This brain area, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "auto premium" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention not to cause an intense reaction to the strata.
In order to justify their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups objected to one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members were betting.
In addition, another group was promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly 15 dollars before the auction, but in the event of the auction loss, the members of the group lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, checking the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the group playing "against failure" were willing to bet even more than members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be deducted from any previously existing economic theory.
As those so far explained the phenomena of the auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that we now come to a third explanation" - established Andrew Schutter, professor of the University of New York Economics.
Hepatitis: When should you go to a doctor?
In the world some 50 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of people infected in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by the virus.
Symptoms appear to be very much; they are characteristic of liver and liver infection, but their pathogens and diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogen agent, are spread through two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body humour (sperm, vaginal humour, salt).
It is recommended for travellers to be protected by a vaccine against virus A and B, against C no vaccines.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, it is manifested by a bad general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this appear in the skin and in the white of the eyes, it becomes clear, dark urine and healing can last even for two or three weeks.
Each year a million people die from cancer in the world and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only one in 10 people is treated pharmacologically.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys the liver cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Therefore, early recognition, systematic medical control is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can also be detected with routine laboratory control, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease has healing if it is detected in time, it is possible to eliminate the virus from the body, thereby eliminating the infection and preventing cancer.
On 30 September, it was the World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by the organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and to the importance of their early recognition.
Does he feel less sorry for those who believe in God?
According to a recent study, religious faith has a calming effect that also facilitated the death of martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed how religious belief affects human pain - reported the British Telegraph newspaper.
In the context of this unique experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and to the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the scan technique of the human brain, it was verified that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the various departments of the University also participate.
The analysis took place the following way; they set up a chisping instrument on the left hand of the patient, which applied the electrical shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to set their eyes on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the Lady of the arm of Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers had hoped that the Virgin Mary's show would produce a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while choosing Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a calming effect.
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electrical shocks in four successive parts during that period while observing the painting of religious subjects or the other.
The Catholics said that as they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected people", "they were calmed and in their hearts peace reigned."
In observing the religious theme, they felt 12 per cent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such impressive image you can achieve a similar effect with the atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person who feels very positive, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really change our personality" - added Wright.
After these formidable results, there is one question: What effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the Faithful Lady of Leonardo or another painter of her size were shown to the faithful?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary throw even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
In its tenth birthday, Google can claim: it can be found both in the people's pocket and in the sky above its head; it knows where their vacations were, what doctors are visiting and what they are interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is not yet enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel to the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of the Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to gather as many personal data as possible on its users, and this is necessary in order to meet the original goals of Google's founders: "We gather in a system all the information in the world!".
According to Google‚Äôs leader, the company even after ten years of work that has returned to the World is still in the initial phase of the effort to deal with all the information.
To the question what is going to happen within five years Schmidt answered like this: I wish Google could answer questions such as "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the best work I'd like to do?" - however, software will not be able to answer questions apparently as simple as there are not enough information from users.
Not all netizens are aware that during their online browsing the search keywords, IP addresses and pages are accurately stored when searching.
Thanks, for example, to Personalized Search that started two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-examine what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic the Recommendations will be based on which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases the potential represented by the company is what can be fearsome and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already confirmed that they not only retain, but in justified cases also give to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of the internet.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information of its website, called Orkut, to identify the pedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens concerned with the rights of individuals were relieved in May when the company together with the EFF, an organization for the protection of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated to the court that was right in its dispute with the FBI: according to the judgment, it cannot be forced to Google by any of the points of the constitution to provide any information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has achieved its pretext to strengthen the child protection law adopted years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and some thousand search phrases, but without getting the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords for the past two months.)
This is quite contradictory the opinion about Google: those who fear to provide their personal data criticize it because they think that their privacy, their private life will be damaged when they start using Google services, and they rebel against it as against multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the North American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, internet users and users from other countries, come in them the future generation, the "vanguard corporation", not so to their rival, Microsoft, cataloged by their Windows as the conquest of the world, because they both fight for the same goal.
This may happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems younger, more collaborator than the official software giant practice.
But it can also be because geeks have precisely seen the very problematic relationship between the rights of people and the Internet that has been made just by one of the key words mentioned in recent years: the Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving targeted traces behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: show us ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and even can join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers list of their music customs, then they can include them in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also have a blog, where the latest photos galleries that are automatically stored in Flickr or Picasa are shown.
We can know a number of cases from which the girl appears, for example, when seeing the flow of photographs of the next morning of the common friends, she gets to know who happened last night to her fraudulent boyfriend or can dismiss the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the company's direction: one thing is sure, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
The life "on line" of a person is what she shows herself - this is the definition that is hidden behind the conduct of youth today.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least wants to hide Google's monopoly, can do it (starting with the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but does not leave any traces).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from finding them, but you can replace Google's "on-line" applications, from text editing software to image and read news applications with alternative versions that do not connect with giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile on us.
The public opinion almost looks forward to the day when Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM $140 billion), Intel $124 billion or Coca-Cola $110 billion, AdWords/AdNose advertising areas threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while services that are being introduced more rapidly cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
The critical observers, however, will also find alarming contradictions: for example, the senior management routinely rejected employees' protests after duplicated the company's childcare price, considered too much towards the unlimited number of employees' nutrition, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google submitted to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company under the agreement filtered all information that violates the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but that only when it was already ready to work, what if it is certain that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to go back to the world: while some believe that the Google Book and Magazine project will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the United States Supreme Court, others are afraid of its Health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with prior analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database can provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, a novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, describes this future in an orwelian way, in which only a man of Google's data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped to remove the traces from the author of the double murder in the city of Ozd.
The police interrogated two minors about the double murder of Ozd who, according to reasonable suspicion, helped to wipe out the traces of the crime - said on Tuesday the spokesman of the Public Order Commission of the province of Borsod.
The young people recognized the crime they had been charged with, and they are currently accused of crimes.
The two minors - according to the information of the Hungarian News Agency - are two girls - can defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity you can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The defendant of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - has been in preventive detention since Sunday.
The crime of killing a number of people with premeditation and codecision is being charged.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week, he quoted his creditor at the headquarters of a company in Ozd, where he killed him and then killed the victim's 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man was prepared to commit the crime a long time ago, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden in the crime scene.
The police analyze with an expert on the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - per cent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish, although the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 per cent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State which within a few months wishes to sell 60 per cent of the shares.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the Polish offer has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far they have offered the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche B√∂rse.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Value Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested the newest owner would be the Warsaw Value Stock Exchange and did not deny the possibility that, in the future, the Prague Value Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders agreement, approximately 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with an investment bank of approximately 25 per cent, followed by the Cesk√° Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 per cent and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday's comments on the increasingly deep international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 September".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the US President - the President of the Republic of Rome - the President has not been able to even obtain support from his own party for the draft law made expeditiously, whose aim is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new Pearl Habor, of which the multimillionaire investor Warren Buffett spoke, it is more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11".
According to a part of the Maderine press, Washington is the expatriate key.
In the view of El World, the error of the political direction of the United States was what led to the world economy on the edge of the abyss.
More and more the danger of demobilization of the American monetary system and then this will affect the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congress' vote there was a danger that Washington did not provide a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the biggest transformations in the history of capitalism is being carried out.
You cannot ignore this threat - points out the Geneva Tags-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still draw a life belt to the taxing financial institutions, thus saving them from the collapse with the taxpayer's money.
But if as dominoes rest even more bank, then they will no longer be sufficient neither the new funds nor the new improvisations.
It is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis received only more than EUR 100 billion on Monday - recalls the Der Standard Venus, adding that they are increasingly real concerns that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not seriously dealt with the crisis that passes as a hostage by the Old Continent .
The "salvators" will not have to present at once hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use the taxpayer's funds to avoid a worse situation?
The smart car imitates the flight of the abjorro
What would be the best way to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of existing barriers sensors in nature?
For example, that one of the abeyors.
In a surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, the abjorros gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic steering system of nature-like BR23C cars, to which the characteristics of the abjorches were given, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can exacerbate all collisions.
During the flight, each abjorro creates its own oval private space that actually looks a lot like our protective safety capsule - explained in the Kazuhhiro Doi exhibition, the technology director of RP and development and research.
They play an important role in the composite eyes of the abrasives that are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eyes, engineers used the measuring system for laser beams.
This identifies the obstacles to the BR23C within a distance of 2 metres, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle microprocessor which is immediately transformed into a maniobra to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle's robot imitating the movements of the anchors, modifies the direction turning the wheels to the necessary extent.
Unlike any existing system at present, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the vehicle robot could not react quickly enough as to cover the obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the protective safety capsule, within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what an abeyor does to mislead other abeyorors.
This process must be carried out in an open and closed eyes.
However, unlike the abysmals, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonals, but it can only be bidimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for abjorres to excavat other abjorres, here they only used as a possibility for the car robot the rotating movement and the acceleration plus the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and greater its energy density, which means they have a longer life longer than the lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important is the instinctive and intelligent reaction, not the data processing capacity, nor much less the storage capacity.
This device should only process some input signals in each second and react as appropriate.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, thus using only a few dozens of kilobytes of memory.
You don't need gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step in developing technology to immediately remove obstacles, which according to Nissan's calculations, can be incorporated into the models produced in series within ten years.
Another possibility for your application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, distorting the existing obstacles in his path.
He already has a name for this lovely child.
The written version of the financial ransom package of $700 billion has been prepared to be applied in several phases in order to buy bad bank credits.
In the first phase half of the money will be spent.
According to the Eastern Coast time during the new consultations that lasted until mid-Saturday evening, convention leaders reached an agreement on the financial rescue package of $700 billion in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the North American Congress, saying that there is only a need to formalise the agreement in a document.
The commitment to the package was supported by both candidates to the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the commitment, said: this programme will work and be effective but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about returning it to the economy car.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. the Sunday before the 8th of the night, according to Washington's schedule (or before the two of Monday morning, according to Central Europe's schedule), without causing a spectacular leap in the bags.
On the draft law called emergency law for economic stabilization in 2008, the North American Congress will vote on Monday first and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush consulted Pelosi on Saturday night and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesperson of the White House.
The programme differs from the original Bush proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy bad-quality credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using 250 billion immediately after the Congress votes, probably on Monday, the Ministry of Finance will purchase securities of credit, bad ratings and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the decision of the President.
This programme will be controlled by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The other half of the $700 billion could be spent after a new decision of the Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined approach: it can simultaneously buy bad credit, mortgages and credit fund securities, as well as other "vegetable" credit.
The purchase can be made either directly or indirectly - competent persons of the ministry have been informed.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in a security programme where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, by which the companies will pay the amount for the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated: The law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can even reach $700 billion in order to meet the urgent needs of the US financial system, the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could lead to the demobilization of some major financial institutions.
We do all we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - added it.
On the other hand, the heads of banks who are in a hurry and expect the State's help may have the official limitation of their compensation, which the North American Argot simply calls for gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, in addition to the limitations depend on the form of assistance from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the context of a auction, an extra charge will be imposed for gold parachutes, unless the bank's failed head is retired.
When buying bad credit directly, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the compensation of the bosses is not excessive.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate the participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in North America's history that will be in force a legal limitation on the income of the Directors-General - said Democratic Barney Frank, president of the Congress commission, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from participating banks in the programme, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can ultimately even obtain profits from the transaction as long as the economy is recovered and the bank is with it.
According to the draft law, in the next five years, the President must present to Congress a proposal on how to return taxpayers to financial sector losses.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their reservations with regard to the project.
This is not what the US citizens ordered us to do, i.e. they are not protecting the taxpayer's dollars - said the Republican Congressman of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: the measures urged him to be the same as those responsible for the demobilization of the Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008, national industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent compared to last month's prices and by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007 prices - reported the Central Statistics Office (KSH).
The industrial export prices rose by 1.1 per cent with respect to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent with respect to the previous year.
As a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent over the previous month and by 3.2 per cent over the previous year.
Industrial sales prices increased only to a minimum extent, with 0.1 per cent.
The domestic sales prices of the processing industry increased by at least 0.1 per cent in July.
The higher price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 per cent), primarily due to an increase of 4.6 per cent per month in bags and belts and an increase of 2.5 per cent in footwear.
The highest price level of basic plastic and chemical materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical production branch (1.6 per cent).
There was a decrease in prices in the petrochemical sector, (1.4 per cent), in the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the processing sectors of wood (0.1 per cent).
They did not change the prices of paper manufacturing, editorials and prints.
In the rest of the processing industry, there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent an important weight in domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 per cent was recorded in August, first of all due to the effect of the increase in official prices from the first of July.
In a comparison of a twelve-month period - in domestic sales of the processing industry - the higher price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 per cent).
In the metal manufacturing sector, an increase of 13.2 per cent was observed, while in the food, drink and tobacco industry there was an increase of 11 per cent.
A decrease in prices was recorded in the textile industry (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3 per cent).
In the rest of the processing sectors, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
During the year in the processing industry, prices increased globally by 10.2 per cent.
The electricity prices, gas, heat and water supply exceeded by 18.7 per cent the prices of the previous year.

In the consumer sector, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, in the energy and intermediate sectors prices did not change with respect to the previous month.
In August 2008, with respect to the same month of the previous year, the higher price increases occurred in the energy sectors and in the intermediate industry (16.8 per cent).
There was a decrease of 6.8 per cent in the production branches of consumer goods and 1.4 per cent in investment goods.
The export prices of the industry calculated in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent compared to the previous month, and compared to 12 months, there was a decrease of 3.9 per cent.
The rate of our national currency in one month was reduced by 1.7 per cent with respect to the euro and by 7.1 per cent with respect to the dollar, compared to August 2007, it strengthened by 7.5 per cent with respect to the euro and 15.9 per cent with respect to the dollar.
Will next year no longer need visa to go to the United States?
Kingga G√∂ncz believes that there are many possibilities for the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement to enter into force around 12 January - the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke of this in Chicago, in front of the Hungarians living there.
In his opinion, "the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic depends on time."
At the same time, he warned that in the new system, the entrance premium will disappear, but tourists must register before leaving the country of origin.
From now on, the head of Hungarian diplomacy has been holding talks in Washington.
He will be interviewed with the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing over the Median Cross with the Star of the Merit Order of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with international policy advisers from candidates to the presidency, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the bank's financial rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major North American parties, assured their support on Sunday to the administration's $700 million banking aid programme, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The representatives of the Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon negotiations, announced on Sunday morning: an agreement was reached on principles on the bank's financial rescue package.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and decoupling the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, when economic issues were first introduced, Obama regained some advantage and disappeared the advantage of McCain that he had obtained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy to the Vice-President.
In a half of Detroit's campaign, held last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would quickly adopt the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal included those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We must act now and with responsibility (...) is in danger of employment, the saving of you. In addition, whole industries and the stability of the whole economy," he said to a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not take advantage of the opportunity to qualify as obese McCain's economic concepts.
In an interview given to ABC McCain explained that "we'll all bring this to severe pain (...) but doing nothing is simply not a viable way."
The Republican senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a control commission to the Minister of Fines and the limitation of the compensation of the executives, he insisted on that.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had not played any important role in the consultations, but he consulted the minister daily.
Congress President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that Congressors will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press release of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group became the most conscious voters - says Der Spiegel about the weak election result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a royal coalition.
The mirror (speckle.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Revolution of Bavaria devours its parents" analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polythologist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad two Beckstein-Huber had taken over.
Social Christians had been developing in Bavaria for several decades - and now these modern citizens are the ones who give them their back.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that had been foreseen for almost ten years: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU reached 47.7 per cent, for the first time below 50 per cent since the fifties.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, still during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernisation of the CSU in the devouring province of its progenitors .
The sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the pace they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of the education and settlement of the Northern Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases opportunities and also has political implications.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group became the most conscious, more critical and more tested voters.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks just the conventional groups of citizens were the ones who were more away from the CSU; the autonomouss, the small industrials, the ones who have bachelors and the diplomats.
Thus, less than 40 per cent of CSU support was refused.
The Presse (depresse.com)
Vienna's conservative diary: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved on coalition issues" - deals with the confused situation of internal policy after the Austrian elections.
SP√ñ wants to negotiate with the OVP.
The OVP prohibits SPOs from interfering in their internal affairs.
The BZ√ñ is shown open in all directions to negotiate, the greens in exchange do not yet wish to consult on the coalition.
Elections were already held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the public television debate, the party leaders only allowed to see some of their bars.
Werner Faymann, president of the SP√ñ, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the OVP.
SP√ñ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some social provinces and associations.
Fayman asked the question that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the OVP, at the post of vice-canceller.
He said that in any case they rejected the age of Sch√ºssel-Molter.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Multiterer responded cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere with the internal affairs of the GSP.
It is still open in the party if they choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must undoubtedly be discussed within the OEF itself.
The president of BZ√ñ, J√∂rg Haider, was shown open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to assume the responsibility of the government," said Haider.
Jar√≥ka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, its host is France that this year is also President of the European Union.
L√≠via J√°r√≥ka, Member of the European People's Party by Fidesz, in his full-fledged message, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations affecting the Roma children and is also the greatest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights protection organizations attended the meeting.
J√°r√≥ka - according to the press office of the Fidesz Group of Members in the European Parliament - warned that, in addition to discrimination in employment, the gitans remain out of the labour market first because of their low level of education.
"Most of the young gypsum have not completed secondary education and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a small part can obtain university degree."
J√°r√≥ka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Eurodeputy, it is necessary to raise these issues widely between the gypsies and the non gypsies.
As early as the school starts a gypsum student, it will have more opportunities to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gitanians, as citizens of the European Union, must ensure the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of secret and low-level education," said L√≠via J√°r√≥ka.
According to the European Parliament, the European Union's objective and active unit is necessary to speed up the process of school development immediately, so it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be properly implemented.
"There is a need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and to provide children with the opportunity to guarantee democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full-right citizens," J√°r√≥ka demanded.
The objective of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities organised annually since the Berlin meeting last year, which was held in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a unique forum to promote the elimination of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision will be taken at the end of October on the fate of the failed two Huber-Beckstein
Despite the severe electoral defeat, no heads have yet been cut off at the summits of the Bavarian CSU, the debate on personal issues has now been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party president and G√ºnther Beckstein, the provincial prime minister is still in his office, but he does not know how long grace will last.
The luck of the two, which suffered a 17 per cent election defeat, will be decided at the party's extraordinary congress to be held on the last weekend of October.
The two critical members left the interview: they are not so attached to their positions.
This was intended to bring peace to the angry members of their parliamentary group and their basic organization, who one day after the "B√°varo tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago -- although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career -- the socialist union reached 60.7 per cent, but now, a year after the shot against Stoiber, only 43.4 per cent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopolies" in Bavaria, which gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the province of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate, in the future, they must undoubtedly coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's potential successors, also has a seat in the small intelligence group that launches negotiations with the Liberal FDP and the Right-Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that in the list of the Libres Elections, that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was taken for the two Huber-Beckstein hit and then brutally removed from the scene to the ambitious local politics.
The CSU's top leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, he will also receive an active role of Stoiber, who so far has been moving the strings in the background, the former head of provincial government and former president of the CSU qualified as the darkest day of his political career on 28 September.
On Monday Huber made some critical comments to the CDU, in his view they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and for Angela Merkel himself too.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel cannot be cancelled if they are unable to highlight together the CSU which played a transcendental role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hide his disappointment by failure, the losses of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great Berlin coalition.
What is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After Sunday's elections, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian Parliament.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability it guarantees in the country of Alexandr Lukashenko, in exchange for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral outcome.
Although the country's legislature of 10 million inhabitants, consisting of one hundred and ten Members, has not been opposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of the United Nations Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 election of dubious legitimacy, would "permit" the entry of some opposition MPs in parliament.
Thus ODSZ removed the boycott that he originally wanted to do.
In the light of the expectations of the opposition, Belarus, which is increasingly dependent on Russia - which has taken a credit to moderate the import of natural gas to Russia and which has contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country - has wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not allow for entry to Lukashenko and other high-level politicians to have an anti-democratic political regime.
It was a sign of distension when the OSCE, in evaluating the electoral campaign, placed emphasis on positive and not on errors - such as the ban on participation in a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's primary report on Monday even criticized the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
With all this in the view of the opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners and Minsk are at a low risk of confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of Ossetia from South and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus is theoretically a federal state - has already considered the two regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - said our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the candidate for the opposition of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime fears that even an opponent will be allowed to enter that Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations when it sees the results, but attempts to get voters to deliver their message on the need to make economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties in front of their distribution, but even so I see that they are more and more supporting the change among older people as well - said Milinkevich, making an allusion to the regime of Lukashenko, who believes that its main result is the creation of social security, they do not consider it appropriate nor even the pensioners, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the debt of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the decomposition of social security that "seems to be the silence of the cemetery" - Milinkevich said.
Russian observers, contrary to opposition policy, qualified democratics to the elections.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Independent States Community, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in facts," so the lack of opposition is nothing but testimony of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on you will have breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Palacio Chigi that they will set up automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
but from now on it starts with this measure against who leaves and then goes to the bar to take a coffee at work.
This novelty has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services" says the Minister.
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency is open.
This is Reformism," Brunetta again underlines.
With Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There has been no resistance on the part of employees, the Secretary-General assures: "There has been a change shared by workers and there has been cooperation on the part of them".
Finally, no more breakfast at work time; no more coffee and lunches.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good capuchin at 7 in the morning is a holy hand."
During a convention in the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences for public employees' diseases have been reduced by 50%, meaning 60,000 more people to work in one year."
And it adds that it is necessary to make public administration more effective
Italian, "what wage dynamics ‚Äì explains the minister ‚Äì in the past 8-10 years have been double in respect of the private sector and well above inflation rate".
For now, millions of public employees have joined in opposing the rules of the Brunetta decree in line with the request supported by the Codacons.
"While the minister of the Public Service shows the numbers, the lowest absence of work due to disease ‚Äì writes consumer association ‚Äì the people of the 'empty workers' is growing .
In Italy, millions of employees of the right and productive public administration have joined in declaring war on the illegal rules of the decree."
In particular, the Tar provides an answer to the exclusion of aggregated economic treatments due to disease due to service; the extension of the schedules in which medical visits to the sick employee are carried out; and other aspects contained in the new provisions chosen by the Minister.
Work accidents, Napolitano: "Crasial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 people die, and 27 are permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deaths in relation to homicides.
To draw attention to the institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today, Anmil celebrates the 58th National Day of the Victims of Work Accidents, which was institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalid by the work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses his "great appreciation for the continued partnership effort in the prevention of workplaces, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"It has been manifested, a 'justa', sincerely shared, facing tragedies that, by their dimensions, raise the cry of the media and the participation of the public opinion, instead of the daily reality, offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is no doubt a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular importance is given to the numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep an eye on the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm on social gravity, to apply and to improve legislation.
For its part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber has stressed " how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which violates the conscience of each of us and imposes a determined effort on all institutions to put an end to it urgently".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not remove the number of white deaths equally impressive," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't really want this "tender to decrease" to be translated into less attention, because it's just when attention decreases that the tragedy exploits.
"We believe that at the general level there is still too little to compare the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, on our basis - it has highlighted Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world."
"It serves a further effort - it has added - as regards the communication and awareness of public opinion.
But there is, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection provided for the victims of work" and "assistance deviation to which the system is being directed in recent years".
"The aim is to return the worker's insurance guarantee - it has added ‚Äì because the luck of the accident does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator every time."
Mp3 readers charged, put the hearing at risk
Listen to high volume music for a long time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent injury to the hearing.
As regards the European Commission, which, in a communication published in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risk (Csseri) of the Ue, published today.
"From this scientific point of view ‚Äì it is read in the note ‚Äì it arises that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day with high volume apparatus risking a permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and mobile phones at high acoustic level can inadvertently ruin their ears in an irremediable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Of the scientific evidence ‚Äì followed by responsibility Ue ‚Äì there is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What counts is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must review, in addition, existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and take a step with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise it caused.
"Scientists - concludes executive Ue - confirm that it is a cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar devices."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concerns increase as the auditory damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damage by using solutions such as the reduction of levels and the time of noise exposure.
In its view, the Scientific Committee Ue points out that the users of portable musical devices hear loud volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limit for the maximum noise permitted at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for longer periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that 5-10% of users of such equipment and the number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the Ue.
Rome, Germany sends it to the Commission for the future of capital
Today, the accounts will be closed in March.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which has been installed this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracalla Terms.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official ball" of the Municipality and its lieutenant Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas ‚Äì tends to underline German ‚Äì it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then drop.
There is no remaining position of roles, only the desire to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June ‚Äì announces the intention ‚Äì we will present the strategic plan using the Commission's work on the future of the capital of Rome."
He who accuses the Commission of useless, since its opinions are not binding, Germano says: "All depends on the work that will be able to carry out the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
It is almost always aggrieved in regular management and in emergency situations that are re-invigorated.
On the contrary, we want to look further and longer, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
Rome's intent also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost Roman citizens a euro and it will serve to make the best minds of capital participate and reason".
For Germany, in fact, "we need to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or mobile, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which we have an absolute need, thinking in a unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, as stated by the intent of Rome, would not only be limited to the present municipal borders but would look beyond it" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must develop as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first president of the Americas.
He wrote an American political note that interests him to pass independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who reduced the U.S. economy with his decisions and pipe relations (as he does today) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks against Obama are increasing as they approach the date of the elections.
a woman from Miami wrote on a Web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great stone face: he thinks he won the highest position of the nation he has had two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, they are attacks that do not say much; they are clearly attacks of racial nature and do not answer the electorate's question: will he be a good president? And are the probes; they all say Obama wins and has a good advantage.
Also in this case there is someone who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the interiors of the south of the United States, has written an editorial: once in the chamber to vote, we will know who will vote for the American patriot.
It goes out one side of the U.S. mentality covered up to the last one.
"Tell them what they want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
things never said before now, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the democratics is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent her home to the rear.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to make the bags.
Likewise, Iraq for most has been the weak point of Bush.
Who will take over George W's position will have a huge duty to develop.
Use, the economic collapse is also made for journalists: in newspapers it is time to cut. Many blame the Internet, "kill" of the printed paper.
Fifty American journalists have been questioned by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
But today journalists are almost all pessimists about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared themselves less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destructive economic model.
In addition to the cuts made in the room where editors work to carry out the newspaper, it is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to interviewed journalists, unless traditional journalism, as the majority of the public understand, is substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimistic predominates today about the U.S. journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65 per cent.
Print against issue.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The biggest editorial houses open a crack on the Internet, for many views as the "killer" of the printed card.
The "economic pressure" warned journalists have increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that "do something good" for journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is among those who run the newspapers ‚Äì or the directors ‚Äì and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage decreases to 23%.
For some this has to do with the "security of work".
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
For the journal staff, 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation such as the United States, with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of "tomach or leave it".
Directors receive almost always good wages, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, but retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, reasoning is complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to arrive at 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, are "sick" followed during the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: ROME‚ÄôS TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPOLLA IS GROTTAFERATA
The president of the second section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaou, has decided to reject the instance of real estate owner Danilo Coppola who had requested to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is indicted for bankruptcy in the field of anti-the pact investigation on Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the process of arresting her, last week, she has obtained domestic release, transforming her into a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
Your lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate be able to travel the city road to a capital room.
According to the court, these trips (for which the pm has voted otherwise) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence they accuse him of.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $7 billion rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this was, rather interested in punishing Wall Street to save the economy.
The New York Times gives us a confirmation yesterday informing us that the current crisis is disarming the Republican party, always more divided between its old soul of the East Coast, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, in return, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, especially strong in the states of the Centre and the South.
The soul, in fact, has become prepotent with the vote of the one who spoke at first.
This is just an example of the mutations, of the major mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not just here.
Both in the United States and in Europe for a long time, the crisis seems to act as an incubator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and emerge into the light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-update, the extraordinary re-activation, of the double category of state-sovereignity in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is, indeed, a crisis of banking institutions - which, if they have strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all, the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more committed.
The one that creates an immediate political problem for those who govern it is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and of those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears globally but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of play, or they don't have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union that divides as always between the different interests and different state strategies does not reach a decision on any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and, above all, the grant of funds: from the moment the court comes, it is only the state that has economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of uncalculated value, values in certain circumstances in which no market is likely and no organization can ever have the same measure.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on state-of-the-nation is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance if the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a very attached factor to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of material, while we were convinced that global finance was already intended to dominate the world, we realized that our future would have to make the accounts every time, but with things that are not material, such as water, crops and oil.
All things that, fixed, can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth but are also absolutely united in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever is a sovereign, he certainly has many more letters about him who is not, and to him who has the shame of living in a place without crops, without oil, and without water.
I come to the second novelty that but presages a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Policy and Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective consciousness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, of an inadequate economic nature with many dark areas.
And together, something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a disrepute, intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the Western countries in an increasing number.
It seems always to advance further, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far up, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the understanding exception of the term, having made their own time and being more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in few words, provides underground a ramified but powerful movement of delegitimizing the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which are reflected in an electoral "revelt" or sudden changes in collective humors of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to see).
It is felt that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their journals, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say something, make it increasingly difficult to understand and then to represent, what has been taking shape since today are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis is renewing, increasing and potentially unmeasured.
In the face of all this, talking about a "mass revolution" today is extremely exaggerated.
But having eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue to walk on the walls
To overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in a future walk on the walls like the spider man.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has approached a lot.
With only 2.5 square centimeter adhesives, scientists have been able to have stuck a body of 100 kilos on a vertical wall.
EDUCATION ‚Äì The American magazine Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is a evolution of existing ones using a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a stack of spaghettis" explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of gecos, covered with microscopic hair that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflon and clay paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful from the legs of this reptile and at the same time "is easily dissipated from the walls" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton University of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through the walls exactly like the spider man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are drivers of heat and electricity.
Other applications might have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes for the moment.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - Also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of micro fibers as hair that self cleans from dust during the movement on a surface to maintain a perfect adherence.
Pharmaceuticals: never with fruit juice
Attention to the apple juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken at the same time with some drugs, their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing, as appropriate, the efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packed that fresh ones associated with the taking of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, which since the 236th national meeting of American Chemical Society in progress sends a new alarm to Philadelphia: enough a bowl of apple juice, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some drugs, canceling the beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
The apple juice was already under charge because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, ansiolytic, antihistamines and neurological medicinal products.
PHARMACOS A RISGOOS ‚Äì The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a two-year newsletter alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink in the case is taking a drug such as Diaspam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY THE POMELO ‚Äì According to experts, orange juice and apple contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active principles inhibited by the apple and other games.
From here the call for Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These findings are generally pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually try to change their information notes.
That is why we must always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us get impressed, ask clearly to the doctor or to the pharmacist¬ª stressed the expert from the Ansa agency.
The New Economy in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, his business models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a Keynesian neo teacher at Princeton University and is a New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the most critical of Bush's decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the 11 September 2001 attack, in those days that broke Enron, Krugman had planned in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years it has been reproached for the economy, but that has now been revealed exactly.
"I am surprised and a little upset by how the memory of the scandal of the collapse of Enron and Worldcom has quickly disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a disclosure with an aggressive style, particularly critical of the excessive liberalism of Bush administration.
Open Office, here's the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year on the part of volunteer developers, whose back is monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several news: on the welcome screen and on the less gross magazine interface, add other more consistent ones, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version ISO.
Attention also to multi-operation with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interestingly, some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via email, or the possibility to import the PDF file into the graphic processing module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
On this front you can always create "Hybrid PDF" documents that accumulate the typical Adobe format graphics with elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
The Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene in a number of users, avoiding conflicts of changes, in the drafting of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some of the functions from OpenOffice to the Web (on the cloud, over the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usually the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The CD installation at home or at work may also be sent at the request.
And if the theme of the free can be a link to the dissemination in the homes, it is in business that Open Office's test suite, tries the big bet, and can already count on a number of projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And there is no lack of even the realities that provide an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, in the case of known Access is the program that allows you to work on the base date; and finally Draw the graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we have reached almost 3 million 600 000 already, with the output of the new version is likely to exceed the expected figure.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case on the French tour: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third-class and winner of the best climber remere.
Giving the news is the website of the L'Equipe newspaper.
Kohl, 26 years old, is the fourth positive runner in the Third Generation, after the Italians Ricardo Ricc√≤ and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also those of Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples is among those carried out in the last few weeks in the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry lab.
If the evidence confirms that it is positive, Austria will lose third place in the Tour and will be angry with the two years of canonical decalculation.
To confirm the positive doping news from Kohl to the third generation Epo is the head of the French antidoping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has declared to the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has been positioned in the podium on the back of Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, awarding the mark of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK ARE YOU A QUESTION, ITALY IS RACISTA?
Italy as an immigrant country has recently become only a privileged destination for immigrants" hosted with hostility.
Is this turning the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is asking for in a long article that has devoted to the debate on the subject of racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, who was from Burkina Faso, murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case shows what the New York Times defines as the "north paradise": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are recorded, but also the highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support of the North League".
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Also, the new legislation that the Lega advocates on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines is cited as a paradigm for climate change in Italy.
Trend marked by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano finding Benedetto XVI in Congress has asked the State and the church to work together to combat racism".
Students of the price rental, up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for universities does not know the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the rent union, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people at the highest cost that the family would have to bear ‚Äì explains the head of Sunia's study office, Laura Mariani ‚Äì in these cities the strong demand has completely distorted the market to such a point as to trigger a process of generalized increase to the residents."
In most cases, rental offers contain a number of violations: free, unregistered, canon-free contracts, under bonded rentals.
In the case of Sunia, extraordinary interventions are necessary which, through the revision of the tax burden, can regulate prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, by a bed in the Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; by an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere zone) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students focus on areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros per bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 per individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) they ask you about 600 euros for an individual room and 450 per bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt√†).
Savings are made only if the peripheral area is changed: EUR 300 per bed and 450 per single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and around.
In Naples, you can find 300/450 euros for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed, you have 250/350 euros, at least 350 for an individual.
in the most girls cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the city's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the rent of students and extra-Communitys is more frequent, a further anomaly is recorded: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradise, the cities cancel the historic halls
Historical cinematographic halls close by favoring the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic rooms in a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by Director Giuseppe Tornatore photographes effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centres and also in the provinces.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the great methics in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory," it is as if a friend died, a known one with whom a piece of place and so much emotion was shared," observes the director of the new movie Paradise, the film that was twenty years ago won the first Oscar and the great jury award to Cannes, which had the poetry of a movie room in the province and nostalgia for the way of living the movie that I may have lost for ever.
The figures given by Anec, the main association of traders, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and to pay most are mainly the rooms of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are the first, Emilia-Romeja with 82 less cinemas, following Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsible for its disappearance is the adventure of the multiplex, these three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new mythical cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romeda.
"Italian exercise has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec," it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all of its members are willing to transfer to the mechanics.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the previous debt of the state is approximately EUR 10 million.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To support the sector, between EUR 16 and EUR 18 million per year would be used."
Interestingly, the first Italian city concerned with the closures decided to repair itself with the signature of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono room either in the historical centre or in the periphery.
The rules provide for means of tax facilitation in favour of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators can enter the restricted area of traffic and have special rates for parking.
"It is an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures.
It is true that in contrast to the extra power of mechanics, traditional rooms need to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema was a theme that was always important to me: the closure of the Bavarian cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to carry out the "New Paradise cinema", which I had thought for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I go in front of the Rialto or the National Road Quirinale already closed, where I've lived so many shared emotions, not to see the dusty cartels, I turn to the other side.‚Äù
Link between politics and 'andrangetta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the municipal elections for those interested in the Piromelli cosca."
The charges that the magistrates of the Antimony Directorate of Calabria give to the lieutenant and vice-sender of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torreone and Rosario Schiavone, and to the lieutenant of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafia association.
Also arrested is Gioacchino Piromelli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his lawyer's granddaughter, homonymous of the boss, already convicted of mafia criminal association and to pay 10 million euros.
"Depreciating any legal and moral standard, and in good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay counsellor Piromelli.
"It would have been allowed to the Mafia family ‚Äì write judges ‚Äì to officially enter the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the regional board Calabr√©s Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'andrangetta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
The arresters this morning add to those of the last July after the police had announced the court of the Mafia Piromelli family.
Since the end of the past April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, in 1991 and always on alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been given the responsibility to administer the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, a member of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the May 2006 coup, had been elected as head of a right-wing coalition.
I exploit a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call on the vice-minister of the interior who was at that time Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piromelli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 road project.
Of the environmental interceptions made in Dal Torreone, the judges write, "the availability to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, a representative of a very close group to the Pyromelli clan, uniforming the public administration's elections on the interests of mafias families".
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones go down to the stage
It is an extermination that occupys more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now discovering it, the major global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources upon which the great ones look like Chevron.
The possibility of generating energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the low oil price, in 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was separated, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The London World Energy Council (WEC) estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the sea waves movement.
This amount would be the double of the currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be currents and tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has signed an agreement to build an implant in North Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology ‚Äì he has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the United States oil colossus to the Economic Journal Wall Street ‚Äì and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the United States Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a very important sign, if it is considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to make new drillings.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are following the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increased interest.
Technology for development.
Experts speak of a technology yet at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now, the impacts such as those of the Portuguese or the Scottish are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a good system of connections between them.
The force of the waves, which causes the good to move upwards and downwards, turns into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
Pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For the time being, four of these in-development implants, waiting only for federal approval, by energy, could serve as a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping center and parking, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there are tides makes the turbines turn around, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the Development of Electricity, is now worth the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mainly about the energy of the tides that you and others, such as New York, Maine and Alaska, have invested $7 million in 2008 and is expected to invest 35 million for 2009.
