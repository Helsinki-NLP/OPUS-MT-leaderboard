It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How do they treat you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped worrying.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised he'd help.
It's empty.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look like he's studying you.
I'm walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I call you?
Do you like the point?
He's a fan of bread.
I feel like a fool.
Tom didn't give me enough help.
I'm not gonna use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
Just once we've met.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's get 'em out of here.
How much is it worth?
Our water was close to the goose.
Tom pretended he didn't notice that Mary was watching him.
What are you usually doing on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my father.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still there.
It looked wonderful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
No one knows this.
The exit was closed.
Breakfast is from seven till nine o'clock.
Tom came back last week.
They were all scared.
I've seen it before.
You chose well.
The nudists consider the naked to be normal.
We sat down and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
They kidnapped me.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good wife.
Dan shared his racist attitudes in public.
You know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
The wolves took the herd.
That song has haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll be there.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
The racists are stupid.
Are you happy, Tom?
Did you shoot a gun so far?
I really like that tattoo.
Get a card for a pocket.
I don't want to surrender to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you later?
I feel lonely in this city.
What have they done so far?
Tom's homeless.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for the damage.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch was guaranteed.
What about tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did Tom ask why?
Tom heard his phone ringing.
Tom did as Mary told him.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
Competition for that job is big.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware he wasn't a good father, so he's trying to make up for it.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have to admit something.
He had an influence on alcohol.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's a little rusty in his cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I wouldn't answer.
I have to help him.
He's being critical.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom sucked his stomach.
I really love your older sister.
Can you take care of Tom getting home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go to the picnic with John.
Don't be a jerk with me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous, we're not made of monkeys, but we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Who do you usually eat?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about giving up?
It's been going on all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big a guy for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop calling Tom.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom was eating later.
Are you helping?
Are you the two of you related?
He wants a ham with an egg.
Just put it on my account.
I'd rather go by the subway than by the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Shall we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did You Give Up?
Mary took over the film.
She has a beautiful manuscript.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
I wrote this report to Tom.
Are they buying these?
It doesn't look very good.
Hey, can you give me that back?
That was personal.
I'd better go too.
Excuse me for a moment.
Take off your hat.
Acting is very good.
Please, don't move.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
He asked me to look at him.
We better not get out of this storm.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really eat pizza that early in the morning?
Can you come back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He's gone.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
It's always my nose when I'm real.
We met several times.
Nobody liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The moon's surface is wrong.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way you can understand.
Everybody's looking for luck.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom treated me terribly in the middle.
Tom was wearing a hat that was still worth it.
Tom promised he'd help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
There's got to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what you wrote in the paper.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would have lent you money if you asked him.
Tom's been obedient, and he's even humiliated.
Where did Tom open?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're human beings.
You don't make a man with a hat.
She tried herself.
Run!
Is it paid for the delivery?
I want a knife.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy them for me?
You didn't see that, did you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
The mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been delaying this for too long.
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We're taking checks.
The newspaper's worth a dollar.
How did it get up there?
Tom's drinking a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You hit one.
Macedonia has four verbs: explicit, conditional, ordered and dictated.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The peaceful surface reflected her drawings as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw trash on the ground.
I remember how I met the queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom seemed angry.
What will be the Japanese economy next year?
That's how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you don't sleep?
They're giving me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a bullet.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our yard's big.
It's a children's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back in six and a half.
Tom poisoned me in a bitch's mother.
I didn't have one hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The performance must continue.
Make a good standing scandal.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't pay attention.
I almost fainted.
Choose your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We're not losing gas.
Tom's a tramp.
Who do you have on the list?
He's got a lot of alibis.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you took the flowers to Mary?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I go with you?
Tom seems pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom's sorry about is food.
Be careful not to get stuck in the muddy bar.
Both of them were coughing.
The train passed through the tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That'd follow.
Do you want tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the day of the end when they will try to escape.
Everybody's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom knows Mary from the garden.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom, the police have already questioned him.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still don't believe Tom left.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
Looks like you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's in his room.
No survivors.
She was supposed to shut up.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They're just laughing.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop him, Tom.
I've glued his locker.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to get some rest.
Take Tom with you.
It happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do the job.
Tom doesn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.
This will make you happy.
The king had a particularly difficult time keeping his mouth shut because of the difficult speech.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
The bag's too heavy.
The weather forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels were foolishly trying to drown the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in prison than to run away.
I'm getting dressed.
When do you learn?
It was hard for Tom to swallow his pills.
It's worth quoting a well-known passage of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom's pointless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by humans.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get to it right away.
Didn't you hear me call?
Oh, on a walk.
Don't eat too much.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Pull out the pen.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
So you didn't want the reward?
Look at the demon.
I'm glad you're happy.
Don't be honest.
Why can't you go now?
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Get in touch.
Make him admit it!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is dead.
We've been bankrupted.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me?
I like school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you have to renew your passport?
Mary has no courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's not even a branch height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.
Tom caught the ball.
Where's the nearest club?
Let them call me.
The power grid heats the ceramic plates from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll give me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the woods, monkeys came down from the crescents.
Let's forget for now.
Because of his father’s sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're quick to get the data.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll take it all off.
I don't know.
At first, I didn't take it.
He's stuck in his shell.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Not even Tom yet knows.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he's not cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone left except him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you were playing chess.
It's darker.
The pipes are closed.
I hurt you, didn't I?
Tom doesn't know how to drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
It's a little weird beside him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in the tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom mistakenly told everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The reporting deadline is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on planktons.
We need to get out of here right now.
I'm ready to do that.
My water came to my knees.
Let's make the cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you'll have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Silvia liked the concerts very much.
Invite them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does anyone care?
How do you feel about that?
Tom's beer from the bottle of wine.
I fell off the point.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You mind?
When does it start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are broken.
Tom told Mary to donate money.
I got him with me.
Didn't your name be Cookie's old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But she's lying.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I proposed it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel so good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with it.
Did she ask for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-phase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom's running down the hill.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Senfov is really hot.
We're advertising our products on TV.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened almost thirty years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've seen anyone try to do that so far.
You were a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a kibrite?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
You hit my head.
Anybody in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say "no"?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom was gonna panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's about to go.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
They've blocked it.
Tom's having trouble.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, he didn't get what he was hoping for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it so obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom found me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that enough?
Tom stretched out his hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says the previous bar told him he'd take his pills off of nicotine if he stopped smoking.
Don't expect everyone to share your thoughts.
That's exactly what Tom suggested.
It's kind of wrong for me.
Tom's a smart guy.
Carito's right is a mixture of more spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything he said.
This was a big night for me.
Tom was driving through town with an elevator without notice.
Yeah, anyway.
You want camping?
Who broke the bowl?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to turn Mary out of the plan.
Are you planning to sit here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom seems suspicious.
Keep it to yourself.
You got it now, don't you?
I'm pretty excited.
I'm not employed.
My old English teacher must now be turning into a grave.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, and they do not feel that their own conduct is undesirable.
He wears high heels to make himself taller.
Do you want a bowl?
I'm sorry, I think you've fallen something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't shout.
I'm here with Tom.
Tom was totally humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
And what does it have to do with it?
We're finally meeting, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house is not big enough for our family.
You gave up your idea.
I must sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're such an idiot.
Did anyone hit Tom?
We have a rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used inflexible expressions.
Your coffee's in power!
Tom was a nice man.
It's a big mercenary for football.
Why did you ask me that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the darkness.
You'll be thanking us, Tom.
Tom works in NASA.
Tom's writing.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom writes his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to fight the idea.
Tom's really upset.
Why did he leave so suddenly?
We all experience her conduct as a negative.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Get away from her.
His eyes lit up with anger.
Why did you call?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom refused to help Mary.
It's possible that Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can accomplish everything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask.
You gave me a word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready.
I want you to keep your promise.
I can see that no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "So do I."
There are many birds in the forest.
Please let me stay.
Come on, walk.
He just wanted to meet Tom.
You need to ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible Tom was richer than we thought.
I never meant to deceive you.
What the hell was all that for?
I don't have such a wish.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your soy.
I'm sorry.
I can't find the hotel address.
Smoking means suicide.
The worms, the peppers, and the rabbits are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's burn the fire.
I wanted to get you this as soon as possible.
What's your hat?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom wears his knees.
Where do the pinions come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of skin.
I have to rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom was on the scene, and the crowd was picking up.
I think it's Tom.
Tom worked very well, but he didn't make it.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink gas drinkers.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost got a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Bring her in.
You're cooking a peanut.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going, so let it be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Day, you drank five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking the curses.
I know how it sounds.
Tom apparently didn't stop him from sitting alone.
I'm already feeling much better.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
Why does Tom do this?
Tom stopped all of a sudden.
My father was bringing me here when I was young.
You're such a drummer.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept quiet.
I'm cursed.
Tom's here before.
He was drying his wet clothes at the end of the fire.
He's always stuck with his English knowledge.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have any blankets?
No part of the pig has fallen.
She bought the usual bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are beautiful.
What's going to happen next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
The cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom's packing his bags.
How does that benefit you?
That's very useful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl's slowing down.
It turns out you're an unexpected beauty.
Your prejudice saves a lot of time, you can form opinions without needing the facts.
That didn't work out very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom wasn't having lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Because the note was written in French, I couldn't read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't hold on.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom laughed at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your chain.
That's not a big priority.
Take this.
How long is it now?
Do you understand?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom leaves on the ice.
I'll never capitalize.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
It's the first butterfly I've seen this spring.
Do you want to play?
Why did he let us go?
I was home last night.
The girl who works at the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems fun.
Tom's not very young.
There's a phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda was tired and suspected of being pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Take me to 2:30 in front of the main gate.
The meeting began over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll work as I know and I can.
I have money.
You can learn here.
They didn't tell Tom why Mary wasn't there.
Tom's getting better.
Tom threw the shot.
They're not cocoons.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a wild dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything.
The worst kind of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get tough.
The bees remove the bag to collect the honey.
I need to help them.
Don't turn my back.
I'll never forget it.
Tom won the battle.
You brought them here right now.
Tom lives abroad.
Are they working here?
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary ran into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you help us at all?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting next to the river.
My cat's hungry.
We need some tools.
Be merciful.
That doesn't seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There's a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I still haven't solved that puzzle.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he is.
Tom was moving his fingers.
You know me better than you do.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's in big trouble.
This isn't blue, it's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs usually kill them before they're full of one year, so they eat people.
Could you get my gun out of my leg?
I've forgotten how smart you are.
Can I see her?
He spends his money on the nerds is water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not quite sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times that you shouldn't be too proud.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
It's a heavy book.
Why do we have to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom's been lying to me all the time.
The rooms in this hotel are obviously very bad, and I'm listening to him in the neighbor's chewing gum!
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's go through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, obviously you have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the key.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you touching me?
Please, talk to me.
The angels keep us safe and lead us.

Tom's the real hero.
Where did he come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
It's done.
These goats are burning.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't even think for a second about trying to convince Mary to do it.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I didn't play Monopol from college.
Tom closed his locker.
Maybe we're relatives.
It's my fault I didn't call you.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why are you asking?
It's not back.
Tom's fast asleep.
Be smart and don't tell your people about it!
It was written in front of her.
There are more exits.
Tom's always been very protective of the kids.
I asked the same question.
We had to find a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen shirts.
I'm safe.
You know, you look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I still haven’t found time to write that report.
I can do it without it.
There are also those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
She's dressed.
Tom threatens Mary.
Tom couldn't have been stopped.
I really want to walk by the river in the morning.

Will you take it?
Talk to him.

The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get down.
We need to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
It's empty.
I can't find the formula.
You're in charge.
I'm thirty years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Do you know how to push?
I've got a lot of money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use my dream.
What about the sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Hand them over.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was covered with blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everybody here loves you so much, Tom.
Today, we're going to eat hearts from Italy.
And Tom's from Boston.
It's a cruel bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I wasn't three weeks old.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need sun cream.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unfriendly.
Dinner's right for me.
They were traveling east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I'm not putting up with that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is a source of life.

Who owns this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped clean the cadre.
Come on, come on, come on.
Tom would throw us out.
Tom, don't be ashamed.
I'm just finishing the report.
Come on, hurry up!
You better go.
Tom lost his way out.
I've got two cameras.
What did you find?
Dan told Linda he was a heavy drinker.
It's on Tom's drawing.
The game isn't over.
Tom put his drink down.
They stole my wallet on the bus.

Did anyone hurt you?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
I was paid to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary shout.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The amebs are alive.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Does Tom die of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't have to mean Tom's dead.
The dams create the wind.
Take a clean glass from the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they're going to kill.
I left a message.
Is that all you've seen?
That would be a disaster.
I like the way the French write their word for "bumbleberry."
The needle can start 20 tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's risky without any help.
Is that what you're talking about?
We're pretty good.
The pig is cut to pieces and sprayed.
Ask your face carefully.
I love travel.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I love you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
It was hard for Tom to deal with Mary.
I guess Tom was trying to convince Mary to take over something.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of kind.
Tom wiped his forehead off.
The book is not yet translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters made a lot of money out of the rich man.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
They bite your conscience, don't they?
I wanted blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom's got that scar on his beard?
Tom had a bruise on his hand.
Take a scarf, your nose's running.
Tom went with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
First of all, they were farmers.
You just need to trust me.
I just don't want you to do something you'll regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely leaves.
We set up a tent.
I didn't think it was gonna rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
Camoli would've stayed.
She has ten children.
Tom threatened me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
I'm pretty healthy now.
Tom was still dressed in pajamas and bathrobes when I came this morning.
We've all read that.
Get over here.
You're back.
The sentence is not exactly grammatical.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.

Are there any more questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary’s first teacher.
There's a fountain in the middle of the city.

Don't interrupt Tom.
There were no more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my trials are gone.
The math's the best he's ever going.

Some fish know how to change their sex.
I can take it from her.
Get some food.
Maybe it'll be hard.
I don't curse the kids.
You have to help him.
I thought you might be able to help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's down.
I don't understand why you want to do that.
It makes us work too much.
Slow down.
He wants every wedding to be the bride and the deceased to be buried.
Tom's probably okay.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised when he saw Mary and John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They're offering free condoms.
Wet climate conditions are not the property of the peninsula.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom's never there.
Please give it to yourself.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom pulls out the pen.
Why should I be interested in what you're doing?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a musical box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Shall we arrest Tom?
How long should this medicine be taken?
I don't need a bed.
Put a look on Facebook!
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are truly happy do not record their happiness.
I still don't know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please show me more.
I'm gonna have to paint my house.
We didn't create it.

I teach him English.
What is usually the cause of the pain?
We're dependent on work.
This box is made of cloth.
She dropped the test for a reason.

Just try it.
I want to play, too.
Tom was a piano teacher.
Tom was the only one.
Is Tom interested?
Here it is.
I'd like to have a chat with you about Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never been a surfer.
I'll find something.
We've been eating soda soup.
We can work on the open, if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's treasures.
That cake is caloric.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was working.
Tom's alive.
I blame Tom.
We'll be able to sit down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
They've told me you know how to do this.
You're experienced.

The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom seemed to be upset.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I'm in a car.
I'm not a whimper.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the weirdest prisoners I've ever seen.
I'm going through most of the day here.
Should we wait here?
If you get out so wide, you'll get pregnant.
Does it still hurt?
It was pretty funny.
I set it up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did you say anything to Tom?
Are they all busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom was injured.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't give up.
We were making a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Give me the wine.
All the shops are closed.
You made white again!
Stop hitting the dick.
Tom's done with the gardens.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
No need to play.
We believe in God.
We need to take whatever we need to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'm better off going.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom agree with his colleagues?
That stinks on the couch.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you some advice.
No matter what you do, always give of yourself.
Dan encouraged Linda to report rape.
Tom is a responsible adult.
I can't call them home.
You're a racist.
I've forgiven you already.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow, I still don't believe it.
What's the short one?
Thank you again for coming.
Our mother.
The wounded soldier barely left.
The sun just went off.
I actually know the answer to that question.
Why don't you push me?
What prevents Tom from doing it again?
Tom's doing movies a lot.
I was beautiful.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
The light is turned off from the water.
Tom's kicking the soup.
I'm not kicking you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom's been investigating the objects on the table.
The police threw Dan in jail.
Go back to your seats.
Can I touch you?
You miss something?
Let a man sit down and cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We went between the trees.
Anyway, I'll do it.
I knew you'd stand by Tom's side.
They couldn't escape.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
It's my fault I didn't call them.
Pray to God, not to his prophets.
Tom was acting like a knight.
Now we're even with him.
We're walking to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch in the afternoon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been more cultural.
Have fun with Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
You've been sucking your stomach.
I'm sorry, but my answer is rejected.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is not to give a gift to Tom.
Tom was working.
Tom lived right next to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She's got a short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to learn.
He went down the hill.
Can I make something up?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'm going with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's take a look.
The European wants to drink wine.
My husband's a good man.
He's got a lot of debts.
She knows the most important cities.
What's under the roof?
No one wants to play with her.
Tom's got all his drinking tours.
Are you ready to go?
Tom was obviously out of his mind.
Tom came to them.
You think you can cheat on me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
It can't be him.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to say that.
Who needs a rhetorical question?
Mary was proud of her face.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not good enough.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they scared?
I'm wearing my passport.
It was a novel-work they used to talk about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she comes back.
I don't have any pens.
When should we start worrying?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom wants vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship was sinking.
Did you buy the cure?
Did Tom drink?
It hurts my job.
The question is who will do that.
I'm leaving for Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Are they all happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's pissing me off.
That's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would like to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please, ask me anything.
Hey, what's up now?
I'm not shy.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom's a wunderkind.
That foot goes to school.
It's starting to get into our head that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very polite.
Now the question is, what should we do?
When was the last time you spoke to Tom?
He's finished fourth of 56 runners.
Don't shout.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a child, he was obsessed with the girl who lived on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom's forgetting.
Sounds very good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom upset Mary's silence.
They'll be there soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my rooms.
They weren't acting fast.
I'm weak.
You're playing a wooled sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever unless someone kills them.
I don't want to hang out with Tom.
They'll never take you to that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is Tom looking for them?
Here's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't called.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
They're life-threatening.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary got divorced from her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned around to see her.
Don't you dare ask them about it.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very mature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has enormous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so distracted tonight?
Tom's fallen back.
We're over-extinguishing.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for a refund.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are annoying, and they're getting better as soon as he drinks a couple of beers.
You have a merciful eye.
You don't understand business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
If so, it'll be better... when the worm gives birth to grapes.
Tom's a consultant.
Can I talk to you?
You hurt me by calling me an ass.
Since when did he have a fire?
It's possible that Tom was lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom likes the same thing as you.
I didn't give up anything.
I was thinking of you yesterday.
I know where to look for them.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It's impossible for him to quit smoking.
My hair's falling.
The big question that no one has found an answer, including me, despite thirty years of research on the woman's soul, is "What do women want?"
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
The villagers reap harvests.
Tom won't like it.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the breach?
I can work wherever I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've been looking everywhere.
What was the point?
In each section, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Is it over your head from me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was upset.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer knows how to scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe it?
Maybe Tom doesn't understand how valuable that picture is.
Everybody's up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Good luck!
The concert's over with the folk gymnasium.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not going to move.
Wait a second.
I have something to do with it.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He was running as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I don't have a comment.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's a total of enough air here.
She's married to a man's zero.
The wind's down.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to wear anything sour.
The old detail before death.
I don't like this book.
Luckily, I hit him.
What would Tom be looking for?
The sun is a star between billions of others.
I've got some spasms.
Can someone help me?
We're leaving this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you ask Google for it?
It's not yet spring.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't mind me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
This mystery is solved.
Tom was taken to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in the park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, that's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I'm hoping for.
Are you sure we shouldn't order first?
He who can hear the peppers how they laugh knows and how they taste the clouds.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom's going to surrender.
Just find them.
I can't go out with them.
They pulled the trigger to see who's going first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar's not to eat like goods!
But if I were in Brazil, I'd be much more afraid.
Did you work as a bartender so far?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it at all.
I'm just done working time.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food is cold, warm it in the microwave oven.
The stream's right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money she had saved.
I think it's time you left now.
The guy's a bandit.
It's possible Tom saw it.
Tom's a little bit of a bitch.
Tom's very unsuspecting.
What did they know?
How's the cylindrical wheel?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's drinking.
They accepted your company.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom put a fork in the drawer.
Am I going to be replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
The whales are kind of boobs.
He apologized to Linda.
I fully understand.
Tom seems upset.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he doesn't want to eat in that restaurant.
He's getting ready to roll.
This will make our work much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would you leave here?
You took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not returned.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral marches.
We're probably lying.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me so I'll give you his number.
Tom knew we wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this.
Swallow your gloves.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
That's exactly what I'm worried about.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family, just like myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a bunch of questions.
Who's running things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every people has their own language.
I'd never accept it.
It's gonna be cooler.
What are you drinking?
The way it came - the way it went.
His legs were in the morning.
Tom left his keys.
It all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any new accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on the map?
Tom's inconspicuous.
What's your question?
Tom went to the needle.
Look forward.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Are you upset by Tom?
This is my newest turn.
I haven't been good for two days.
It's a waste of wood, it's a simple winch.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know what the difference between the brain and the donkey is.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
Raining out doesn't matter.
I'll tell them to leave right away.
Tom shouldn't have married Mary.
I got a bad one.
There was no living soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you in a long time, guys.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Do you want to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was throwing Mary with a fucking egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take it.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes any sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of wheat poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I want to watch porn with lesbians.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to take care of it, John, to write his homework.
I can deal with her.
Can you play that keyboard chord?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom's worried right now.
I have no feelings for her.
Looks like I was expecting a little better.
I already believe it.
She writes a letter to her mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom was acting like he was surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to cross the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was inconceivable.
We want to know about them.
Taste it.
The old house has a certain charm.
This is a taboo.
We barely saved each other.
Did they hire you?
It's raining.
Tom could have seen Mary texting.
You'll be better off.
Tom was a little shocked.
Let's do this right.
You can cross Hawaii for a whole year.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most people think that computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Brother, you can't just come to a woman and scratch her-- it's called sexual abuse.
I decided to tell her I love him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm the first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We've wrapped up the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sitting down.
You can't do what you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
She was breathing a lot.
I'm a patient man.
It's not happening here.
It is better to be optimistic than to be pessimistic and right.
The water was milk.
I'm waiting for the traffic lights to change.
The boy was quiet.
The body of the ship is divided into several waterless parts.
Because of what you were cooking, I'm gonna wash the dishes.
Let's leave the subject.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you going home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your condition.
He's got fake cracks.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cake.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear a knock?
I won't wait for them.
You don't have to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Oh, no!"
He's not such a shy boy anymore.
Can you tell?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never evil.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were boys all over the world divided into groups. Some played jams, some tiles, some ball, others rode a dot or rode wooden horses.
Suspects destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk in the bottle yet.
We both have to go.
The pain that causes love is a message of pleasure.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You have to go home.
Come here.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We'll find her.
You misjudged her.
Wait till I check the manual.
Energy comes from inside.
No one trusts them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
You've got your head on.
We're in.
Give the seat back.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want to get my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom's expanding.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to the concert.
Did Tom pick up Mary?
I don't know how that was found there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please, keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm mad.
It's less wet than yesterday.
It's hard for me to make new friends.
It's strange how people in the tropical areas eat frozen food like kari.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom had no family.
I can't determine what the baby wants, because it's pointing to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Although he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom's got a terrible crush on him.
I'm raising orchids in my glass.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go get Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim was never a stranger.
I turned the TV off.
That's a fake sign.
Tom was fighting.
I said he might turn around.
I need you to open my door.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like that happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Do you know how to fix the already?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You have lunch?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
She's got a sledgehammer on one side.
Let's be late for something.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing fine.
She can't read or write.
Tom, you hurt your leg.
Get in there.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everybody's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very beautiful lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail by then.
The most expensive thing is the country.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of the things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is acidic.
We didn't have any food left.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why are you arguing?
I'm sorry, I don't have a prayer.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy the temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That'd probably be a problem.
Figure out how much money we'll need next year.
I burned the kibrite in the dark.
How much does she do there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you getting up at six o'clock?
Tom's sitting back.
Which country is Boston?
Tom's very strong.
Tom's been spending too much time in front of the computer.
That would be a tragedy.

Don't thank me yet.
My cat's happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom was playing on the piano.
I'm clean.
I ate a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You've heard exactly.
Tom's got a headache.
Oh, no.
There's no one.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
He did all he could.
He's a lacquer.
First of all, let's talk about what Tom should do.
My mom's buying a toy.
I'm not gonna risk it like that.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a runaway.
Tom doesn't listen.
They want everything you told them you'd give them.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many respects, women and men are different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the matter?
Is that necessary?
Tom's staying.
I'll never let you go.
He made it look easy.
Ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The bomber's dried up.
I thought I'd ask for their help.
Maybe you should call them.
Some people don't like it.
In accordance with our agreement, she stopped asking me personal questions.
What do you have to do with this?
Did your dog lick them?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.

At the time, we were 18 years old.
I'm making $17 an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.

Is Tom hurt?
They drank you.
Tom started to complain.
I think you should pick her.
He's in a fit.
You're beautiful.
Tom's lost in Boston.

Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready?
How long has it been?
They're not burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the vegetables.
Tom's a joke.
It was a lot worse for me.
Tom's moving to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I've only had one glass.
No one's writing to me.
Tom broke his heart.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm looking for.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to speak with his mouth.
They've all been under control.
Every customer has his own rights.
I'm just gonna call you as much as I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What were you doing last time?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I'm going to the market because the car's broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
We were robbed.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom's not invited to a party often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom's not quite a threat.
It was midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get tired?
Did you change the shampoo?
Tom was looking around, he was expecting something to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
It's hot here, you can take off your coat.
I don't think they followed me.
They don't have a defense.
He often helps others.
Tom is a great pessimist.
You have the right to a phone call.
The shooting was actually much more fun than I expected.

Tell me who you saw.
He lives there on the hill.
I'll accept anything.
It won't be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the children alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It'll be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect wording of the question.
Tom was apparently used to such problems.
You'll be all right.
It was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I had a cup of coffee on the muse.
You rarely went there.
Tom's warm.
Let's sing and dance.

Let's be realistic.
Tea with lemon, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help you.

Tom's gone.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little bet.
I'll make sure we finish this project in time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You're too tight when you're shaking.
What if we don't find them?

Take the first place at the game.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan was smoking marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes on a walk before dinner.
Yesterday she stayed until late.
You're upset.
Everybody shut up.
What exactly happened between us?
What's wrong?
You gave up your plan.
It's not just a guess.
Like we'll find them?
Maybe it's weird.
No one can save himself from death.
It won't help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom was in trouble many times so far.

Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
I got a song stuck in my head.

Experience is not inherited - everyone gets their own.
I want to believe Tom was happy.
This cloth is grown a lot when it's cut.
The truth is the goal, not the destination.

Is that possible, Tom?

I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.

She's running out of half an inch.
I said we're closed.
The question is who will tell him.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom must not be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that Sarkam?
Tom's a wormhole.
I'm gonna have to try and deal with this myself.
The spaceship was bombed.
Tom wrote me more than 30 messages yesterday.
Are you sure you know this isn't diamonds?
You let Tom escape.
What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
Dream you know.
I looked at her.
A great crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The time in April is constant.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
I'm warm.
Tom was a boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm unchangeable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut the sandwich.
Can I see you later?
Tom's legs were cold.
Boys and girls are reading.
Tom has two kids.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom ran into the store.
I met your girlfriend.
You're my luck.
Accept Tom's advice.
Tom left unfed food on the plate.
Tom's changing the direction.
There's no living man in the school.
The rocket's flying.
We laughed.
Tom was a little nervous.
Tom's only been here for a visit.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
I wish you a happy journey.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was considerate.
Tom tried to look busy, so Mary did not ask him to help her.
I eat very rarely meat.
I'm gonna go ask her.
I'm keeping his seat.
Tom couldn't help.
I'll call her later.
The flowers are coming in fast after you cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm wearing a bag of rice.
I can do that for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I ate late yesterday.
I just don't like it.
In addition, I can fly.
We've been spent our money.
There was hatred between them.
There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
You wouldn't want to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may be admired by others, but I have never failed to be anything but what I am.
Sometimes it's hard to determine whether Tom's happy or not.
This doesn't warm me up.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Did you imagine a wish?
Children sometimes fear the darkness.
Stay away.
I had to stay.
Tom is the only one who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked for Mary's money.
Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna catch you.
My bags are packed.
Tom's coming.
I've cut hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
There he is. I like him.
He crossed the street.
As long as there's life, there's hope.
I heard them licking.
It's a shame I didn't drive with a point here.
I have to visit Tom.
What are you uncomfortable with?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I'm not wearing provocative clothes.
This is classified.
That's not so much.
That's what you said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
I'll be damned!
I'd rather walk alone.
How many herbs?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
He's not in the mood.
What did you get?
I've motivated you.
I don't want to fall in love with you.
I didn't see where you put your keys out of the car.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?
He didn't give them a chance.
He suddenly showed up.
I'll do as you say.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He's trading half-cars.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
You know that?
You've done the wrong thing.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's overcrowded.
Who was the thief?
He's got a charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the photos doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this was gonna get rough.
I didn't know if to get angry or laugh.
I'm mad at you.
We were waiting.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
I've always wanted a dog.
You're safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is, will he visit us next month?
The puppets run them with wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you are.
The other girls were feeding her because of her clothes.
You're going to be confused.
I'm not following you.
Maybe Tom already did what he was supposed to do.
I'll give them another chance.
He just called me.
It's a failure. It's a failure.
How are you these days, Tom?
I can't stand to see him.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
She doesn't even understand me.
The bees consider genetically modified plants to be harmful to the bees of health.
Now you can go.
They're taking a long time.
Tom's two years old.
If I can understand, then everyone can.
The tourists were not satisfied.
Tom put his socks down.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom's a puppie.
The laws are like a spider - hunting muscles, but they let the ears and the frightened break through.
You're too proud of a pawn.
When did Tom go to Boston?
You left your key on the desk, as usual.
He took off his fur jacket down, got up, and gently knocked on the door.
Tom seems so happy.
We don't look at the same subject, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
Something was Tom's.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are sticky, but we're small.
We were looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't want tennis.
Did Tom stay long?
He's sending messages to his boyfriend.
Did anyone see Tom?
He avoided the danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to repeat that?
I think you spend too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate.
You sound like you're relieved.
Tom's unforgettable.
Kyoto is an extremely beautiful city.
This glove doesn't turn.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I'm writing my confession.
"Why did you break my vase?" "Love for pleasure."
We were very close.
I'm sweating every day.
Give me your knife.
No one's defending my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked her not to interfere.
Tomorrow's not a big day.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
It's amazing.
Wait till I'm surprised.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet?
Now he's watching TV.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
That's a coincidence.
I'm so glad I'm home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can wrap me around, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never catch my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
Camola, if I could be as happy as you are.
Try this sweater.
The cat's stuck his candies in my hand.
"When did you sleep yesterday?" "At four o'clock." "What did you do so late?" "I spoke on the phone with the former."
How did you get them?
No offense!
I was a little overwhelmed with another.
His heart was broken by unrelenting love.
When is it too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You're distracting me.
His rank is not high enough for that position.
Are you deaf?
I belong here.
You're my friends.
He's a professional chair.
Tom's not as naive as many people think.
I punched his box in his jaw.
We have two daughters and one son.
I'm going to a lunch break.
Did that man attack you?
Fill out the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Is there a word at all?
You're not a Canadian.
I'm really getting married.
Everyone turned him down, Tom.
You can't fire him.
Ken's collecting old money.
There's a lot to say.
I heard you say it.
We have to face the facts.
There's no harm.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom's scaring me.
Tom's sleeping on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can call you a cab.
You're in no danger.
What can I choose from?
We have to put them in bed.
The only thing Tom puts on meat is a beer.
That's what I got close to Tom.
I don't want to derange them.
Tom was beaten.
We're really good.
He fell asleep driving and caused traffic.
I brought some bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?
Tom was very upset.
Why does Tom do that?
I have a mission for you.
How do you form a number of names?
You saved my life.
It was too little.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
You got me a bad smell from him.
It's improved.
This world is a valley of tears.
You don't have to be abnormal to work here.
I saw Tom.
Don't even get angry.
Tom put the gun down.
Tom's gonna have to smack.
Get me some coffee.
You're right.
That was a trick.
We're gonna let the maths go.
Where did this come from?
We're not ready.
Tom was put in jail for spying.
Can we somehow help him?
I hope you and Tom won't be too disappointed.
These little letters are read only by a wolf.
I don't see the end.
They'll come looking for her.
This tooth is a chopper.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I'm not keeping my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I hear grief in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
I'd do anything to make money.
I recognize you now.
I don't want you to say something you don't think.
I've decorated my room.
This is crazy!
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see what he's like.
Stay with Tom to make his safe.
Our train was approaching the small island.
You're not gonna win.
Wait a minute, I'm ready to get my coat, I'm going to give it to him.
Tom was a miner.
It's all white.
I wish I had enough power of will to keep my diet.
The man in question is currently in America.
He's supposed to be guilty.
I'll look at Tom.
I'll be at my desk.
I'm here for the first time.
That pipe sounds very bad to me.
I'm tired of my eyes.
I need to get away from her.
Tom makes $300,000 a year.
Do I really need this?
Do you expect them?
It's a quick favor.
We had to help Tom.
That's all they're talking about.
A boy grabbed my bag while he was passing by.
When's the last time he hit the baby?
I'm a little hurt by my muscles.
We have experience.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'm gross.
They'll quit because I'm too late for work.
I thought it'd be nice to buy you a couple of bets.
Tom, what's he gonna do now?
That's right!
There's always a nice one.
Why don't you go to a doctor?
Ghost, are you there?
There's no smokers here.
Is your freezer still working?
The city restored that old, historic building.
I can't ask him to do that.
He's really proud.
Tom's back covered in mud.
It's not for you.
Tom was wondering if Mary would know what was wrong.
I don't have anything else.
Tom's in the pool with his friends.
Tom wasn't paranoid.
You're very good with kids.
I just threw it in the trash.
We just got out of there.
Tom booked a seat.
I want to use this.
What color was Tom's socks?
Tom burned my cake.
I've never been a juror before.
I've always admired Tom.
I don't like it when they touch me.
Look at the clouds.
He was so angry that his veins were jammed.
Traveling abroad is not a matter of consideration.
Tom ended up as a winner.
Tom's here right now.
I'm here to apologize.
It won't be enough.
I'm hiding from Tom.
I returned home and told my wife about the work in Boston.
Tom took off and lay down.
And the opposite is true.
Tom's very naive.
Tom didn't want to go so early.
I'll explain later.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I'm chewing gum.
The girl playing the piano is my sister.
I'm not sure anymore.
Don't lose hope.
Were you there?
She's wearing a hulahopaki.
They don't miss stones.
Tom's gone to the point.
He's back at 6:00.
The pain in dogs is proved to be higher than the pain in cats.
Be careful when you climb the stairs.
Was he with someone?
I'm not a monster.
What did this come from?
The batter opened the door.
Tom was wrong.
Get your hats off me.
Don't say that name about me.
Are you gonna throw that away?
Tom has a good profession.
They're my stuff.
Tom went for a walk every day.
The same thing happened to my friend.
I don't feel that way about you anymore.
Tom's not crazy.
Tom's changing the subject.
We'll deal with this.
It's a very nice feeling.
What's Tom drinking?
I'll read this.
Give me the glasses.
I'm helping them with something.
I know about him.
We have the key.
Tom had a disastrous failure.
Just get back from vacation.
Tell your son to stop bothering my daughter.
The text's too long.
When did you get to Boston?
I'm late for something.
The caverns contain significant quantities of minerals.
Tom left them.
She's avoiding me.
Tom's back to work.
I want you to find them.
Shouldn't we wait for them?
I wouldn't like that.
I hear you're rich.
Most people are more afraid to face a mistake than to make a mistake.
This is a stupid question, but who's stronger, a lion or a tiger?
We'll have company.
We're students.
Tom pulled the potato out of the champagne.
Thank you, girl.
Tom despises your stupidity.
Don't eat live pork.
Tom made a list of the places he wants to visit.
From his point of view, I concluded that he was angry with me.
I miss Boston.
The girl brought me red and white roses.
We need to ask them.
I think you know Tom.
They don't make you happy.
It's time to get to work.
Shoot three times.
I'll be sorry if I like it.
They're gratis.
Are you coming back?
We can talk about it.
My daughter sings in a choir.
No more words to say.
You can make it easier for yourself.
My dick you know.
It wasn't easy to admit that I was wrong.
We're the best.
Now go ahead.
Tom can't help you.
Tom's not going to the market.
Give me a few minutes.
You can recognize children's voices without problems.
I suggest we go home.
Tom refused to talk to me.
Tom doesn't like me.
Don't you know Tom by accident?
Tom wasn't sure if he liked the plan.
Tom's a very young man.
Tom is so stupid.
Tom wants to see it.
Tom was just joking in part.
I'll find out who did this.
Tom hates his job.
I can make a call.
Why don't you trust me?
Tom was trying to avoid getting caught.
Have you found her yet?
Tom's alone there.
You've done your job well.
Don't be a faggot.
Freedom of speech is limited in certain countries.
Tom took the hat.
We're looking for them.
I think Tom's right.
Could you recommend a good book for me?
I'll take you home.
Does your stomach hurt?
Is Tom dead?
You're not laughing at me.
Try to get rid of it.
I think I love you.
I'm taking care of all of you.
It's a little weird next to her.
You're a pig.
You're not reliable.
Tom can be trusted.
It'll be hard to convince them.
Don't be silly now.
Did anyone see Tom?
I'd like a hand with this.
I owe a lot to Tom.
That was an amazing night.
The scents of jamine and lavender are my favorites.
I just want you to turn around and look at me.
Tom apparently was boring.
She's very individualistic.
The knife had a very old top.
Get ready.
Put him down here.
I swear, I wouldn't get caught up with you if I burned you if you were the last bucket of water.
The universe is expanding.
I thought you lost your handcuff.
Now you're in charge.
Not all of them sleep.
Did everyone agree?
These are my prayers.
Aren't you going?
Do you know anyone who could help?
This week is extremely hot.
No one wanted to get out of the table.
Do you think Tom would like this?
Tom's gone too far.
He's a fool.
Maybe you can help them.
The heart of the broken mirror lay flat on the floor.
I can't ask him for that.
He's eating pork creams.
I have to go help them.
Tom doesn't dare tell Mrs. White the truth.
Esperanto is an agglutinative language.
Luke sheds a strong smell.
I want to get some more sleep.
The tower's looking from here.
They're left on their own.
They're harassing me.
Tom was waiting in line.
Tom knew exactly where he was going.
I'm sorry I lied to you before.
I have a few minutes off.
I'm sorry, but I don't feel like it by now.
When was the last time you were in an art gallery?
Play that song again.
I like vanilla ice cream so much.
I just ate.
Step by step, he goes down the stairs.
That's not supposed to happen.
Let me change the subject.
I'll make popcorn.
Tom put a stethoscope on the chest patient.
Shall we call him?
My sister for Christmas got more presents than I did.
What's going on with you at work?
What's there in languages that don't taste?
Let's play football.
Tom stopped shouting.
Was there any survivors?
I'm still at work.
Tom's warm.
Where's the bathroom?
I guess Tom knows.
She gave birth to twins.
My boyfriend's a reporter.
What are you afraid of, Tom?
Tom would object.
What brand of shampoo do you use?
It's about playing cards.
We all love you.
What were they doing?
I think you should go out on your own with this.
As far as I can see, there's nothing on Tom from a medical point of view.
I saw how to play cards with all of them.
Tom seems confidential.
Shame on you!
Is Tom still alive?
Does Tom have a sheep?
I thought you'd live with us.
How do I know how to get back?
I'm going to dinner with an old friend.
Eating can be overcooked without getting angry.
Bring her home.
I'd help if I could.
Whoever wants flowers can't be a bad man.
Get your computer.
What's the key?
Tom needs to thank you.
I'll see you when I get there.
That could be true.
I wasn't sure what to do.
Camola, I didn't marry Tom.
I know what it is.
When does Tom arrive?
Could you give me the remote control?
I'm gonna get him to pull out your lawn.
You're helping once.
We cried in the duet.
I'll set up the store.
I have a lot to say.
I was in the bedroom.
There shouldn't be any problems.
It's hard for me to imagine.
Where's the nearest workshop to repair the digerido?
Where did you go with Tom?
Does anyone know Tom's phone number here?
I don't know what I got.
I haven't fixed it yet.
I don't work for him.
I can't wait to go home.
Tom killed himself on his thirtieth birthday.
Let's go and see what happens.
The concert drunk has no pedals at all.
I'll keep your place.
We were all shocked.
I don't react well to threats.
Take a breath and keep it.
I love Boston so much.
I know the city whose inhabitants never smoked.
I must have forgotten.
Tom told Mary to go to the party with him.
Tom knows how to do almost everything.
We arrested him.
What else could you do?
Please sign here.
I'll check if he's in there.
It'll be beastly.
I don't think I can move.
I'm glad I can be yours.
He talks a lot.
I'm not quite normal.
I thought they found him.
Why don't we order pizza?
The worse, the better.
Is your head full of straw?
Tom doesn't seem to speak French.
This fruit contains seeds.
You're doing good.
I don't have enough time to do everything I need to do.
The forest is my home.
There's a swelling on his head.
Vampires can't cross the threshold of a certain house without being invited.
I think Tom's under siege.
I need peace and quiet after the hard day at work.
If you ignore the past, you threaten the future.
The windows in my room are broken.
Do you hate him so much?
I want the truth.
Why don't we go get them?
Please find her.
Tom doesn't suffer from Mary.
I'm not ready yet.
This bird doesn't know how to fly.
I'm not a truck.
Tom's studying the law.
Tom loves his job.
I'm an astronomer.
I had to lie again.
What are your plans?
Tom's a lucky guy.
We're not invited.
Paravan divided the room into two pieces.
I plan to skip lunch.
Something's bothering her.
The mud door was open.
I showed my room.
I was in the theater.
I decided to go with the agents.
It's been here since he got from Canada.
Fernando's faster than you are.
Tom oversaw Mary.
I'll come with Tom.
It wouldn't be bad to slow down.
Defend yourself.
Can we give him a fix?
You have beautiful lips.
The rabbits are a infectious disease.
Tom's already in Boston a year ago.
I saw him right now.
What's going to happen to us?
My hometown is by the ocean.
I left home at seven.
How's it going, Tom?
The wind has changed the direction.
Please don't ask her.
I have to take them home.
No one will ever forget you.
Why didn't you call before you got here?
I can't get a good answer from Tom.
Camoli, I'd found out earlier.
Is there something missing?
I didn't do that for him.
She felt quite lonely.
I'm going hunting for free time.
Where'd my driver go?
He's in a mania.
The coat is covered with fur.
Tom's ugly.
When did you buy that with Tom?
I've been informed.
He was fast asleep.
I never doubted that.
The pinions are made in bottles.
Tom doesn't experience it that way.
Tom was sitting on the stairs and talking to a girl named Mary.
I know what you ate.
I always eat.
Tom gave Mary John’s message.
Your wishes are my command.
I have an apartment in Boston.
Can I ask you a question?
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
Someone just called.
Can I show you something?
I'm not a big sailor.
My father got a fire on the white drops last month.
What a sad story!
Try to sleep well.
I don't think I'm gonna live long.
You need to help her.
Take care of him.
Tom wasn't aware that Mary was hoping to kiss her.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I don't have any friends.
Tom's playing in a band and he's very handsome.
Why can't you take it?
Put the gun down.
Tom lost interest.
Let's play the dice.
It was fun yesterday.
Tom might help us if we ask him nicely.
Tom enjoys eating after restaurants.
Tom says he's used to hospital food.
This is my problem.
I don't think he's gay.
It was a secret, wasn't it?
I wouldn't think so.
I ate chicken medallions.
My dream came true.
This is a wooden table.
The situation is tense.
I'm interested in Greek mythology, too.
The observer has a good position.
I'm in charge of the propaganda.
We have to put him in bed.
Tom had respect for Mary.
Tom and Mary haven't heard from John for a long time.
You're not dressed.
They're pretty good.
Did you admit that?
Tom's a diabetic.
Call it whatever you want.
I'll send Tom to take care of it.
How would you fix it?
This sounds familiar.
Would you like to watch TV?
Of course!
They're not happy.
They were verbally harassed.
Why were you chasing me?
I've been busy.
I couldn't do what you were doing.
Are you always busy?
Tom heard it.
You're under her level.
Wisdom is a curse when it does not help the one who owns it.
What is the origin of the universe?
Whoever calls, tell him I'm out.
I convinced Tom he was supposed to go to Boston with Mary.
The sheep feed on grass.
Tom's gonna quit.
I didn't know you were unhappy here.
Tom gave up his mind to go to Boston.
I didn't find anything wrong.
Tom works efficiently.
I should be alone.
I can take it from them.
I read Tom's story.
Why are you tired?
Tom said he'd leave at 2:30.
I'll take it with him.
It's not about luck.
I think you know the rules.
I'm sincerely sorry for that.
How are we today?
There's your wife.
He's back in six.
Let these people go.
Tom's eye didn't blink.
You're a good son.
I'll get you to talk to Tom.
I almost called them.
The lamb saw her.
I have to turn the phone off.
Time's good.
This was wrong information.
No one wants to be around him.
Dan was seen talking to an unknown man near the restaurant.
Tom with ease did it.
I know you're tired.
Why didn't you graduate?
There's a candle in front of my house.
He's the owner of the firm.
Peace at home, peace in the world.
They hate each other.
I'm very busy getting ready for the party.
It won't get better.
He's already done the job.
Shut my ears.
We're not worried.
Don't stay too long.
Tom lives in a boat.
Let's be creative.
You look pretty bad.
I don't want to make any more effort.
We went to the same church.
I arrived in Boston in two and a half.
How could Tom know?
She's studying at a deaf school.
You have a habit I don't like.
You sound very safe.
How desperate are you?
I don't know why I stayed so long.
I don't want to wait.
What is it, to be invisible to him?
The radio's off.
I turned him down, Tom.
You should be proud.
I'm in love and confused.
I'm saving most of my money in the bank near my office.
Do you remember what happened last year?
You're going with me and the point!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
Everything went well.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know Tom.
Let us give our best.
I'll pay.
It's only possible that Tom wouldn't help us at all.
I'd rather sit down.
Read this.
I arrived here a few minutes before you.
I'm helping him.
It's an honor.
I'm starting to worry.
Tom and Mary work in the same office.
Envy is a sin.
All the children are strangers.
They shot me.
Tom's not on the side of the drama.
I've completed twenty-five projects in just one month.
Tom couldn't have gone to see us through the key.
Tea smells good.
Well, I lied.
Do you believe them?
That column isn't exactly vertical.
Let's see what happens if we let Tom do what he wants.
I'm very good with animals.
Did anyone tell you that?
Why are you calling?
They're still talking.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him French.
We have to go back.
That's what I mean.
I don't think Tom knows how to do it.
Tom's got a little dick.
Tom believes everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going anywhere.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's as tall as she is.
They've been chasing them.
I didn't trust him.
Now you can't help us.
Do you know how much that costs?
I was thinking about visiting the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You were chased.
Let's go down the street.
There was no living soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging up wells for you.
I've got a few more minutes left.
Wait a minute.
Tom loves you so much.
You cook well.
There's no shorter way to the top, just to the breach.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's paid a lot.
It was sad.
You seem to care about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Auto cars are now distributed.
I can't make such a decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me that time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's wearing the chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to give up on yourself.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I've got Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my dinner?
The organ was an older man.
I was playing tennis.
I think you can help me.
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do as I showed you?
I'm making a kaygan.
I want the blue color.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take the bribe.
Don't suck my coffee.
Tom gave her a soft - haired rabbit to her daughter.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography with that, it'll be done.
I've been calling for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me to play a girl?
They chose it well.
What does that mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'm going to give you my own, but I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a debt I spent the night with a smart, spiritual and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of parental control.
Tom's a wreck.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census took place in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you'd write me a message at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
Wait a minute.
He's dressed up to get his hat on.
The river of sweat began to sink in my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became an atheist.
Let's just drop it.
I'm learning math.
The keyboards are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How were you?
The movies are a great setback.
At first, I didn't see anything.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love the jazz.
They're staring at you.
I would do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests do we expect tonight?
She's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everybody laughed.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
They canceled our flight because of the unfavourable weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patient.
Singers use microphones to make their voices loud.
They may come back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against it.
The world lights the sun.
His argument was logical.
Come here now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly right.
I'll go see what I can find.
How long are you gonna need to paint my house?
Tom had made himself a tree.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
The airport's close.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get so bad.
It's not coming out of the carpet.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to take care of Mary.
Mary wants to drink hot coffee and Tom's milk.
I gave you the wrong address.
I fell apart.
I'm not angry anymore.
The chances are Jane's coming.
I'm hungry.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The money I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl's got a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I don't care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom's sneezing.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What's my lawyer gonna do?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'll really try to be kind to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does Tom buy?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can someone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's quiet again.
It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Get out of here.
I have a lot of problems right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help.
Tom has a problem with anger.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a new man.
Get me a drink.
I think I'm real.
The question is whether it can or not.
Tom's running up.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I did.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to do this to work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you were only dating girls who were lower than you.
I have to get my belt.
Tom's about to deal with Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This isn't a place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He's seen a new house.
I didn't expect you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I'm sleeping standing.
I'm so weak.
The cake looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel.
What's going on with you?
We want to see Tom.
Where'd you go, Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please, come in time.
The Germans have a weak attitude toward the darkness.
Now we can't help her.
Please don't move.
You can't deny it.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they put his body in a large grave.
Women like men with brooms.
Did you forget your wallet again?
Do you accept a kiss?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do that, then who?
Camoli could have been like Tom.
I suddenly heard a loud noise.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I wasn't lucky.
His body was grown with brown hair.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I've got him so pissed off, Tom.
The week is seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure you like Tom.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants of the island are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always wanted secret characters.
Throw my ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm an anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's the hat for?
Tom is one of the most famous American songwriters.
It can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't worry, Tom.
Tom wants to never come back here again.
No one likes crying.
He was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb the remote mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's pretty fucked up.
Try to explain it to Tom.
We're the first to arrive.
I already gave her your number.
My soap burned my eyes.
I'm glad to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary so much.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'll be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This is not the right path.
I know I can do more.
You're learning fast.
We ate very good food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got kicked.
No one's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had that.
Look out the window.
Mary bought a smelly garbage bag.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He used to work in the garden two hours a day.
Tom rarely leaves.
Tom caught malaria while traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport's out.
You deserve a medal.
They're strong.
How did you make that mistake?
It's good to remember you.
Can she do anything she wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We've got bad news for them.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was planning to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is still not quite aware of what happened.
Cocaine's a drug.
This is a little difficult.
Apparently you already know the answer.
Could you take us away?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns the ship?
Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom was.
It was for our great benefit.
What do you usually do in your spare time?
I'll come to save you.
I've got a stone in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We're fucked.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was boneless coffee.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please give him a chance.
I never ask for my hands.
I didn't tell anyone, even my mother.
Don't get in my room.
That's when we started.
I didn't mean to thank you.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go in the mail with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got some doughnuts.
I'm learning French.
I don't see you.
It was too late.
I live on the lowest floor.
The girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was thoughtless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to make them stop.
I enjoyed Tom's sensitivity.
We need to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went to walk in the woods.
Let's just leave him a little alone.
I never wear clothes.
It's broken. It's broken.
He's gone.
His clients make it mostly poor.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why is that bothering you?
Tom says he wants to do it, too.
Women like men with brooms.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People die all the time.
He's too perfect for him.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's destroying his clothes.
You took out your sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom's not happy to go.
Tom seems a little depressed this morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom's got a good brain.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that topic with you.
Did you ask them for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at the bank.
Death, in whatever form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the cream.
We're old friends.
Tom pulled out his hat and was politely presenting himself.
That's one reason.
Give me my book back.
Marco thinks he's writing.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I use the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very well.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such an asshole!
Who's making him a breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me the captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom didn't want to kneel.
Tom was suspended.
They were laughing.
She'll be a teacher.
I don't mean to tell Tom that.
I'd like a marine fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom seems upset.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Did you become an angel?
That is all we know about them.
Do you think that's what's been bothering us?
Maybe we'll find help in the nearest village.
We hope it's okay.
You're capable, but you're forgetting.
He's been working in the embassy three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom became violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's mad.
It's from work.
We'll make it.
Commendation motivates students to work harder.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom locked the door out of the car.
I don't agree with that.
Stop spending my money.
Tom is about thirty years old.
What's the matter?
I see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure that out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
They attacked him two days ago.
Tom measured his weight.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom's had a lot of changes since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little upset.
He's fucked up.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title "lady" was used only for noble purposes.
Tom's been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Do you believe that?
How to choose a man only one?
I came here to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I don't feel it.
My uncle uncle was there, sprinkled on the bloody bed, with a bogey deep in his heart.
Someone is trying to kill us.
I'm paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long will you stay with us?
You must be very proud.
You used to be so fun.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licks the spoon.
I'm just thinking it out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mail box?
I'm listening to your child's laugh.
Tom suspected that Mary and I were digging something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins in a fight.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunderstorms like Dad's?
Don't interfere with work and pleasure.
I'm working in Boston now.
Put a crown on the king's head.
Tom kept his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll meet you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent is unlocked.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got up from the couch.
Don't get mad at Tom.
I turned the fan on and I directed him to the wall.
This is a home jam.
Tom asked for Mary’s help.
No examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's body in a tomb behind the mud.
Tom's writing very well.
That's not exactly true.
The rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I got you some water.
Let's lick like a dog.
I'm bored with Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as he saw him, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank lent her a million dollars to the company.
I've got a lot to tell you.
I always write down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what matters to you, and I'll do my best to destroy it.
Play relax.
My son always interrupts me while I'm talking.
This is Tom calling.
I'll drive myself.
Looks like I drank too much last night, my head's shaking, and I'm really tired.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he didn't touch the guy's name.
I'll get to your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom shut the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have to borrow me an interesting book?
Tom was moving carefully.
Just get in there.
He wanted a steel sword.
I moved to a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I told myself.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose off.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's a unit.
The woman calls her husband.
Tom really found something interesting.
Niv had a lot more of them than we had.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did you want to see, Tom?
I'm so scared.
Dan's pissed off.
I don't even know what it is.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't stand it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are the following.
This is the pool Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait for me in front of the mail.
What college did you learn?
It's about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I'd better call him again.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't fuck with Tom.
It seemed a lot more than I expected.
Clear your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
I've got a blood clot in my eye now.
There's a visit to Mary yesterday.
She's out of her mind!
There's a son who's gone.
I'm trying to work.
What taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I've got a feeling that the show's going to quit; they didn't sell a lot of cards.
Tom's on his way.
Tom doesn't think he should use deodorance.
Is Tom swimming often?
The girl's asleep.
Go write home.
Don't force the kid to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're laughing.
Tom paid me.
Merak is my book reader.
They killed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom seems upset.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We always have to support our children.
Everyone has their own maniacs.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what he was planning to cook Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I've got the impression that it's raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom look upset?
They'll probably come with a car.
Thank you.
You already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had a suitcase less than I did, they regretted that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live in any part of Eastern Europe?
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a moment.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the lights on.
There's too much acid in the orange.
Tom came here to help.
It's been too long.
I had a doll called Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he'd lick the bunny.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please don't add any comments.
That was Tom's only bum.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
Mollus are usually accompanied by thunderstorms.
Tom wants tea with a roommate.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom seems nervous.
I have a little temperature.
Tom put it on the ground.
There's no end to this lecture!
The glasses are in the glass credit card.
Give us some time.
Tom was wondering why Mary didn't want to mess with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time to change.
You should wear a helmet while you drive a motor.
We're worried about him.
Tom's a British.
John and Eva are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the shrink.
How do you not yet sleep?
Everyone knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They were loving.
I burned the waste.
We both saw him.
That would be uncultural.
Tell us where they are.
Tom's a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropical regions.
I think I've made myself quite clear.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this great?
Tom said Mary's down here.
Why did you draw your face on the wall?
Do you think about them?
Actually, I'm back with the ex-boyfriend.
Just do this thing.
I think Tom's beautiful.
Tom got a little question.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he knows how to play tennis, but he doesn't.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign above the door say?
Sit down.
I was thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and how it keeps its head reminds me of Maria.
Don't stop my way.
We're looking for them now.
I got my shoes on.
Tom would've come back.
She always works worth it.
What state are you a citizen of?
Trade in elephant hair is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet Tom.
I want dogs more than cats.
There's still a little space in the closet.
Thank you, Tom.
Mary paints her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still doesn't know how to swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was at home.
I should've asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
It's not going to hold this heat.
Looks like these two were calming down.
Unfortunately, I can't afford that.
I need you.
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't have any broken money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You've had it, haven't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't mean to.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Go on with your work.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a lonely man, you can say.
I can't handle this task.
Looks like we're gonna have to try harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to the party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you looking for in Boston?
First of all, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree is floating.
We'll keep in touch.
We're almost together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary call John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom's never been sitting for a long time.
Go with the sticks.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everybody was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa have died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll hurt you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
According to you.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought there were bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to leave soon.
Tom doesn't know how to feel.
There's a little more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The rope was pissing me off.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was everything just a dream?
I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a pop.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is Tom like that?
I have problems with the sinuses.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She's handling chicken.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any website.
They've broken the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all the money, but it seems I was wrong.
I've got three boobs.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
He's been back for a week, up-down.
He's slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a turnip.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom seemed really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Get away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly is on the roof.
Her face was smeared with sperm.
Tom's just.
You should do this first.
We met around noon.
Nothing's done to me tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
You know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm so confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was hated and irresponsible, so he was ordered to leave the firm.
I'd understand any of you.
Tom's trying to be a teacher.
I wish you a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people in the house?
Tom should go now.
Why did God make me so proud?
Why are you blaming them?
Get over it.
We're being childish.
Tom was a boss.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom's getting up.
Let's go outside and talk.
I don't know what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Sheika's been snuck in the tire.
We made a tree.
This is much better.
I'm gonna get her out of your lawn.
Tom's doing it for math.
Tom pulled his money out of the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom was always stubborn.
You cook bread in your ovens.
You're a brute.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
I know how much that's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and cheese.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They've been through the door.
Tom came to stay with us a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the other night.
That's so horrible.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them an apple.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't have any use for that.
It's still not worth it.
Cite me an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Was he honest?
The Filljane was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't give up.
They're close.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
The vampire survived in the dead chest.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call somebody.
Where should these documents be handed over?
Tom has a bruise on his eye.
Tom's firm is in danger.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I left this morning, Tom was still on the prairie.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom is clouded.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary would be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can smile at me.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money for me right now.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, and you?"
Molna hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They've raised my salary again.
I'll never even get there again.
I'm filming a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom's got work to do.
What do we do today?
Do you believe in horoscope?
I know I'm going.
I'm contributing.
It was a real disaster!
Tom's good at his profession.
I thought about it.
I'd like to know why they erased my name from my list.
Tom's done all this.
I won't betray her.
The flowers attract bees.
The water's milk.
Before long, there was no growing life in this climate.
You're incapacitated.
What was Tom's answer?
You'll do as I command you.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did what I was supposed to do.
Tom's very far away.
Tom wants to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why doesn't Tom have his name on the list?
Yeah, well?
I have a great interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not aware of that.
She's got tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom doesn't tell the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Will they arrest me?
Unfortunately, it violates all the rules.
What are you doing here?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Come on, beer.
A certain Mr. Kimura is waiting for you on the line.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound dropped out of his wrath.
No, and it's not even under the chair.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't hold on.
Tom covered his head with a pen.
I'm sure Tom feels lonely.
What did you ask for on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
Our solar system is constantly moving.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw Mary's papers on the desk.
Tom did this.
I'm learning art history.
I don't really agree.
What's on the agenda?
There's a lot more.
Looks like these two are back together.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom hasn't spoken French very well yet.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
It's a moral choice for the translator to translate something or not.
You're ugly.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to ask Tom for permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask for his help.
Do I look normal?
Will you eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Take a look.
Give me the French key.
Tom seems upset.
It was a sit-down.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom got the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's courtesy.
Tom has no hope.
Tom wears glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because orbit is oblique, the distance between the planets and the sun is constantly changing.
Tom just told me.
Tom looked deep into Mary's eyes and smiled.
It was very supple in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all right.
The stars are shining.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without shaking my knees.
Tom's a white man.
Tom could be better.
I didn't call you for that, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
To find them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be famous in time.
I don't know.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20th, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait anymore.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was loving of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can eat lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're shooting.
We're gonna go shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's a nut.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would he lie to you?
He has a passive character.
Maybe someone followed her.
My wife was here once.
It's a cure right.
We were on the coast.
I don't want you to abuse them.
Depends on your decision.
That's executable.
Tom's having a bad reaction.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholics?
Tom threatened you.
It's not attractive.
A few people understand that.
You're very cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
She was delighted to meet her lawyer.
That's our best chance.
It smells like flowers.
Tom's getting sick.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom's a fire extinguisher and he's starting to jump.
She's a tennis player.
I wasn't in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have fun as much as you can!
Who are these?
Speak for yourself.
He's been having a lot of trouble.
She slowly developed hatred for me.
I don't think he can afford it.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
So we didn't agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are not logical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't hold on.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer's stuck.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
So the conscience really makes us all cowards.
You don't have to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I don't expect anything less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
Tom took the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You're wrong.
It's good to see you.
Now you must leave, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen emits green light.
The English became my favorite subject.
Things happened fast.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up early in the morning, we faced terrible news.
The knee wound is now gnosy.
Clear your eyes.
Mary's scared.
It's not your job!
Tom wouldn't touch anything.
Tom's an agricultural worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
Since when does Tom sleep?
It's our job to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs some rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mantal bomb?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'm going down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
The blood's broken in his brain now.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't the man you're easy to deal with.
I don't want pork.
She wants to run.
I need a sea turtle.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom read the note.
The kids drew pictures on the sidewalk with the credit.
You're wondering what you've been holding up for so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I need to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom's been married for 26 years.
We've already cleared that.
You want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, it's not even under the chair.
Tom and I are friends to drink.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows there's something he's listening to.
Tom is always trying to act the way he thinks is right.
Apparently, Tom often doesn't understand what's going on.
Come and visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She wants to praise the magnificent scenes she has in the house.
I'm not a resident.
What do you have in the kitchen?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
Who's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning piano.
They need the money.
It's a good swim.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You don't get involved in this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came.
You're not following.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually very common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Didn't I do anything to upset Tom?
The triangles don't have four angles.
There's not enough light to read here.
Tom's counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned away the carmine.
Let me guess.
Tom is ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've been looking everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everybody's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon is coming back.
Tom wears John's shirt.
He found his parents.
He gave us a suspicious answer.
Wake me up as soon as they break up.
Mr. Gorbachev, break down the wall!
Tom seems preposterous.
Tom's done it.
It's like it's supposed to be.
Let's try and get together.
That'll be hard.
I don't like retirement.
Thank you for asking.
I have good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll investigate it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was not to be sent at all.
The girl wearing the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you doing?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so loving.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's nothing urgent.
I'll pick it up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't care about all of you.
I'll come by the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
I'm not very dear to Tom.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom goes to school with a car.
Did you see it?
I'll have to think about this carefully.
I'm buying a calendar.
Everybody's talking about me.
Do you ever think of us?
Are you writing the speeches?
It was a great show.
We need to go find them.
Last time I was home Friday night when I was thirteen years old.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off the hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing it for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's just that Makki made it to me.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to figure out a plan.
Tom's so mad.
Tom's going to sleep.
Let's protect our peace!
Tom's a good weapon.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said we should stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them so much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to feed my thirst.
Tom's here in time.
It's boring TV today.
Oh, great!
Tom found a kid with four lists.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom seems really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found the evidence.
We got to say good-bye to them.
You didn't smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where'd you get that bunny?
You're nobody and nothing.
We're not gonna find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds quite valid.
It's a law!
The water's breaking the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write it down.
Tom's here safely.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
Here, I want challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done that yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Watch out for the leaks they're flying from the fire.
It's just invented.
Tom kept quiet all night with Mary.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I keep dreaming of you.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I'm laughing.
Let's gather the soul.
I'm sure he'll put on the closer test.
Let's go to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three bags of pumpkin.
It was a shame.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my father.
Children love cake.
He was quite restrained.
I can get out of here with Tom.
Tom's getting upset.
This is from us.
In an emergency, what number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't even touch it.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary got Tom all the money.
That's a lot of bullshit.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
It's like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom's starting to knock.
Butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work earlier.
We have everything.
I made him some cookies.
When's the school year over?
You're right from the beginning.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say "Bye"?
How many tools can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be falsified.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom's inconspicuous.
His girlfriend's weakened.
Between me and Tom, it's done.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom screaming woke up from a nightmare.
Tom has a weak look.
The twin didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it over?
Everyone wants lasting peace.
We met a day ago.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom put his eyes off.
The tide wasn't too happy that a peacemaker was coming.
Open up.
Put your pen on.
You may be wrong.
I burned the cake together.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still at school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my advisors about what items to get.
I already wrote everything I needed to write.
Look, don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
Now there's nobody in the school.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's dot.
Is Dan aware of what he did?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in the room under this one?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How am I supposed to get there?
Tom's a nice man.
I never change the sleeping schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen him?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom you saw him here.
Come on, I'll get you.
I set him up, Tom.
You must be confused.
Mary kept something on Tom's ear.
Tom knows he's very vindictive.
I've seen it take place.
We're gonna miss Tom a lot.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do anything like that before.
You're very stubborn.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Daddy really too slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you ask Google for me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just showering.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's on his own again.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're modeled.
What do you want?
Tom found a new job.
Tom's not coming back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack up.
That responsibility for him is a burden.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I ate lunch today.
My pop music is my favorite kind of music.
Half an hour has passed.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was exciting.
I don't see anything.
He's a pretty nasty man!
They blew up their beach tent.
I didn't want that at all.
You better be alone.
I have to warn him, Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and put another one in that place.
Stop!
Do you want cheese?
I'll call you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
The roofs are in no way clear.
That was very rude of Tom.
It's double.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I'm mad.
Let's get you out of here.
Sequencing is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom's staring inside.
At the same time, you are both hard and easy, and pleasant and bitter; I can't live with or without you.
Let's say you're right now.
Tom's doing great.
I don't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one's ever complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's hot in here.
That disappoints him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I don't know.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You missed us.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look like each other.
Don't forget it.
We need to find them first.
I'm taking the bill.
Tom hit Mary on the head with the roof.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We both better get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fussy.
You need to help them.
Tom didn't even cry.
He wrote a book, and that's great.
Tom turned the quack.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm looking at ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is more sad than stupidity and indifference.
They're all claws.
Tom didn't protest.
What are the web sites from?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're compassionate.
I hate ducks.
I didn't say I did that.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent the whole day cleaning up snow.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to run?
I need Tom.
The changes are never easy.
Is he far away from Boston?
They're paying me to help you.
This jacket is too small for me.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could prepare it by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very effective.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with it later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train while he was at work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the wallpaper out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
A guard is coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the locker.
The pigeons are symbolizing peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I will do everything for the good of mankind.
Did you really stay home all night?
Annie's music is beautiful.
Is she a cab driver?
I'm sure I'm losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
I'm asleep.
There is no scientific evidence that there is a connection between the character and the blood group.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who doesn't agree?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom was brave.
Avoid smoking too much.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We've been looking everywhere.
I love your website so much.
I'll catch you.
Push this button.
Tom really can fight.
What's bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom broke his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All the gouts carry eggs.
We'll take something.
I think Tom is cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is boiling in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I'm looking at how things are.
I'm making a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Wait a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where did Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out of here.
His words sound reasonable.
In India there are many rivers.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom wants adventures.
They don't have a hat.
Lots of trees have collapsed.
Lions don't make a difference in colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer's fucked up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look over here.
I want you to get my money back right now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a really good time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try and do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you're married to Tom.
Tom seems kind.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed he doesn't have his wallet.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
I'm running out of my right ear.
Cardboard boxes are cross.
My stomach hurts after lunch.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These don't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to learn.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm attaching the calendar to the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their bags.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
They don't even throw a curse.
Did you get Tom's invitation?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny it.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What is the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for her help.
I decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
The twins have been living for a long time.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom's sleeping very hard.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I like it.
Did you come here with a car?
I don't know the end of the story.
We're done.
I'm sure.
Will you wait a minute?
You're among friends.
You're something I'm weak.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call me?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start again.
It was a hot night.
Thank you for receiving me.
Susan's actually your half sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I'm starting the egg from the undergarment.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
It's love for crazy people.
Why would you help him?
Tom's got his shoes on.
We have lost faith in mankind.
Tom's handling the manager.
I'm actually born in Boston.
And how am I to blame for that?
Why do we all hate each other?
Tom, lend me some money.
Am I interrupting?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Look at how I do.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most plants died.
Hold on, Tom.
You're very useful.
Tom is still unable to talk to us.
They'll be very happy about it.
I'm gay.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom wants cheese.
Can I have dinner with you?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Come on down, Dick, it's dinner time.
I'm running.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's coming in to the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come on in.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses this month.
No one's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Did you pay already?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom put his face out.
What benefit do I have from you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
He burns me when he wears that suit.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor under this one.
They believed.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain it to him, but I don't.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
The dolphins are kind of boobs.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom might be alive.
Will the future be like scientific fiction?
Tom's laughing at you.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to open it.
That narrows the choice.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to keep his child safe.
I drew the word "Alis" to highlight it.
Third luck.
We need to take off.
This is a breath test that's popular in the Philippines.
Nobody said anything.
Let us strive for the good and to give up the vices.
You're smart.
I'm against the projects.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom was listening to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I'm too late.
I could have known Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There's some writing reports.
It hurts here.
You're distracting Tom.
Where did we go?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask.
Just keep an eye on it.
I was just kidding you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to sleep now and finish tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Illnesses are often called at the worst of times.
The dog stares at me like he wants to eat me.
They were animals dressed in human skin, and they were not real people at all.
The man's starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
All is in progress, but beautiful memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want for a drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom think?
It was really nice.
Everyone dies once in a while.
I know how to stay calm.
We love the beauty.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I suggest we focus on the demand to get out of this cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, folks!
This building is a wonderful building.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Do you know how to write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats bring bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I like her so much!
Is this exactly English?
Let's follow him.
Tom gave Mary a towel.
She's got ears like edra.
Give her the table.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
This is a rubber drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only eighteen years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom was wondering what Mary would say.
I don't like how that sounds.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not unintelligible,
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I guess you read my report.
Tom's back.
Don't repeat yourself.
The blacks are red.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look really good.
You're ruining Tom.
Stop it.
Tom looked like he was a mess.
What else can Tom do?
I want to become physically and mentally stronger.
She's a happy girl.
If I could stay, I'd stay.
Please, stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They started going.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Remember you didn't fall.
"I got a nine on the chemistry test.
He was lucky to have survived the attack.
I guess Tom wasn't in a hurry.
Tom was very handsome.
How was the toy?
I'm a student.
It's my time.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'll take Tom for a walk.
I don't like it when I'm alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your point dirty.
He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have a professional experience?
I didn't ask you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do something.
You're my pride and joy.
What'd you say?
Make two lines.
The titles should attract readers ’ attention.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than surrender.
I'm actually working here.
Tom suffers.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like how you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I was watching a French movie with an English translation.
Tom was laughing at Mary.
Tom's back in confidence.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says the child's diseases are fake.
Dan had a rough relationship with Linda.
Everyone's back.
Do you have a violin?
Give us a call.
Maybe Tom could sing us at the wedding.
Which one would you choose, Tom?
The hospital isn't big there.
Most people have to work to support themselves.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary's pregnant.
We'll stay.
I don't fuck their dog.
I didn't sleep properly.
I don't want freedom, and I can't serve a political party.
Girls enter puberty from 10 to 11 years of age, and boys from 11 to 12 years of age.
It's gone.
Tell Tom he can't forget to restore his passport.
The sky will be dissolved soon.
It's cold on a touch.
He thought someone put poison in his soup.
A lot of people do this.
I still can't tell you.
Mary decided to buy a son's dress.
She was touched.
Epten was cheap.

Let's talk to Tom.
He wants strange animals, such as snakes.
We need leaders.
His first day at school.
Don't get dressed when you get home.
Tom taught me to sing.
"What book are you reading?" "Roman."
You're burning the car.
That gun is not a toy, boy!
Half of the species are women.
They're staring at him.
It's for them.
That's Tom's dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to go again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do social work to make amends for all I have done.
Tom's on the tops.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I don't have any complaints.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom aware?
Tom's beautiful.
This phrase can be interpreted in a number of ways, which I should have taken into account when translating.
He's a werewolf.

I wanted Tom to come.
Does Mary like Tom?
I've been waiting for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't care.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows Donton.
You saw what I could do.
We have a lot of money.
Does your appearance match your age?
Can I?
Not all honey and milk in Canada.
I have information on this subject.
Tom got tired.
Do you understand the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
He's weak in sight.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I've prepared a speech.
The socks have an old look.
I wrote that to them.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom was piping.
We want a new carpet.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom had a good laugh.
The teapot's pretty dirty.
You should sleep well.
Tom took off the kilage.
They went for a walk.
This is his grandfather from his mother's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.
The volcano again became active.
Tom told me he should take care of some things.
How will that help?
Dan probably killed Linda by poisoning her.
The little island from far looks like a hare.
Are the pastures in danger?
What did Tom ask?
Stop fooling around.

I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom's a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom's no need to lift his jeep.
You deserve better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not taking the tuxedo.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working for nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know what you're saying?
It hurts so much here.
I hate this carpet.
I'm a little sick.
Tom's been through.
Tom couldn't remember where he left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job's over.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have any pets?
She wasn't right about the picture.
I'll get it.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be kind to each other.
Tom's a substitute.
I think I'd better help him.
But you're smart.

Both books are equivalent to value.
We rented a movie.

I'd buy it.
He's the one who pulls himself in the back.
We appreciate our customers.
We have to respect the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom's a wet guy.
They asked to raise their pay.
I stopped paying Tom's attention.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't eaten, I'd really like to have lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He'd say something.
Grail stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Drop the weapon and get it.
And I'll see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you love.
We bought them those books.
That's totally possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's working like a bribe.
That was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The fan's not working.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
Got it?

Is this yours, Tom?

Just look at you.
This is great.
It's not empty in front of both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should go to the dentist.

Tom's not putting up with it.
The store's closed.
They listened.

They broke it.
Tom's a big quote.
Can I put this here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll take you home.
Tom died of cancer.
What do you think happened?

You should pay your rent in advance.
Put all the garbage in the storm.

I'm teaching Chinese.
Tom was sitting on the desk.

I don't see a conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to have a birthday party next Monday night.
Get the mask out.
It's an option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm bluffing.
I liked the way you dance.
I need you a little bit.
We were deceived.
Tom's the right one.
Tom seems scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now you've got him.
It's white.
Sit down.
Iron is stronger than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
Tom became violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?

My dog really wants oranges.
Your cop's full of books.
Tom wasn't sleeping well.
I'm in a hurry.
You missed me.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in town.
Let's go wake Tom up.
How am I gonna find him?
The ice's on.
I've shed blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get early.
I'm sure it's very easy for you.
I've never been caught.
I love my fatherhood.
I don't know how to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't lecture me.
Tom's comfortable.

The room was locked.
I can't justify it.

Victory is bitter.
They're looking in the mirror.

I'm pretty proud of that.
Look, you don't mind.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers wore steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you talking about, guys?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed that Mary caught the fish.
It's boring to sit at home.
It's not that bad.
They're freaking out.
Did Tom ask why he was late?
Probably won't be worth waiting for.
I have to buy a new line for the room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
You want to go to work?
I couldn't stand it.
It's sunny today, but it's cold.
What's it really about?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom's running down.
Tom gave me a word.
Tom and Mary took us from the first day.
Let's move.
The girls run and play.
I'm not sure Tom just did this.
"Don't you eat Spanish?" "I'll eat it later."
This is my favorite object.
Tom took off the kilage.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.

Tom's weird.
That was very nice.
My dad's giving me a $10 jacket a week.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long did you work for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom sucks me.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you drink wine, it's appropriate to wipe it with a lactate, isn't it?

That's the way I doubted it.
Tom doesn't do what he's supposed to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is not your friend or enemy.

What's he up to for dinner?
What did you do after that?
Take care of Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she started talking, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked the other way.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you cut the price a little bit?
I'll change first.
Tom is now thirty years old.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She's only become a baby baby a few days before she's nine and a half years old.
Where'd you go?
It's important to realize that no one's ever 100%.
He's gesticulating while he's talking.
Sit next to me.

I can give her a message.
She's a little red.

Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions about them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.

I'm collecting stamps.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
Do you live here?
The room looks like a horse.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom Fusser's stuff.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I don't want to talk about her.

It's nothing terrible.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you need to know this.
Are you going to mask yourself this year?
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm not that warm either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an inexcusable act, it is an act to refuse to forgive.

How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he was gone?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm eating for him.
He's going home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed Mary watching him.
That's enough of you to force me.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice man.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is an honor.
Why don't you rest?
You're not asking why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's fine.
The sky is shining.
The gala will wake up the baby.
Just look straight.
That's not exactly what a man should be prepared for.
Tom and Mary are playing rummy.
I made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leans on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think you'd prefer a son.
How did you get here?
You've opened the book.
Don't catch my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret journal.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We've been talking for up to two hours.
I learned about you from him.
I know you're upset right now.
He's gone.
A long walk called his appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom served himself with a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
There's just no way to make Tom swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do it, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laughed again.
My wedding must be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like your hair.
Is he cold outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom's in danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair's broken.
Tom's the tallest guy in the class.
Tom, you grew up fast.
That was our only comfort.
He wouldn't care.
Did you write in the journal today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can you do it on your own?
Is it your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I left prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the key, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't bear it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you blaming me?
Come on, Tom.
I'm just gonna try to get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause disease.
We're ready upstairs.
Tom's got an old ear.
I bought them.
I told you I can't.
Tom's books are translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't get the wallpaper out.
I helped him break the table.
I ate a cupcake last night.
It's better for your health to go up the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is bad.
I'm sorry I even told them something.
I wouldn't ask you if I could find someone else.
Take me to two and a half.
Tom's missing.
I slept in the barn.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That's exactly what it can do.
Aren't you cold on short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
He's got an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever had in my life.
I need a envelope.
Tom's rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Asian Japanese movies?
Did you get them?
The French language was slang first.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cake.
The fingerprints on the knife establish her fault.
Can I wait here?
We can look for a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I made you some cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I transferred him to Tom's schedule that you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real damage.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
Don't save the bell.
He's got me on his head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems stopped.
You're having fun with your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom seems lonely.
How come you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
It smells like meat.
Do I need to know you?
Tom knew he'd cover up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I don't care.
She's running slow.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it's time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just pulled Tom's room out last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a dead chest, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it were higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what's this?
Tom's a nun.
We despise her.
He's here in front of them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom did the new masquerade he just bought.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's snooped.
The landscape's too good.
It's locked.
I found your poppy under your bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test him.
Freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We're gonna have to hurry.
Tom was celebrating the victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'm going to try to hang myself.
Esenta's here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you challenge the transporter?
The water only needs three minutes to close.
They could fire me for this.
What's the point?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was great.
Dan was about Linda for a very short time.
I can't answer the question.
I want to take a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights; they are given in wisdom and conscience and should be treated one another in the spirit of the general human race.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a magnificence.
They kissed each other.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do himself.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
The soup is frozen.
Why don't you go get it?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to understand.
There's nothing going to cost you to fix it.
That means "yes" or "no"?
Tom looked in the tunnel.
How can you be my friend?
It seems familiar to me.
I'm jealous.
I offered to smoke his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
It's got its limits.
With all that heat, I couldn't sleep last night.
Bosiloc, apologise, rosemary, temianite, and organo are popular herbs.
We're ugly.
You're a smart man.
It was all right.
Leave this here.
He's sitting on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door's open.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew he couldn't trust Tom.
I know I'm keeping secrets.
I don't want to run.
So I'm kind of flattered.
I'm practicing.
She may have lied to you, but I'm not!
Let's just get the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I don't care.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled out some money.
The room was a buyer.
It's just to solve this problem.
They have to remove the bullet that stuck to his neck.
Epten's fun.
Does Tom seem upset?
If you can, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but apparently I lost your sunburn.
I don't have a sword.
Suspect's confession.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how it hurts to kiss you alone.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to look in the dark.
Tom's busy with his research.
The cleaners don't help against the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
Looks like we're not going to ask Tom.
My brother will arrive tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are you caloric compacts?
They'll get it soon.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary for the rib.
I broke the vase today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I wasn't late.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make him some makeup.
I was waiting outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and make a little bit.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and your phone number?
Tom was throwing me with a stone.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so mad about Tom?
Tom will be here a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They stood under the roof in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I've got a couple of reasons for this.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't get it.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
Some of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
It's a beautiful jacket.
I like your coffee.
They're all sinking.
I still think about her.
Today I found out there's a movie called "The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was away from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still unable to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many days till Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I don't care about that.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
Clowns are handcuffs.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's cut off.
I'll start tomorrow.
I wasn't honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm eating from Tom.
I want cooked bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep driving and caused traffic.
We were bitten.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with a hug.
It's okay.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is this camera used?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French very well.
Be careful not to overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, I don't understand German.
We'll need about three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I've been disqualified.
Are you done with the package?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's getting better.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not behave.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You're too worried about him.
The president announced that the United States would launch a satellite in orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I here too soon?
That sounds pretty strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Take care, Tom.
Tom's got them on the tops.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up till 2:30.
You really do.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America had no right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom doesn't listen to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Was that all the excitement?
Tom's going crazy somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm clock rang.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
It's a silent fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We need to give Tom a chance to admit it.
The sky is wind.
We don't talk much.
You're a loving man.
Tom's bleeding a little bit.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom gave up on his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to God, and Osaka is similar to Madeleine.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't Tom stop?
I said I'd bring it.
The survivors are kind of boobs.
I'll start.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm cooking soup in a big tanker.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomachs.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell this to you if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the will going?
He wipes his wet hair with his foot.
If an adult lies a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
I may not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I heard about it.
Tom pulled the screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom was shaking his hands.
Open the teapots.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the van.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do everything.
Tom went to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I want life.
Tom's not in his bed.
That was all my idea.
I don't want any trouble.
The book will help you write the witch.
This area is located in the valley.
You really want to stay till Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in his life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please blow the room out.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates laughed at her.
I'm sorry, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he already saw Mary this morning.
I'm gonna have my balls sucked with honey.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the papal escaped from the cage.
We went to get some strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunglasses.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom threw out his girlfriend.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's impressed.
I almost wouldn't have come.
I made cake.
Look at the number.
I was impressed by your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom's giving up.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
Last month, I had an infection of the strong fever.
Look at the girls.
I'll take off the kiln.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my theory.
I appreciate the foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What benefit do we have from it?
I'm just with someone I want to be with.
You invited me to your wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thank you!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick move.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want us to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone needs to stay.
We were completely confused.
You're not a Japanese.
Tom has very good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You need to eat more.
Tom's not going to be a sport.
Shouldn't we help them?
I wasn't sorry about them.
Tom feels he needs to be redeemed.
This message is for them.
When am I gonna get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom took the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your shoulder.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not dating.
Where's the mail box?
The Internet is a serious matter.
Mars is the red planet.
He slammed the dog with a stone.
Tom's staring all the time.
It's seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
I wrote this book myself, Demek!
Don't put so much beer in the soup.
Let's not be fooled.
They looked around.
Tom looked through the window and saw Mary play with her dog.
Tom was drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were happy.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you have to extract it.
Tom's not doing well today.
We don't see.
Mahmoud can't afford to die.
No one's listening to you.
Okay, you convinced me.
I'm ready for him now.
It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hate usually go to a couple.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly.
I agreed.
Tom admitted he blew the red wine.
Do you want a dog?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is good.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Did you hear about us?
We visited Laura's castles.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little ahead.
I think of him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
It would be a pleasure to keep him.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as much as your soul wants.
Just grab my hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very passionate about his job.
Come to the house.
Why is music so much fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston a short time.
How much stomach do I do every day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom's turning to go.
Tom's kind.
What was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate to do this.
Day's turned into a question.
You've got a lot of eyebrows.
Isn't that what you mean?
I thought you were tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We need to let Tom go back to work.
I want you all to shoot them.
I think I'm writing pretty well.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Let's go inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems more reliable.
Do you want to drink water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the amount is not correct.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
Squares have four angles.
I kept working.
They're developing addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll wait there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat down and kept quiet.
Bring the shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary's been messing with her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one was listening to Tom.
You want me to get something from the supermarket?
It's over.
Tom wiped out the knife from the farm.
Tom was struggling to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them addressed me.
I can arrange it for it to happen.
Are your nose bleeding?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his wing with a beer on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
I've had a controversial look.
Come on, don't be shy.
I don't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I'd better come back later.
What are the tigers eating?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Are you going to go down?
Give him the dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
You looked hard through my glasses.
Linda told Dan he was demneling her.
Why would it bother them?
Let's not bother Tom.
It's tough.
I just need a break.
I have a warrant for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave pretty.
I need to get rid of us.
Why is the sky blue?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did he hurt Tom?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
He came over my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has struggled with depression in several periods of his life.
Can I get your bags?
I'd trust them with my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What do you have to worry about?
I need a meal.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who was his French teacher.
The class looks.
There were penguin sticks on the sand.
Tom just left.
Day called the sniper.
I want to brush my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move it.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not impressed.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope you like the new boss.
Did you mention the results of the test?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was starving.
She's studying English.
With such a violent dream, he'll become either a famous writer or a lunatic.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We'll survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We'll visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom slammed the chewing gum.
Let it be mine.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving me birth.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to develop bad habits!
She's starting to act weird.
Probably won't pay the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she was born interested in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
We're as strong as you are.
The president looked strong.
What do you want me to buy?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'm gonna be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do whatever he wanted.
I thought you were playing chess better than me.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are scared enough, everything can happen.
You're a narrow town.
He was running as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's got his neck stuck.
Grab the day.
What's Tom's bell?
He's very handsome.
Let the buyer be careful.
Tom often runs away for hours.
Now it's time for a substitute.
Most virgins have a whole chiman.
You can end up.
Why did you only spray two sausages?
When I feed the poor, they call me a saint, and when I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.
I don't care.
I wonder what he has for dinner.
Tom's interested in French history.
Because the bus had stopped, we waited a long time for the rain.
You're gonna make it.
Is there that dog?
I'm resting.
Mary was wearing false twitches.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he was speaking French better than he really was.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
I got my shoes on.
That medicine calmed the patient down.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look stupid.
His mother's an American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom having fun?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The spinga started to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
That means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fusherski did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed upset.
Please tell them what to do.
The bacteria are microscopic organisms.
I'll decide, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blind.
I've been looking for him for a while.
Good work.
Tom's getting sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got rid of him.
I prefer goat cheese from cow.
We understand that.
How's that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy products in a long time.
I can see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Did you meet Tom?
Is everybody having fun?
I've been awake all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know he's with you.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
Stolars cut down a tree.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Swim the end.
One - half pair shouldn't be able to get married.
The cow forgot it was a body.
Give them the picture.
Tom was buried alive.
It's a hand job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm so confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister leave the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you turn the cigarette off?
What were they laughing at?
Why would you believe her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
Still no sign of Tom’s voice.
Then I was home.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the song.
Lies give birth to other ships.
I don't have any money anymore.
The table is plastic.
The sun's light is supposed to be the best means of disinfection.
You'll take a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
You've got a hard time.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very useful.
You hung me up.
Did you call for quick help already?
After lunch, our plan is to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
The red light's on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much do you wear?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're looking for here.
Blood runs through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
They won't help lies.
My right leg hurts.
The apple is healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where are we from?
I really don't know.
Do you have a chopper?
Tom's on fire for attention.
Day had no compassion for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave a message for her?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
They built their houses from the stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't know English. I don't know Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom wasn't thinking about things like that.
There's a wind.
I'm just kidding you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
And I bought a handcuff.
Just sit there.
Tom barely knows how to go.
So you didn't say you wanted to go with us?
I expect visitors.
They saved the whole team.
What age did you begin to practice?
You're scaring me.
But not in front of the crowd.
The firm was bankrupt.
I'm twelve years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not very verbal.
You were right, guys.
It's happening.
There was no other wound.
I decided to take a train.
I'm sure you'll manage.
You gonna eat at home or outside?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'm going to get worse.
Are you kidding me?
I think I know him.
I'm drinking milk.
Don't upset Tom.
That's a tough task.
You need to make him listen.
I was surprised it was so easy.
Camoli would have been here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom often calls Mary.
Thank you, dear.
They increased the territory of the kingdom.
I didn't come here to hurt people.
I'm sure Tom already knew about it.
My mother's sister and my aunt.
I've been looking everywhere for them.
Tom's incapacitated.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny it.
It's gone red.
I have to go.

His aunt's alone in London.
It's not a big miracle.
They're bad to me.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
Maybe he'll come back tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom hung up on the fan.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mother?
It doesn't matter.
Listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him for you.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these wise advice.
His statement is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Take your things away.
Where did you put it?
Tom doesn't know how to accept defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What do I get from that?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't very busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for a man.
You don't have to be present for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin it.
You're so passionate.
My headache's gone.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planetary.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handkerchief.
Time here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that pretty?
Hey, don't let it be your fault.
Isn't that unusual?
I'm out of the wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom must be stopped.
Isn't that excessive?
They know what happened.
Tom takes the joke off his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower was standing in the middle of a hurricane.
Tom's a big materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little.
Have you read it?
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Give me the cages.
The Hazes worship cold time.
This is a little lame at the string.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Did you forgive me already?
Did Tom know?
Would you lie to Tom?
I'm not even tired.
She's afraid we're losing money.
Tom swallowed his ex.
Canada produces good wheat.
He loves his dad so much.
Let's get up there.
It's not that we're doing something.
Tom had a good time today.
Milton hasn't slept well all week.
When's the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning to stay with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's not a secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you doing?
Now this is your house.
And try some sushi?
How are you doing?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life by doing only what I love.
It's not my decision.
Despite our expectations, there's been no charges.
Hunting is one of the seven deadly fevers.
Tom's irresponsible.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.

What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm also qualified as Tom.
When will my turn come?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a print error.
It doesn't happen very often to buy a thousand-dollar hat.
Is the police coming?
We have to find him first.
Dan smiles at the assistants with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I barely got saved from being caught.
I can't get involved.
You beat them.
They shut up.
Tom's coming back soon.
I'd be in.
The story is written by the winners.
Tom was the only one on the ship when he exploded.
Who's gonna make up for the star?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
There's nothing wrong with me here.
You cheated on me.
It's for the heat.
Nothing's holy.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
No one really knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're kicking her.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted like that.
I was on three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have fish tonight for dinner.
I don't eat restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost there.
Looks like you've got an infection.
I don't like anything smarter.
The sky is red in summer.
I'm here to wish you luck.
I'd be pleased to see you too.
They must be happy.
We have to fix this.
I'm not speaking English.
We'll deal with it.
The bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan well understood this.
Do you want a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
Everyone wants it.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a hard test.
It's hot in here in hell.
I looked at that.
This is your job!
Please come back to me.
He's walking here.
Congratulations on the wedding.
Kids, you're here to stay.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Is your dog licking?
Beautiful!
The palace has a high tower.
The kids have homework.
Let's go get them.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom's gone away.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I won't mind if you leave.

I hate that pipe.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you as much as you are.
It's funny.
It's very relaxed.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was threatened.
Camoli, don't do that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why does no one want to help us?
The hole's tight.
You should go help him.
Do you enjoy that?
I had a great night.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom let go of the sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to carry such gifts.
I humiliated him.
Shut up or they'll throw you out.
Get away from me.
Let's get started!
How long is the road?
I'm good, thanks!
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's getting dark.
Tom's been raised.
I'm surprised Tom went with Mary.

Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know Tom lived in Boston?
Tom, I only wore one shoe.
You don't want to do something that will remind them that you're actually not big enough to be here.
I got the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a curse.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
Oh, my God, he's back.
Ish, jukeello!
They're stuck in the water.
I guess you're busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think.

Tom taught me to make pancakes.
The one who washs the car is Mr. Jones.
Tom looks excited.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
I know Tom's in Boston now.
That's her.
I can transport you.
Is Tom safe?
There's a solution, though.
You're unorganized.
I'm trying.
I'm sure Tom's gonna make it this way.
I don't think I've ever been so scared before.
Can you do the job?
We have to get him back.
You're uncultural.
Do you have any sports?
It just sounds boring.
Bring him in.

The people in Madrid are crazy.
That's totally wrong.

A thousand years make up a thousand years.
I'll put it on your account.
I'm planning to visit Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
It's an honest word.
We have three guards working on a variable.
We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Can you imagine in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Get your toolbox.
Does Tom contribute?
This is a bit of a shame.
We were both busy.
I've been away for three hours.
I want crossword puzzles.
I expected them to be here.
Tom took a picture of this.
Tom shut his mouth.
So you don't hate him?
Stop acting like a child.
Tom's not a fire.
He never hired them.
I want cake.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom's retired.
That was very nice.
I'm going to hide.

I'm used to talking in public.
You were crying out of luck.
Tom's out of prison.
I'm glad I work here.
Where did Tom say he wanted to go?
I'm waiting for green light.
Do you want me to smear your shoulders?
Get on my head.
I got right on my head.
Tom told me he was planning to go to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm going and I'm going.
I'm going to change my clothes.
You dropped my earpiece.
It might sound like a proposal, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd be a great mother.
Tom keeps working.
Please find my head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom disagrees.
They rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, my movie's gonna break.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but never really, it couldn't happen here.
Tom was burning himself in front of the fire.
I don't want to talk about this.

We can start.
Come alone.

Write to Tom.
I had to help her.
Don't risk it.
Isn't that good news?
Let's assume she was here.
Tom's always mad at me.
Tom's just looking.
Here's your schedule today.
Tom's not waiting.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thank you in advance.
The question is, what are you gonna do?
Tom told Mary he loved her.
Well, don't be quick.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
He was back two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you're late, I'll be late for you too.
You really should have let me call a cab.
I made a pie of apple.
The heat from the horse's coat calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book is full of topics.
I think this is over.
Linda was wearing modest clothes all the time.
You didn't smoke?
They let me go.
Tom never thanks anyone.
He's exaggerating his classmates.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom's connected to Mary.
Are you just cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to a zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna have to ask for Tom's permission.
His joke wasn't all funny.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is pointless.
They ate.
How many cup of coffee a day is too much?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I was dancing with my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You're gonna do the same thing in my place.
Now, let's keep talking in the other room.
I don't hate it.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I laughed.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I'm happy today.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop lying.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man were you?
I should try to help them.
Can I get a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom makes three times more money than I do.
I cried one.
Write your birth date.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
I'll call him later.
They're as good as they are.
She looked excited.
We're wasting time.
Tom said he and Mary wouldn't be able to come to the party.
Just try and find him.
Tom put his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's tiny.
Is the difference visible?
Visit us tomorrow.
Tom was visiting Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do that.
Is this your bag?
The most important thing is to help her sleep.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
I'll change the gardens.
They've been scanning for half an hour.
Dolcon's been doing a lot of hard work lately, but he doesn't see even the slightest result.

Please come to me next Saturday, if you want.
I'm not convinced.
That's not necessary anymore.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom's fast asleep.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She was dreaming to become a nurse.
Tom has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hatred.
You've got a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thank you for coming.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom wouldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So there's Tom?
He spent the night drinking in a meatloaf.
I'm in.
Do you need rent?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to repay you.
They're coming again.
You're really nice.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is a no-go joke.
I wouldn't believe Mary at all.
I've never seen the grapes before.
I don't think they followed us.
I feel free.
Just smile and go on.
You didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary escape from prison.
Tom's got no tea.
I'm tired.
But that's not an argument!
Tom got a drink.
What am I supposed to tell the kids now?
Leave him, Tom.

It's a good system.
I don't remember Tom this high.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How did you get on vacation?
Then we were just a few people in the gorilla group.

I'll tell my wife.
If I don't invite Tom to my party?

That's what everyone does.
Tom is often unpredictable.
They loved each other.
Tom collects mail stamps.
I want you to find her.
The water of the sun.
And there's a lot of what's up with members B, B and A.
Tom's free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
I'd be happy if you three were back outside.
What's preventing you?
Tom has thin lips.
The kids are having nightmares.
Tom exercises violin at least half an hour each day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's very fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered with them.
Camoli Tom had more time for me.
I'm digging on him.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a big shock.
You're burning the car.
She managed to learn to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I don't have the power of will when it comes to practice.
Come to Tom.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room's a slum.
For your sake.
I want to watch football on TV.
I'd still like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need so much food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask for his money.
The more I have, the more I have to clean up.
I found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to fight the sun cream.
Was it hard for you?
Tom's voice was barely listening.
Don't be late.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When will that happen?
We're gonna have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or is she just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom's good with me.
No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is just love in search of words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom's gonna wait.
I'm starving for you.
The real story is a little different from what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon's coming down slowly.
Who wants insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you came?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she immediately knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; in any case you have to.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Merissal and Johnny eat pizza.
It's not a big miracle.
We need something to get our mind off the problem.
I called you yesterday.
Let me focus.
She sells sea schools.
Guard the prisoner.
We all like you.
The kid was crying and crying for hours.
I'm gonna go ask them.
Tom's not like his brother at all.
Tom was an intern.
That was brilliant.
Please tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?
Tom wouldn't be able to do that on his own.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce you to Mr. Tanaka.
You know how late it is?
Tom cut the question to eight pieces.
Maybe you'll be needed.
I have a pain in my chest.
I can't untie the knot.
Give me back my money.
You have to show yourself first.
My father is a quiet man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional tapane.
You stole my new handcuff.
It doesn't look very different.
It's over.
Tom and make Mary's room on the bench.
We're using it.
It's okay.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know whether to be happy or not.
Did you save her?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his trip.
Your excuse's up-down right.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary got out of the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the precious stones last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I've already packed.
Since when do you feel the movements of the fetus?
I can't do it on my own.
You better let me do that.
This house is better than the other one.
I'm sure Tom did.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm at the end.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.

I was very pleased.
I feel it in your touch.
She fell from the tree.

Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Tell me if you catch a boy.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can't see him.
I'm coming.
I was in the middle of the night.
Don't expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the good things and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna get mad.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I'm sick of something.
Don't you ever suspect anything?

Watch out for Tom.
They look familiar.
We have a job for them.

You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new in town, and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.

This is really easy.
Are you going to go for a walk?
You should try it.

I'm taking care of him.
Tom's great.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
Tom's getting closer.

Are you leaving Boston?

We could have done it.
This isn't nobody's fault.
I don't like the taste of the cream.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're late.
Tom's been running away for a while.
Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer than yesterday.
It's got to be created from somewhere.
The weekend was fully equipped, with pool, ski, football playground and billiard table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all pioneers.
I'll see you again.
We were so young back then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
While eating pizza, he was growing up at his sister's.
We should've given up before.
That's close enough.
Tom's polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My previous work was crazy.
"Why are you doing this?" "I can do it."
What a pig you are.
Lock the gate.
Tom let go of the heat.
We're all the same.
I want to be next to you.
I think we're close to the solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds quite acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was honest and trustworthy and the other was unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I won't hesitate.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I won't forget.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it in a mess room.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would you trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two kinds in Ireland.
One at a time, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So, what can I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed and he's talking on the phone.
These are wonderful.
Tom's got his hands busy.
Tom was so excited.
I eat pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a traitor.
Where did Tom work?
I need to carry them with me more pride.
The noise's been disturbing the city.
Anyone who wants flowers can't be a bad person.
This isn't bullshit.
They're getting closer.
You're mean.
Did you hand over Tom's note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have little breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you writing to Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom was crashing.
Is she Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She always wears offensive clothes.
Tom was a boss.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about that.
Women don't love you.
It's time to get up.
This isn't your problem, it's mine.
Before I lay down, I drank three pills against the faggot.
Maybe Tom's wrong.
They might need help.
I don't have any vodka.
Tom's acting like a murky brat.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We need to ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
Do you want movies?
Time is forever.
First of all, you have no right to make conclusions, second of all, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
To the public, it's boring.
I'm raising goods.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to borrow her keys.
Tom's got the brooms.
There was a war going on.
And was Tom involved?
The thief turned into a cop.
We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and repulsive.
Camoli could have helped you more.
Tom's not seen anymore.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the building's facade, and when I passed by her with a car, I didn't recognize her.
Is this all there is to it?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This must stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting around the floor.
Tom, forget it.
Invite him to join us.
It won't be easy to do that without much help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works in a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
I've got a sedative.
This is not related to the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed deeply touched by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom was coming from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'm getting divorced.
That dinner.
I'm running out of tissue.
They're gonna make you brutes.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The gas station threw out the brown water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You don't suggest we give Tom all the money, do you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home that I could go back to.
I'm here for my own good.
It's to protect you.
I've always been helped.
They don't want it.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He says he wants to see you.
He was right, Tom.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get any of them?
Can you connect to him?
Tom said if he wins the lottery, he'll buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I don't care about math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to older people.
The precious stones include the aquamarine, the amethyst, the emerald, the quartz, and the rubine.
Go find them.
You've got to ask your mother for permission before.
I'll take Tom's place.
What happened to you coming to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You've got a lot of cocksuckers.
It was a beautiful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for a while.
I've been eating fast.
Tom remembered a variety of things he didn't remember anyone else.
You can easily distinguish them.
I'm gonna go look for her.
Of all the languages I learned, my French was the easiest.
Tom wrote home.
I've counted up to 200.
Watch this.
Shall I go?
It looks like a monkey.
The peppers are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did you want?
We've got a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you get the money on the loan?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea specifically.
Can I get a test?
Everyone was so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'll lose everything.
I need food.
Tom showed Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I have a home.
He's breathing deep.
That's terrible.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily embarrassed.
Is he getting there with the car?
I think I might be able to help her.
I'll do as it suits me.
Tom has a lot of time.
I'll be fine.
I've done something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom was always poor.
It's a beautiful alka.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was mad at Mary.
Were you alone at home?
He made a lot of money out of her.
Can you help me solve that?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to return to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it on your own?
I'll go find another one.
I'm too hungry.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
The spiders make a bird.
You really talk a lot.
Maybe it's too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
Tom doesn't always have to believe what the other one says.
He's in love from head to heel.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter is not married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom's a painkiller.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're upset!
I think it's the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what to do when I'm retired.
Tom recognized Mary's manuscript.
I think you've helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom knows how to do everything.
The sound is soon gone.
Who fried you?
I don't get it myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how palm trees grow.
How do you know about him?
Just keep going.
Tom's a good friend, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How'd Tom get in?
There's someone on the threshold.
Tom wasn't leaving.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try to call her.
It was a great day.
It was a wonderful night.
I think it's possible for me to pee.
Free.
Peter may need a new lung.
How's Tom going to work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom doesn't talk to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom wants to swim.
I'll yell.
I'm not a runaway to you.
What's our situation?
Do you want me to keep it?
You're a real human being.
Boston is a beautiful place.
Who's responsible?
I'm serious.
I think we better not drink water.
No one's talking.
What made you contact them?
Nothing can be done.
Do you have anything?
It's not cold at all.
Will you do the same?
He had witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don't want to be treated differently from the past.
It's supposed to be okay.
I followed the rules.
Tom's a widow.
I think Tom's unconscious.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
You already did that.
You're poor.
Give me another shirt.
Many Russians were killed while taking pictures with their phones.
He believes that the old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who's laughing, but not who's crying.
How old are you, Tom?
She was wearing red marbles around her neck.
The girl didn't say anything.
It was freezing.
There's one thing I don't understand.
It's so different by listening to music.
Try your shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did Tom say he was gonna start his party?
This obviously was Tom's hard decision.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
He was doing his job very well.
My legs still hurt.
I would do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I'm unconscious.
It's hard to assess his ability.
That's good.
I know the man sitting over there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't do this to me.
I'm open to everything.
I've been looking after you before.
Stop where they are.
Are you her leader?
"She wants music, doesn't she?" "Yes, she does."
The berber sucks it up.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm gonna lose.
Her sister gave her an injection against the flu.
Did you try to talk to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom hasn't stayed here for a long time.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell off the stairs while he was cleaning his pants.
Do you have anything to add, Tom?
Shut up, you fool!
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Damascus is in Syria.
All the compositions were good except yours.
I don't think Tom will be at school tomorrow.
Please, this way.
We'll wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
Next year, my birthday will fall on Sunday.
Everyone laughed.
Did Tom look happy?
Who wrote these messages?
Tom's making the cracks.
Tom's breathing deep.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to this cave?
Dan didn't want to go to the orphanage again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
You'll never know.
I still think about him.
I thought it was causing me.
Tom seems lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one came.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it if you don't show him.
You bought Mary something.
Nothing like a lunatic anymore.
Take it, Tom.
Tom started taking off.
I know Tom times.
It looks nice.
We stopped in Boston.
This is almost work.
I can't concentrate on all this noise.
Split the cards, Tom.
The rebels tied his mouth.
Smile at him.
This medicine will ease the pain.
I'd like to honor you for dinner.
Can't that wait?
They'll pay for their superiority.
Dan didn't miss any episodes of that soap.
I love peppers.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We have a few questions to ask you, Tom.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I hate her as much as you do.
We can get you some help.
I heard him.
We're investigating the whole area.
Don't forget Tom still loves you.
Tom told me I'd like to visit him tomorrow afternoon.
Everyone's gonna miss me.
Here we are.
Why do they do that?
I've been in college for four years and I've got nothing but a poor diploma.
This is priceless.
Do you want to draw?
It was pretty disgusting.
Tom's listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're together again.
After the fire, there's only ashes left.
Tom wants some kind of vegetable except for a plant.
Try to put yourself in his skin.
Tom used to write poems.
We'll take Tom home.
Tom should know about this.
I'm ready to replace.
People can't create miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to exclude him from their company.
Those who interfere with the verbatim endings "-sigh" and "-hi" are waiting for a special place in hell.
What happened after that?
You know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like they're all over the place.
I didn't count on that.
I wasn't.
I saw Tom just last week.
It shouldn't take a long time for this.
I'm trying not to dry up.
Tom got to clean up.
We're so angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everybody knows how to drive.
Tom's got two pipes locked up.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom didn't leave a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences all month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You earned something.
It's really bad.
Do you want a cough?
They're saying that wise roadmen contain a lot of nicotine.
Looks like I'm feeling a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't want surprises.
My wife is holy and devout.
I'll take him to Tom.
I don't think I can put the test.
I think we'll join.
Tom went ahead.
Tom's holding his car.
You're interesting.
This time I can win.
All the people of the earth came from a common ancestor.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I don't.
I'm having fun.
We all have to go find Tom.
I'm fine.
Do you need help with this?
Tom, your patent's open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom's not going to the market.
I came to get him a present.
I asked her to describe it.
I just had a shower.
I didn't do it myself.
What is she?
Can people really be so mad that they think that the entire population of Georgia, who speaks Caucasian language that does not have any common backgrounds or common letters with English, can completely conquer English in just two years?
I'm just waiting.
Tom doesn't want milk.
Our trials were empty.
There are too many things I don't know.
He had respiratory problems.
Tom's good at tennis.
Berlin is very cold.
I'm the crazy one.
Tom was ridiculed.
You miss Boston?
I think you should call him.
Every student has his own locker.
Tom's not my type.
These are for them.
Do you really have to work this weekend?
What's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I got something for him.
How do I know if Tom's the one for me?
Tom's studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that sound beautiful?
This isn't Tom's first delay.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It doesn't depend on you.
The students left.
You've done so much.
Kate is very charming.
Where did you go?
Your path is hard.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom took his bat and started playing.
Tom wants to be rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Get him out of the way.
Blood flows through the blood vessels.
You're borrowing books.
I can't move.
Tom was wondering how good a singer Mary was.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not musical, but I'm singing under the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing a fight.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
What didn't help us?
I want to learn French a lot.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan learned the hard way.
I showed them the fake of my friends.
I give my employees the right to go before.
Are you here alone?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
The cat's on the roof.
What's in that closet?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too low.
I'm sorry.
What books do you need?
Tom asked me if I like Boston or not.
I don't like big dogs.
I'm thirsty.
He was eating tea salad.
I'm going to run.
Tom's got some gum.
I want to buy you a present.
It's stuck.
Tom never visited Boston.
It's nice to be independent.
Tom's pretty popular.
I have a big family.
Now no one can help me.
I'm glad you're back.
I'll get some ice.
Come and take a look.
Do you think you like it?
Innocence is most often a blessing, not a virtue.
Tom's on his pulse.
There's a restaurant nearby, but it's not very good.
That mistake is very common.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
She kept bragging about how her boyfriend was kind, compassionate, courageous, and yet unknowable.
Did you lie to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
Tom trusts Mary.
You were busy.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks to the victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom's watching TV.
I don't know why I always have to be.
They stopped going.
That's not a mistake.
I saw the hamster in the mine.
I was born in 1980.
Tom loves his life.
The shape of the skull is different with different people.
I became uncomfortable with heteroormatous propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't last much longer.
You're good for yourself.
That whole thing makes sense.
I'll open the door for you.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked you how you were.
I don't know how to behave here.
We need to advertise on TV.
Tom's incredibly chimpanzee.
They won't help you.
I feel great.
They're not there.
Nothing's right for me.
They have a good appetite this morning.
The rat made a hole in the wall.
Tom hated us.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You should be happy for them.
This priest is very hard.
Tom stopped crying.
All these things are waiting for me.
Is it a diamond?
You know I don't eat meat.
It seems very sleepy.
Yesterday, I prepared a cake with wheat.
I hope it works.
Why don't you let me find it?
Tom won't be home for lunch.
Is there a reward?
Believe in science!
Although the rainy worm also owns male and female reproductive systems, it needs another one to thrive.
The failure shamed Lisa.
I heard Tom got sick.
Tom was unconscious.
Don't smoke in here.
Is there a key to Tom?
I'm going right now.
Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
It is assumed that the temperature of the sun’s surface is about 6,000 Celsius degrees.
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
The crowd's gone.
Tom started working.
Tom wanted Mary to buy John's birthday present.
Cover it.
The police are looking for them.
What's the deep pit?
The bread is fresh out of the oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'm gonna get Tom to examine him.
That was a shame.
I need Tom's address.
That's kind of sad.
I just didn't believe her.
It's possible that Tom left.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did Tom want to eat?
I got Tom's keys.
Tom refused.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's ten o'clock.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen years old.
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
Do you know so much about us?
Someone killed Tom.
Tom wasn't impressed.
That was really bad.
This must be yours.
We're here in time.
I was kind of sorry for you.
Cigarettes suck for adults.
Tom and Mary left hand prints in the liquid cement.
Cavaller would never do anything like that.
I love them.
Did you try hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was inconceivable.
This is wonderful.
Tom, don't do me to Tosho.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I'd say no.
No one deserves to die.
I didn't know what that meant.
Tom never lost hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
In what situations would he do that?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the goldsmiths.
Luckily, the hole is stable, otherwise the storm would blow it all the time last night.
I heard they caught her.
Tom's been written down somewhere.
There's no good news.
And who do you work for these days?
I'll give up.
Maria’s eyes were filled with pleasure.
It's bad to puke.
I only have one minute.
Tom never gives up.
I think Tom's conservative.
How many are you guys?
I'd like a piece of pie.
I'm tired of your ongoing complaints.
Don't you care what's going to happen to Tom?
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's making herself mysterious.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too soon.
You scared her.
Tom deceived us.
What was I saying?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The salesman cheated on him.
It's all in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.
I paid the penalty.
I want to know who that phone call was from.
Were you home at ten?
It's closed today.
Please report to Tom.
I'll get her to help you.
I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.
I was thinking about you.
Where could Tom be?
Tom's on his way to Boston.
I have plans for dinner with Tom.
She made me a cup of tea.
It's just a job.
I hear there's a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and came to address her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
Would you like to go to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I look forward to seeing Dadob's new version.
It looks pointless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why don't you sing?
Did Tom really do that?
I didn't know how to play basketball at all.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
Tom's not going to be a sport.
I'm surprised, Tom.
I don't see anything.
Let your horses know.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt very lonely.
I really want to try new things.
Tom wasn't the only survivor of the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom's not laughing.
I started seeing him.
We'll hurry.
You haven't eaten yet?
Tom found me a cab.
He did a miracle.
The irons are chewing chemical substances in the body.
That wasn't my idea.
Tom's resting.
Don't run around.
It's best you don't talk that much.
This is a new model.
I've been providing help.
Music unites.
This is just a simulation.
I'm glad to see you, Tom.
I was kind of sorry about her.
He's too generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bike.
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Come here!
You could've refused.
Why don't you let me help?
It'll happen soon.
Hey, it's delicious here, get me out of here before I get drunk.
It'll happen what happens.
I heard that story.
It's still dark outside.
That's what Tom wanted to say.
Is Tom there?
I'll find her.
The police found nothing to link Dan to the robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers were from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Julia.
We need to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom was acting decently.
I guess I'll have to wait a little longer.
You can leave and stay as you like.
This is your wine.
I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you talk to me?
Where will the meeting be?
Let's play "True or Challenge."
His conclusions are based on unproven assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom started to clear the book.
That's the real reason.
Tom loves flowers very much.
Tom told Mary to be careful.
I fainted.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very kind.
Do you know who I am?
Why don't you listen?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a song of cheese for me.
I don't want you in danger.
I'm fat.
How long have you been in front of a computer?
My wife's getting sucked out of the day's routine.
I want to know how you did it.
Amebites are single-cell organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long were you in Boston?
Tom raised my hand.
You're crazy!
How late was the train?
Let's park there.
That's very stupid.
It was hot yesterday, but today it's more sustainable.
I'm cold.
He was walking in front of me.
Give it back to me.
He's breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This isn't fair for me.
Maybe someone's been following them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
That's so boring.
The kid kept all the money in his wallet.
Camoli, let me meet her.
They laughed.
I'd like to hear from him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This won't work.
He's gone soon.
The children were so excited about the party that they couldn't sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel so guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You hit me.
Do you think we'll get to the station in time?
It was all right.
The mother was cruel to her adoptee.
The international language would be of great benefit to mankind.
I gave them help.
Have you decided yet?
Dan asked Linda to sleep with him.
Tom didn't cheat on me at all.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
You can't just leave the baby.
Tom has mental problems.
Tom started eating.
She's kind.
What time is it?
Nice weekend.
Do you want some gas?
Tom stabbed the girls.
We've been looking so hard.
Tom works differently today.
Throw them out of the deck.
Japan as a country has a very different reputation.
It's disturbing.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
The nuns used to play tennis on the Monasteries.
Don't be so pervert!
Tom wants proof.
We didn't come here for them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your paycheck.
I'm sorry, I called the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom's got little hands.
I'm worried.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The study included mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
Tom's over the money.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
So you didn't say you knew how to swim?
Don't push Tom.
They betrayed me.
And he's missing the paper.
Tom doesn't know how to express himself.
Attend the meeting.
I'll find a picture of how you kept your speech.
This sentence has five words.
He was eating lamb creams, potatoes, and wheat soup for dinner.
We were waiting outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier this way.
Tom lied to you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom's doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not an option.
How old were you when you got divorced?
The French is heavy.
I rarely ask questions.
You're a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor's looking at the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.
The smoke is rising in the air.
The printer doesn't work.
I'll send you to the door.
It's dark here.
Tom's a bully.
This was too much for her.
Tom was wondering what would happen if he pressed his blue button.
If you see Tom, could you give him this?
We can order pizza.
Tom's much better.
I just want to talk to Tom.
The prince is handsome.
We're drinking water.
Maybe we should stop.
Mary was representing her team at the game.
Tom doesn't want a party.
It looks like an egg.
I just want to visit Tom.
I'm one.
We don't want any new accidents.
There's no way he was Tom.
I'll kill you.
Most people have strong resistance to getting up early, even when they have to.
Give me the gloves.
I saw Tom.
Who's there with you?
What are you so excited about?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom went mad.
It wasn't very good.
The mechanics should be understood in oil and engine subsampling.
How was yesterday?
You have to learn valuable.
We can't let them go here.
They have families.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's have breakfast.
I'm sucking my omelet.
Tom and explain to Mary the rules in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
You're sick, aren't you?
I totally forgot about him.
An interesting question remained unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I pulled my knife out.
They were dancing.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I'm going to bed in ten and a half.
I don't know where it went.
There's a boy running to me.
Tom now seems very tired.
I'll follow your instructions.
I put it together.
Tom stayed calm.
You said you'd help.
The cells are the basic composite units of living creatures.
They're having fun.
I need to get dressed.
How long do you work as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
A chuconba died one day after my older sister was born.
He's been wandering for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom's sitting here to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom's almost lost in the crowd.
As far as you can tell, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still a knight.
This is hard for me.
Now how do you feel about her?
Don't surprise me.
That surprised me.
This is the thing we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sex - borne disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around at the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why are you getting married when we kiss?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I misjudged her.
It's almost over.
I didn't say I did.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom's talking.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He knows how to play a piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the semen.
It's not too early.
Can I eat?
They dyed the frames of the yellow windows.
Tom, are you in here?
You can use this car.
Nice to meet you.
It's like I'm crying.
We have to wait here.
Is everything all right with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing his blood.
I have to stay here.
Everything or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
No one's talking about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholics?
You and I are gonna fly the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom doesn't listen.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at the auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour to the event.
You were amazing.
I won't give up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird lifted the branch with the clone and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to go.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man three years ago.
Everyone laughed at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom's unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to take some time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell do you buy?
Tom was struggling to get rid of himself.
What am I gonna be?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not the right time now.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot more than I thought it would.
Tom's running by Mary.
I'm being grabbed by a cat.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is how Tom did it.
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bath suit?
His nose's the best.
Now I can't ask them.
Tom's got a gun hair.
Long live the USSR!
Epten is strong.
I want to buy pineapple.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's just a question.
The bush is burning.
Tom was touched.
I've been bitten by conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
The frogs are wonderful creatures.
There are three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom's drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little sloppy.
We humiliated Tom.
You're getting a lot of trouble.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's doing something.
You should've asked her first.
Tom's got a scar on his face.
Don't you believe us?
I respect you.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was the trip nice?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom's got his heart.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed out.
This is the king's most trustworthy adviser.
Did you buy this for her?
Go get dressed.
Tom was really mad.
I'll cook you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else am I gonna get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you to think more about it.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a handcuff.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice Mary's not at the party.
He's changing things.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom kept climbing.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that?
What did they find?
You lied to me in your eyes.
I'll go find her.
I wanted to change.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware Tom did that.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
They'd just cut Tom's throat.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I taught him nasus.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach and they spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on strike.
He's a little deaf, that's according to the speech.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
You're up for now.
That's a very subtle explanation.
The snacks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them on a level-by-level basis.
Wasn't it awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all eager to see the movie.
It's simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing his shirt in one piece.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
The evening was so good!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and sharing is not.
I'm in trouble.
Tom took the hat off and gave it to him.
We're losing oil.
I don't think Tom's going.
Whose manuscript is this?
Did you see what it says in today’s newspapers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks from three to six coffees a day.
Tom's out loud.
It was better.
Tom started screaming.
I'll ask you to stay for a while.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone showed it to her.
Maybe Tom will die by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was furious.
This Limenka is empty.
There's grapes in the refrigerator.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to be listening to Tom for the first time?
Tom put his hand down.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
My money's all over my glasses.
So it wasn't.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's the fact.
We're all cheering for her.
Didn't you see the Alo flag?
Get out of here!
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I think I found one of those.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom survived without food all week.
I don't get it.
Although I am a God - fearing husband, I am still a man.
Tom's sorry he's late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom's got to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't get so angry.
A lot of people are hunting.
He deserves the reward.
Can we talk?
Where did we go?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We need to look into something.
Tom open his eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are you doing?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary kept him quiet.
We met in the maean.
How was Tom?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
There was nothing to drink.
I turned the whole city looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The drug has to drink on an empty stomach.
Tom's not involved.
Looks like our job is not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
My blood's down.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you some bread.
The pigs from the marzipan don't grow up.
Tom wakes up.
Tom was angry with Mary.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
That's what Tom's doing.
Tom might be here today.
Tom doesn't make a difference between reality and fantasy.
Tom's a hero.
Tom has no power at all.
Will you help me?
Don't let me down.
Tom wasn't home when I came home.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's go once more.
You better die on your feet than live on your knees.
They dig a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I've been home all night.
We got out of there at 11 o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
He used to love Boston.
We don't have that much money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
You only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it's from another dimension.
I'm getting bored.
What's the time?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they're still making it up.
Each member must be present.
She didn't understand the joke.
This is the biggest snow I've ever seen.
She's hoping she'll go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you understand his name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
Bread is made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagrees with Mary on that subject.
You're right.
I'll go.
Today is my sixteenth birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar to me.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy gifts?
You two are very cute together.
You're beautiful.
Tom and Mary were having fun together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What's the luck?
Dan wounded Linda's dog.
You blew your key bone while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blind.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was a genius.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I'll wash my car once a week.
Please report them.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I had something to cook.
Keep an eye on the road.
We're gonna stop by the road.
I heard Tom ride.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't spend my nerves on that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
It's time to close.
Let go of me.
The stone went down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom's crazy.
Come on again!
Don't make his heart.
You don't have to comment.
The chicken's raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin's very sweet.
You're such a jerk.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was okay here.
They look so excited.
I could make it easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I'd never get out of the house after the poppies.
I think Tom's a sepide.
He's sick of a terrible infection and the ovaries and he's gone.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't work.
There's no point in it.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's always acting weird.
We'll hang them.
Now it's probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was very stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incapacitated.
Tom bought two tickets and a cup of popcorn.
You're influential.
I got a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we make a cupcake?
I need a secretary.
This girl's the smartest.
I had to protect Tom.
This just relaxes.
Call him right now.
Hold on to the subject.
She really wants to talk.
I have questions on the tone.
This is an interesting, funny, even vivid story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language is different in the world.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put on your pajamas.
This way.
This is the Holy Land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom would want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday's in July.
We have everything.
What's a beer?
Tom said he doesn't know how to play tennis.
Where did you find her, live?
This was at the top of the pile.
I'm done with it.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't talked to me since we retired.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found another one.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's hot enough for the decoy?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you worried about him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling.
I lost my sense of time.
This island is an American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I've got the cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are gathered in the room?
I've already thought about it.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You took off your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little nervous.
