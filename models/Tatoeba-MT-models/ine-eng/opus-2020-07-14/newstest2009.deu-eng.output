The Prague Stock Exchange breaks down to the minus.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of CEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
At the beginning of the Tuesday's business, the Prague Börse just touched on the break-in of Monday when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time the reason for the break-in was on the Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic too, the market's response to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector.
Stocks in Asia
A dramatic case on Tuesday experienced the shares at stock exchanges in Asia, although the indexes during the day could offset some of the losses.
The Hang Seng Börse index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but later it was able to settle some of the losses, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprise Index, which monitors the movement of Chinese shares at the stock exchange in Hong Kong, fell by 3.8%, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares at the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then lost to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the United States is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide," said the Head of the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong determines, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, so independent of the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong move at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the US legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft for financial support.
Another threat is that other countries would be affected by the break-in.
A U.S. stock bloodbath
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 billion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators ignored the call of President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush's view would regulate the basic causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilise the whole economy.
The U.S. shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important stock indices recorded the biggest break-in in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, a similar break he had recorded last year in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was hardly any sign that the draft would not pass through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free case.
Congress grants: US government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
This will be agreed at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators reached a breakthrough in negotiations on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid for the US financial system in an amount of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 billion crowns).
However, this does not mean victory yet.
The congressional members must negotiate a few more details of the agreement before they can publish the final text of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system is negotiated at the US Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, of the Reuters Agency, said this.
In the Senate, according to different indications, it could probably be agreed on the plan earlier on Wednesday.
According to economics, the plan should be adopted as the first important psychological factor for the survival of financial markets.
But then it comes to a "deception" because of the complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice too.
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have explained our different views on how a package for the stabilisation of the market should be seen," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi compared to Agent Bloomberg.
According to your words, there could still be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the sale of non-trading mortgage assets by financial corporations that seriously damage financial firms and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We stand at the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we are on target," said Paulson.
A signal for Asia business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling heavily.
According to the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislator was trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday at the congress.
This is why it is necessary to put investors at ease in the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a conference decision could affect businesses on Monday.
Until now, however, it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress are voting on the law, and it is also unclear whether the negotiations in the last minute could not fail to deal with a problem.
The legislators hope it will be adopted in the coming days.
But there will be some changes to the law.
The total amount of aid for the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars will be provided as soon as possible as President George Bush requested.
However, the congress can block the cost of the rest of the money if it feels that the program does not fulfil its function, namely in the case of another $100 billion and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush values progress in negotiations
Although the President has a veto in this decision, the Congress can vote for his veto.
In spite of these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme remains to obtain funds for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, which have been lost, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, then on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The US President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His speaker Tony Fratto explained that Bush was pleased with the progress of Saturday and "estimate the mutual effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Low display volume limit
The chairman of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the leading retailer, agreed that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law also restricts the so-called gold case screens for directors of companies involved in the programme and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
This will be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and have made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also calculates with the help of homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages that it purchases, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Mark: Psychological Aid
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's why, because you don't know what mechanism and what price the problem assets are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share each other's losses," Marek told the iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week, it is not effective in Marek's view.
"It is much more important that the Congressional Members agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that it comes to an agreement is at this point the most important," said Marek.
Due to knife cutting: MP3 player against phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile MP3 file can play, no MP3 player can call yet.
That's why, of course, it looks like it's better to buy just one phone.
Still, there are sufficient reasons why you should be a independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims to the future owners.
I'm sure it's hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical news does not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is also no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Type Rock, Jazz or Blues in the regal, you probably dream of at least one of these.
So it is also simplified with music on travels, so with compressed music, - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, but a Pink Floyd fan will probably be heavily powered by headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play a lot more than just music, but what mobiles can do doesn't even make them crazy.
No modern device is to use as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the Simsen, it can play music and videos, both recording, it has a better, a worse camera, and maybe it can also navigate.
And if you even involve the smartphones and communications, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little wonder, because no fridge can grill and no TV camera.
But the universality of phones also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the more often you will have to download it.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy frescos.
Only a few phones can play music for more than twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, Music Player (especially the simplest) is significantly more powerful.
That's why you should count on the cheap phones so they can't play music for more than a few hours.
If you're off and still on the phone, you'd rather buy another charger for the office - that's also true for expensive devices.
In MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keep at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one upload.
There's another problem if you want to play the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the device has a USB connection, and no phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly on a storage medium, but only a few card reader devices will be finished without reduction with the small memory cards used in phones.
For players you do not need special software until exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players themselves use a music library, arranged according to the name of the performer, the album title, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only form the structure of the address list, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, phones can more
In selecting a specific device, you should examine yourself especially after the lifetime of the battery, storage capacity, quality and sound type, and of course also the operating comfort.
If music is especially cool for you and you listen to it every day just for example on the road, then enough any phone that plays MP3 files.
What can almost any cell phone really do.
You also don't have to check which music formats can handle a phone or a player.
MP3 creates all, and most of the music you get will be just in this format.
The format is one of the most widely distributed, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that uses Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow the purchase of music online.
You only need to call on mobile Internet the corresponding pages of a provider (or other provider), and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can already be a striking argument for why you should make a musichandy.
Unfortunately, the offer of suppliers is bad and usually only limited to fast radio hots.
The prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, this type of music sale (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) is expected to dominate the music industry in the future.
The phone wears most of it.
If you like to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket bag while the player forgets to stay at home.
However, it is important that you always carry headphones or at least a wireless free speech device.
If you don't, you can go back to the integrated speaker, with almost every phone, but only the smallest MP3 player.
Perhaps the greatest advantage of musichandys will be in the price for many.
The cheapest costs normally less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns, you'll already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest disability will be for most that there are no normal headphones.
The best and technically suited phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player is in the easy operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity with the previous normal tape recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
It does not threaten collision in the form of a reasonably used mobile Internet and then a shocking bill for data transmissions.
Which device should be taken now
Also the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But be careful.
In the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are generally supported.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already have a phone and want to buy another valuable MP3 player, then get to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Among the more demanding listeners, you prefer to take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate function buttons for MP3, and the operating comfort comes from one single MP3 player.
At the most, here is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individual MP3 players sold.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is well-equipped and the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as well as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
However, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics to lower prices.
Perhaps it will not be allowed to wait any longer.
The fact that the Czech mobile phone providers are working at the most expensive in Europe, we have often reported on mobile.cz.
This also confirmed the ČTù Telecommunications Authority, which pointed out that the price for a SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming charges, it is likely that there will be a paradox situation - for some Czech mobile customers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really makes a struggle.
Maybe it sounds paradox, but in Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100 %.
On the other hand, mobile operators would like to boast that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market.
The President of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who has often said in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with a network of its own has no more than many chances (otherwise he would probably not even find any frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
In particular, the entry of virtual providers into the mobile phone market brought a significant price reduction, which the classic mobile providers had to respond to.
Before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices on the market in the United Kingdom as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
Besides, you don't have to look for examples for long.
In February, we reported on the start of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus raise to the country's fifth largest provider.
Behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group, which has, among other things, U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to work effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers are usually defined as low-cost companies - they offer cheap telephone conversations and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers at least half cheaper SMS than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to set an unclievable target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"A real guy chooses Mobilking - the provider they like and who they can trust," says David Seibert, the CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept could occur in Poland as well as in the Czech Republic.
It also doubts the press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepýk: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively narrowed from the point of view of the service offer."
In Czech Republic, no chance, the mobile phone providers
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile phone provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look forward to it.
It will come rather to a market entry of Mobilking in other countries of our region," says Jana Studničková, press speaker of the Penta Finance Group.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile phone providers in the Czech Republic are not only attracted to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to ensure that there is no potential competitor.
Its interest at the start of a virtual mobile phone provider has long been shown by the group GTS Novera, who wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the business sector.
"We have a great interest in offering not only fixed network, but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this option with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already been able to make progress in the negotiations," said the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe better times come now.
Non-official information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this point, we do not assume that there is a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sršeň, in his statement for Mobil.cz from the press department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specificities of the Czech market.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds, in rare accordance with the statement of O2: "We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build further."
And she adds: "In the network of T-Mobile, a virtual provider will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this point, we had to have a concrete offer to be able to think in such a short time."
Vodafone focuses on meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepýký says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is precisely what we see from the customer's perspective as the best.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is looking for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
The behaviour of mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider called more competition, which would lead to lower prices and thus also to a fall in profits.
So why should it be made easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
That suppliers can draw on a string when it comes to something, it also lays down the long slope and everything about the origin of U:fon.
Perhaps the strongest pressure towards ČTù went the time when U:fon came to the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This is also the public information available from the ČTÚ website.
Now, however, you just need to use U:fon as an argument, why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile phone provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile radio market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services."
However, in view of this approach by mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTù, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries - does not have the power to intervene in economic competition.
It has only the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
But this related to this whole problem his very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after a contract between a mobile provider and a virtual provider has come to a conclusion on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not interesting enough for the classic suppliers," according to our inquiry Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS.
The representatives of the suppliers would not be surprised by such a formulation.
From an authority that represents consumer interests and should, among other things, take into account that no one abuses its position on the market, this is more than worrying.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual providers work quite normally, it is to be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, it is likely that the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction do not belong to the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, it is really shocking that the almost already rotating connection of the three mobile phone providers is derived from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just an accident is at hand.
Just as the absolute same fuel price in the tankers is certainly only a coincidence and the result of a hard competition struggle.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs in this case which have been the object of anti-competitive actions, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way on the matter.
None of the providers have a dominant market position, so neither does it have the corresponding increased responsibility for its operations on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening the mobile phone market for virtual providers are probably also lacking by the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by the ČTÚ, which, from the point of view of economic competition, is a single market.
On such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators have a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the consent of the network operator is always necessary for the market entry of a virtual provider.
And the mobile phone provider has, logically, the monopoly for its network.
This means that he necessarily assumes a dominant position in a particular segment.
Even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting similarly.
In so doing, there are a number of interested parties (including the company GTS Novera) who complain that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The deceleration of responsibility to ČTÚ is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services that distances the ÚOHS from the whole issue.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to implement the recently adopted telecommunications law's novelty to extend the ČTÚ's competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this only too well, but they probably have different interests.
It's all right if no one's looking.
The operation of any pseudovirtual providers, of which there are also several in the Czech mobile networks, is not observed.
There are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but only part of them are public.
This is usually the case for companies operating in the multilevel marketing sector.
For example, mobile telephone services offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies are usually only selected.
The funny thing is that the company appears to be a classic company, which orders a lot of SIM cards.
As an important customer it will then receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar similar type of sale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be an infringement of the contractual conditions with which we will then be involved, which can lead to the termination of cooperation with the company concerned," Martina Kemrová answered our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not happen to mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such an action.
The activities of these companies do not cause them to lose their profits, while at the same time, unlike actual virtual suppliers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepýky notes on possible problems: "The law allows such kinds of speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a very low percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card does not run on their behalf in their phone, so they cannot have full access to it as normal customers of mobile phones."
However, the ČTù had to at least appear strange.
There is also another question for the UOHS.
Do mobile phone providers close their eyes before such a procedure, why do they block against a virtual provider?
It is added that the UOHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not, it does not have to be satisfied with the supplier's statement, they knew nothing about it and their business conditions would prohibit it.
When Czech is no longer the most expensive
As already stressed in the text several times, the market entry of virtual providers brought a significant drop in prices for the various services.
In this way virtually all countries where virtual providers have been created have tried to prevent their origin from virtually more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a too small, or too highly-intended market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
However, in the highly developed countries, the regulatory bodies are currently taking action, which are not in any way interested in mobile phones, but are trying to be true to their customers.
Whether it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator was created, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing themselves at the whole case like a hot potato.
In the light of our experience, we cannot escape the impression that uncertainty in the skills in these cases is more than beneficial.
But we don't throw the flint into the oven.
If the background information agrees and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile phone market may be moving again soon.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile phone provider, the UOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other stakeholders (to discriminate).
And then the Czechs will finally no longer call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Sky.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented on the occasion of the day of the Czech state in a festival the new recordings of the National Gymne Where is my home country.
The Hymne was again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlávek.
Four versions are available - with male or female sologna, in corporal and in an instrumental version.
The song was taken by Katerzyna Kniežinková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of Hymnen versions are Otakar Jeremáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can hear all four versions at once.
For Bělohlávek the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier he had told the Czech radio, he had chosen the solo-variant singer with young, representative voices that are marked and popular.
"From the beginning, I have tried with both and then also with the chorus to keep a clear dictionary so that you can understand the text well so that a harmony can be formed," said the director.
The Czech National Gymnamne will begin its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde homev můj won for the first time in 1834 at the stage of the stage of the stage in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Til, the music originated by František Škroop.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first strofe of the song then became an organic part of the National Hymne after the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
Who sounds the "new" Hymne
The Prague transport companies transport on Wednesday for the first time also on a chip
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, a date will be entered in the history of the Prague transport companies as a date on which the first passengers who carry an electronic coupon in the bag instead of a paper ticket will enter a metro, road or bus.
These can now buy about a hundred thousand people who own the chipcard Opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or an annual coupon (just starting on 1 January 2009) and play on their chips at the same time, in the info centres and branches of the transport companies at the U-Bahn Stations Museum, Móstek, Nádraži Holeshovice, Andel, Rostyly, Letňany, Kobilisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The Coupons have been available on the Internet since yesterday at www.dpp.cz.
The service was applied to over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use Internet sales can really forget the output window in the metro stations, where they had to wait regularly in long hoses for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"In these places, travellers also have a switch with trained staff, who advises interested people on the Internet and also plays the coupon on the map," said the speaker of the Martin Opatrny project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on the open-card machine, which are placed in some U-Bahn-Vestibules.
How do such machines look?
They are red, recalling drivers, the passengers may have already noticed them at the bus stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"At the moment there are five of them in the city until the end of the year, but it should be eighteen," adds Opatrny.
The coupon controls an automatic instead of the driver
The operation of the automatics that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You just have to insert the chip card, and the coupon you previously purchased is playing on itself.
The electronic coupons are not only valid from tomorrow in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburbs and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants from the municipalities of the region reached the capital.
"In the trains that are part of the Prague integrated traffic, train crews have read-only devices that allow them to check the validity of the Coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization. This organization combines the roadmaps for the Prague transport companies.
The pre-city buses have card reading devices on the box at the driver.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown on the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked position on the side of the box.
This allows the driver to control the validity of the played coupons.
"If a driver wants to check the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver to request this information," said Drápal.
A driver who does not drive with pre-city buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can go back to the self-driving machines where the coupons are played on the map.
Here the information about the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The South asked the United States for a national decision
In 1945, the Germans had requested the division of the Bohmerwald into the United States.
This comes from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, a number of groups of Germans were to have joined the U.S. presidents in 1945.
This comes from, among other things, a letter that is kept in a private archive and that is kept in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the US President in his letter that he should not allow the return of the "Suddenhaus" - which was adopted on the basis of the Munich agreement by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to make sure that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as free people," it says in a letter that is signed by the words "People who are at the heart of the Sudan".
Since the accession of the Czech Republic to the Czech Republic - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - suggests that they would expect brutality, intolerance, lack of understanding, oppression, and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the Presidents to take over the Böhmerwald forever and today and forever.
"We cannot believe that you have given a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area to a foreign state that has oppressed and tried to eliminate minorities and has not even contributed anything to the victory of the Allieds," is read in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is apparently the fear of the "Czech underpressors".
If the U.S. President is in doubt about the opinion of the Böhmerwalddeutschen, it would be sufficient if he in Böhmerwaldgau initiated a national decision on whether the inhabitants of the United States become part of the United States or would live under the protection of the United States.
However, while the text of the letter in today's knowledge of post-war history may sound somewhat naive, in the opinion of some historians it is a good picture of the expectations of the Sudanese people.
Even though the Bohmish Germans had to admit that they were going to negotiate their departure from the Republic, only a few of them stood up to this possibility at all.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudan.
Others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as Budweiser Deutscher at the Marine at the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British prison at the end of the war and was taken to a prison in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him, he was to give them the Czech language.
"They believed, if they came home, they would be able to fit the Czech," says Chalupa.
No one of the German prisoners of war who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia thought that it would be distributed from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - then pay!
An emotional campaign is directed at drivers
The most expensive action for road safety in Czech history.
The emotional campaign was also characterized by the media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Aleš Rébíček promises to take drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, on radio, on the cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to take the drivers from too fast driving and alcohol to the tax.
And they also remember to take a look at the entrance.
The campaign focuses on young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians, and not least professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
It also proves the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "do not think" are in capital letters on a sign sign.
And in a blood vessel, the word "pay".
This should mean that one can pay for a moment of carelessness with his own life.
The spots will be "choking" the spectators by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the English-speaking countries, where you can see pictures with dramatic images of victims of accidents.
It is promised that such accidents and the number of traffic accidents on the Czech streets will fall.
The spots were compiled by Euro RSCG.
Sugar beet and peits for motor vehicles
"For the riders, the motto applies sugar bread and peitsche.
It means saving time when driving at red, for example.
The petticoat is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver needs to be reminded of the risk," said the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that's why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are necessary, says psychologist.
Even less effective are his opinion on tables that make drivers aware of a danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns against a danger, it will probably soon run away with the environment, and the drivers will no longer see it," says Koríán.
Olmert would give back almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, spoke of the return of practically all the areas occupied in 1967, including the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan hills, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He stressed this in an interview that was printed on Monday by Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to give back almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert said about the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israeli) because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that any return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The person who wants to be safe in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozer to roll over his legs as one of my best friends has to ignore a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in an adjournment of two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and holy and historic places" located on the territory of the old city.
"The one who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Subtraction of the Golan heights
Olmert spoke of a withdrawal from the Golan hills of Israel, which he saw as an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require certain efforts on the sides of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude with Syria alone and alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan-High Peace," Olmert confirmed.
"The Syrians only know too well what they have to give up in order to get back the Golan hills.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shiitian) Hisbollah movement; they will have to give up their ongoing support to the terrorism of (Shiitian) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the Dshihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know her, in a remote bus the tour is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and travelers can go on and on the bus during the trip.
"If we want to adhere strictly and formally to the law, then the activity of a Steward is contrary to the road traffic law," said the speaker of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, last week, when a two-year-old Stewardness came to life, was probably caused by the driver of the LKW, who crossed the bus.
The young woman sat at this moment in all the accident next to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, although she had two more seats available.
But a bus can also have an accident at the moment or a sharp brake in which Steward brings coffee or newspapers.
A role also plays whether the bus is equipped with the vehicle letter even with parking spaces.
If this is not provided in the bus, the passengers must be seated.
The Student Agency's remote travel buses have no seats; as confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Janchura, compared to Aktuální.cz.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry, and this has not initially agreed to the movement of travellers.
This has been withdrawn later, and we have reached a consensus on which travellers may go to the toilet during the trip if they have their seat," he told his position.
The law doesn't know a Steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a Steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation which prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the term 'vehicles'; however, it does not define its rights and obligations', says Hanzelka, the speaker of the Ministry of Transport.
On the other hand, the Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorny, believes that the law covers this issue in the afternoon.
"It is clear whether the bus in the product authorisation also has parking spaces.
That's all," he stresses.
Buses are divided into urban buses where there are parking spaces and the maximum speed is limited, busses with parking spaces and a higher permitted speed and distance buses without parking spaces with the maximum permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP specialist for traffic safety Jaroslav Horín does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid vehicle, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Even here is not safe when turbulence comes, and Stewardess can hit his head."
"But if a bus is hard, then the laws of physics are also applicable.
Just like in the city bus or in a road.
The safety of Stewards must be clarified by internal regulations," he says and also believes that this problem from the point of view of the law is not fully resolved.
Janchura is ready to provide services
Student Agency offers Stewards services as the only bus company.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider his profession as risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that Steward's profession is risky, I'm going to beat it.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by travellers when entering.
That would also reduce the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin is justified by the lack of Stewards in his bus. But his company only operates a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have Stewards, but we've been fighting from the beginning.
sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident," he had not spoken a whole year ago for Týden.cz.
This was an incredible tragedy.
In the case of a line bus to Naples, a young Steward was disappointed in the Pilsen region, which had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian LKW was probably bent off the stand and had blocked the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid a sharp manoeuvre, but collided with the right advantage with the LKW.
That the two seats were sold for the Stewards, Janchura argues.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
The company will declare LKW masters.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the judgment, but it also expects a financial compensation from the debtor.
A change in the law?
Not visible
A more precise regulation on the movement of Stewards on board a bus could bring a statutory regulation that has been working for over a year on a thirty-six-head team of experts from the Ministry of Transport.
"However, this has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of phones on the road," says Fachmann Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider Steward's activity as a matter of fact that could seriously endanger the safety of travellers," says Hanzelka, where the control of the safety of buses lies within the competence of the police and the labour protection authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, the letter from the WestLB board does not leave the employees of the house.
Through a merger of units of the Düsseldorf Money Institute with the Frankfurter Deca Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen financial group", it is said to be written on Monday.
The WestLB uses a "competence block" with sustainable yield power in such a business.
And at all times such a connection of the decisive attack on further mergers in the national banking sector could be.
This is how it is read when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult time.
Because the affected WestLB is still under severe pressure.
Not only since the EU Commission, but also through the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Agency, which the North Rhine-Westphalia Government has just made it clear that it is time to find a future solution.
From an ever-like connection between the Deka bank, which is known to savings customers because of their investment funds, and the WestLB has been speaking - even on Frankfurter side for some time now.
Although Deka-Bank-Chief Franz Waas has known in the presentation of the half-yearly figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a national bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, he doesn't see any sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deca, which is held in half by the Land Banks and the Stock Exchange Associations, has commissioned the Board to conduct discussions with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could involve the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks are free, that is, in the financial square, just started.
The Deka Bank, which is one of the most important employers in the financial sector in Frankfurt, is not the first time in terms of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed as if the Deka bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
But nothing came from this triangle.
The plans had hardly been public, the Hessian government opposed the participation of Helaba.
The two other houses were not found together either.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart instead.
However, it has always given thought to a connection between the Deka Bank and national banks.
Last time, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the board of the Helaba, had spoken against planning to join his house.
Regardless of this, however, it seems to be true that there is a need for a collapse of the different homes of the public-law sector.
After the country day election in Bavaria has passed, the first thing the BayernLB could do is to get closer to the Baden-Württemberg Landesbank.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily a good message.
If pressure increases to further mergers, you will go to and to the partners for it.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has so far experienced the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, a connection with the West LB has been established by the Hessen-Thüringen-Sparkasen-Giroverband, which is 85 percent involved in Helaba, at the beginning of the year.
By the way, stay the North LB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of individual houses fit together.
In June Merl expressed the crucial question of which business model to ensure the future of the Landesbanks was not answered by the German Sparkassen-Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a breakdown of the West LB, which is not, however, desirable there.
This is also the case in the letter of the Board of Directors of the European Communities, and in any case a "general solution" will be sought for the house.
As with the merger of individual units with the Deka bank, it will still show itself.
The second weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luca, the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is like his girlfriend with it, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beerfat of the brand Kaiser, a massively built carrier stands and proves the approximately 200 October holiday travelers, which deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena's just giving Luca a cup, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus park next to Puorta Nuova Train Station, will start at 23.45 am four buses, "Destinazione Monaco, festa della brewa", expected arrival 6.30 pm.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, only Brazilians travel on a bus.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they've celebrated already at night.
And so says Marco Guarda, it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with a pellet feed and a glasses with broad silver straps, belongs to the bus.
For five years they've been driving to October, three tours are alone this year.
At night, day after day on the display, at 22.30 a.m. back.
Nighttime would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
75 Euros costs the ride, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Bier, used faithfully to offer the Bavarian cleanup, the health insurance and the German-speaking travel guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And the buses are already rolling in the night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
It will soon be quiet in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where there are also several other buses with Italian signs on the highway 8 shortly before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at half an hour early in the parking lot near the Theresienwie, they are already on the other 50 buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco holds a final address, explains the attack plan.
First, set up the yellow button.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in Fracture, including the Internet address of Marcos Travel Office: "conscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "If the doors go up to the beerselt, it's running!", Marco called in the morning.
"Run!" ran and placed the places in the back of the tent.
"Not on the front, otherwise we block, and not all yellows on the same bench, spread in the room!"
The size, Brells Marco, costs 8.25 Euros.
And don't forget your drinking money.
"The security people show that we're doing well!
They will be gone as soon as you leave your homes."
Third, "This evening, the point of eleven will be found again here!"
And it's going to be fair.
On the way, a yellow hat binds as a roadmark to the trees, to paintings and even to the electorate of a large Bavarian folk party.
You want to be armed for the retreat.
It's the second weekend, known as "Italian weekend".
There are no precise figures; the talk is 50 000, which are on the way over the Alps and in the beer fields, ten percent of all visitors are to be extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol policemen, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a national statistics, in which the Italians before the British (about 60) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies are the first place.
Especially popular with Italians is the Court of Justice.
Sleepless nights for believers of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, said German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
As it is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also implied that the German banking sector will not be removed from the critical developments.
For this is now the time of the weekend.
The Münchner Real Estate Financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) noted in Dax receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to shield themselves from the turbulence in the markets.
One person familiar with the situation said on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The hipo Real Estate should only be the part which it also claims.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is loss at the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which he has borrowed money, the financier has been extremely short-term refinancing - which is no longer possible due to the mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's stock exchange had dropped by 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had slightly increased from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current earnings and net earnings from financial transactions fell to zero over the previous year's period, revenues from deposits for claims and certain securities and from the resolution of deposits in the credit business fell by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
Only through higher income from the replacement of deferred costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the repayment of interest after the payment order and from the business provision for group companies had the yield minus of about 16 per cent remained moderate.
The former state financeer had first speculated after his privatisation in 1990 with commercial real estate loans, which were then distributed in the Aareal Bank.
Due to the lack of value in classical state funding, the Depfa had then increased in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects by private investors and the State (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate now has to write down which will have a "essential material effect" on the profit and loss of the group, it is quite uncertain.
The fact is, the dividends were deleted.
It has already been cut by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major public and infrastructure financeer since Depfa took over.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing on the interbank market, as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending among the banks is much promised again, as the banks heard their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a part - about 50 billion euros - of the Depfa credit portfolio of short-term funds for refinancing each year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the group's funding needs are covered with the credit at a time that is available and the company is protected "from the influence of the current largely inefficient international money markets".
From other sources, it is to be heard that, thanks to the money, refinancing is secured by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE President Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to apply for the cash markets at the time available.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Agency (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now guaranteed.
This is hoped for by shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But in view of the dynamics and impatience of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even inevitable that funding should not be fully implemented.
But also the opposite is not to be ruled out.
After the company was still in insolvency at the latest Sunday night, at least the temporary rescue will not be able to calm the hostages.
The share price falls by 75 per cent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, the borrowing rates are quite good.
If the priority debts are not shown to be moving, the rates of the second-hand bonds are more clearly stated.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, of course, the maturitys that went beyond 2009 are concerned.
As a speculative investment option, the hypo-real-state bonds themselves must be valued after the significant deterioration of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only taken over the depfa crisis, as the stability of the international financial system would have to be considered.
As long as the notary banks, governments and less-adjusted business banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to spend a reasonable amount of time on the rent.
Or it will take place what is not yet expected of anyone - that the financial crisis will be overrun in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the announcements made by the sub-State, the likelihood of safety-limits has now become only a legitimate hope.
In particular, long-term creditors should prepare some sleepless nights with the decision to separate themselves from their commitments.
However, short-term investors can use a profit margin to create a loss rate for future tax payments on price gains later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to present himself at the Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start to kiss: The German is total "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log tells her from Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had Bammel before school.
I live on the border of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and spend 40 minutes on the train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way by myself, and luckily I didn't.
The beginning of teaching does not appear to be as strict as we do at home in Lower Saxony.
From eight o'clock, the students interfere until about twenty-nine a short round of discussion begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the teaching started, I was on the line to introduce myself.
I am not the type who likes to talk to people, even before a class of 40 students.
Because I had not yet had a school uniform, I wore an old dress of my mother's guest, such as blouse, blue knee drops and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator, I put myself in front of the powder and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm Sylvana, come from Germany and have a week of birth.
At the moment I was very happy that I had started to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all exchanged, squeaked and chewed and I have heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the survival of Japanese girls and means 'neglect, sweet'.
Then I'm in my place fast.
The girl next to me was quite large, she found it an honor for the exchange student to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was rather quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was regularly shaken.
They all talked through each other and kuched and asked me holes in the belly - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the pause, all of her bentos were taken out.
My guest mother had made me such a lunch box - this is a little different from the old German breaks.
I had rice with herbs, small herbs, salad made from mushrooms and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumantel.
I don't usually have any blond scissors, which is exactly what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
I'm sure everything's really nice.
Well, up to the salty flowers, maybe, brrr!
Bentos are not just lunch in Japanese schools.
Sometimes it appears that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which then makes her especially artificial - in the hope of getting to know the boys at the break.
That's what I read in my Manga comics.
I'm kind of excited to see this too.
'Why calculated Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me now."
After all, I've been reading Mangas for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and culture there, I also started to learn a little Japanese.
So it was clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a weak for tradition, seats and breaks.
And that's what you put great value on here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not lost myself here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
Does a rat or a sheep fly at risk mean that it is also afraid?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Just how can you test whether they feel the same way if they behave like us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has published a number of years of contributions by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers in a series to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness conditions, without me or anyone else proving this so far, where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we should at least hope that all human brains will have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we apply other species and cut out questions of the feeling or in general of consciousness, we enter uninhabited areas because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is at risk, it does the same thing as many other animals: it dies, flies, or attacks.
People behave similarly to what some scientists conclude on a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
For one, the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the side frontal cortex (due to its participation in the short-term memory and the performance/control functions).
This vast region is much higher in humans than in the other primates and seems to be lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to assume that man is even different from the other primates.
Another type of drama may lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be, would probably differ much from most of our consciousness-states.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness may appear in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, neither measure nor, because of the special hardware, can be analysed on our own experience, then his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my performances relate to the content of the most conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically easier to access.
The consciousness processes of animals could be examined regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, in this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one refers rather to the neural correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the state of visualization.
What happens now to the feelings?
I bring them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a conscious brain in its own activity.
What we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, like physical reactions) is stored.
In this way, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, the primates and in particular the people.
Related to the language nature are fine degrees of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar, we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings of more primitive activity in the regions of the cortex and the brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network did not change much during human evolution, it could be fully involved in cross-border feelings.
Theoretically, I can't resist it, but it's unmistakable.
Pankseep argues that what appears in rats and people like fear is likely in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and people feel the same when they behave the same way?
Does a sheep flee in danger if it is also afraid?
In my eyes, only behaviorality can still not prove the same as experience.
While the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain stems, sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it to people: how did you want to prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (we know?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuit and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress is being made here at the neural level, provided that the same is true for rats and humans.
As I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, neither do I feel, but I don't know if they exist.
You may keep this brief, but I'd rather go ahead than walk against a wall all the time.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Gnadenterm für Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to hold the EM together with Poland," Vasjunik said.
"But that's not amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or refurbishment of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts go back.
Perhaps even the number of EM stages is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work at the highest speed," said Ukrainian Federation President Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep us in the eye constantly."
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association PZPN has been suspended following numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation of the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several initialists were convicted only in the past season because of manipulation for forced retirement, and eventually even the start of the league had to be moved in a short time.
Touched Dennis Quaid Puts Back
She wanted to promote a new film, she spoke in the interview about privacys - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan out of her scary Dennis Quaid as a marriage breaker.
He's shy - and he hits back.
Late Rosen war at the former spouse Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unparalleled dispute with each other - in all public.
Meg Ryan had first expressed himself in an interview with the U.S. newspaper InStyle last week for the reasons for breaking the marriage: "This was a long time of untrustworthyness, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud has only led them to experience after the divorce.
The occasion for the soul stripping was Ryan's presswork for her new film "The Women" - tells the story of a marriage break.
Dennis Quaids' reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband fell out: "Unfortunately," said 54-year-old New York Daily News, that "Meg once again resells and covers the story of our relationship".
It would also be "depressive", that the 16-year-old son Jack will again be "publicly reminded of the pain and changes that mean a separation for every child."
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently father of twins.
And so close his introductions with the page title: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family that is doing well."
Prices for flight tickets and hotels down
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper according to a current study of up to 50 percent.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have again become more profitable - this is the result of a study by the American Express Travel and Financial Service provider.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant break in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays have already been approved in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of 48 European cities were still on average 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most significant trend in Paris and Rome was where travellers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year earlier.
For this reason, American Express sees the weak dollar course that led to a "absorbing travel of American tourists".
Financial positions such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices are increasing by 26.3 percent even keeping the record in Europe.
In the first quarter, the trend was also shown above:
Because of the kerosene pollution, passengers in the economy class had to pay more than 7.1 percent than 2007, fuel intensive long-distance flights were even 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for tickets from the economic class decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but price changes in the business and first class were significantly lower.
In Germany, prices are even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March prices increased by 11.9 percent, by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
According to the study, the prices were even halved on German domestic flights.
On the one hand, the company explains the reason for the rise in prices.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market broke down.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure through the Open-Skies Agreement which liberalises air transport between the US and Europe.
Signs of the tense situation were the elimination of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had registered the first half of 2008 competition - these were 24 airlines alone in Europe.
HSV hit Gladbach 1:1
With a door and simple methods, the Hamburger SV will lead the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning Elf.
From Kristofer Klein enlarge fracture landing for national players Marko Marin.
The gladbacher just got into the game and escaped with a lift to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she went convincingly about his lips.
He knew he was right.
"We need the second door," Hermann Rieger finished in the cabin passage of the Hamburg Arena.
Many were not isolated in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most sat back in their seats.
Rieger was almost three decades of physical therapy of the HSV, he enjoys a higher view than a more frightening actor.
And so his prayer was also heard in a responsible position.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nibbled and hopped the dome accordingly.
Cornelius is the brother of the Head coach Martin Jol of Hamburg.
Its command is similar: There are two gates!
The implementation remained unimplemented.
"It wasn't nice to see everything today," Marcel Jansen later said.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would've wanted to be more relaxed.
The 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburgers have to thank Mladen Petric's headball meeting (11); and the fact that very weak gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol together.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon the viewers celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the arena and the flashboards on the video wall, which proved their association as class premium.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to sort it out," said Marcel Jansen.
He notes that the tableware is more for the incompatibility of the league than for the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late obligatory access - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Torschütz Petric and the Jansen rejected by the FC Bayern - is slow but still unable to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol demanded.
After the vote
On the Wall Street, there's fear.
First news of the failure of the rescue package allowed Dow Jones to break in at 700 points in time.
This was the biggest point loss within a day in his history.
Later, the Dow started to do something again.

No title could be retrieved.
The shares of the Bank Goldman Sachs amounted to about ten percent.
Just a few days ago, Großinvestor Warren Buffett participated in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be provided for the purchase of so-called false mortgages.
The sum is to be paid, but not to a beat, but to a step.
On the contrary, the State should receive stock option cards from financial corporations that could be released in the event of appropriate price developments in order to reduce the burden on the State tax.
Stock exchange rates in Europe and the USA in the south-east
The billion aid to banks in Europe and the United States does not resolve the doubts raised by investors.
The share rate of the German Grand Bank Hypo Real Estate breaks down and climbs down the dax.

Dark matter affects flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been providing researchers with advice: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called Swing-by-Manover.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity, Albert Einstein, could not be quite correct.
Almost 18 years ago, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
Because of the soon-frozen fuel pipelines, you are now threatened with cold death.
For years, scientists have provided a mysterious phenomenon for confusion - the Swing-by-Anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flightover of space probes, where they receive additional vibrations in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Research Sonde Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sun Sonde Ulysses.
What the researchers have been wondering about, however, for years: The air bodies do not behave 100 percent as expected by the ancient gravity law.
More often, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter through a distortion of space, could not be quite correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still believes that Einstein is not mistaken, and tries to explain the Swing-by-Anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have developed in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
Of the existence of the dark matter, space researchers have known for about ten years.
It is obviously an attractive force whose effect on other celestial bodies can be seen.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
After the calculations of the scientists, however, the dark matter makes good a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists exported to Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists who were trapped in Egypt will be released again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The exporters from Sudan had asked for several million euros of money.
In the case of a shooting before release, six hostages were to be killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Remuneration negotiations are already under way.
Germans have always returned to the Visier of Kidnappern.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
The European tourists who were dragged into the Sahara are obviously free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV station Al-Arabia and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports of the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We're just checking her health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian, and their eight Egyptian companions, were well and in safety, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are to be on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for a shooting remain unclear before the hostages are released: Thus, the kidnappers were prepared, according to an Egyptian security officer, to terminate the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the officer said.
It was "just gone to receive the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers and two of them were arrested on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The hostages had demanded a six-million-euro ransom from Germany; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported on a call to a German mediator who delayed the release of the hostages because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the exporters want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom money.
Men should be detained as long as the kidnappers have a safe flight route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Misuse of the stepfather "leaded to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather led to the murder of a woman, a court was reported.
Michael Treise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after he had suffered eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Court of Justice in Truro found that he regularly imprisoned his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Treise wrote in a statement: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Mrs Randle moved to her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Treise had wrapped her eyes and tied her eyes before he performed sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a guesthouse.
Treise and his wife were divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
The Court found, however, that Mrs Randle, who worked for a large part of her time in honor of the National Trust, was persecuted for abuse which she had been added twice a week.
State attorney Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs Randle, who had been an eerie surfer and biker, had been "emotionalally dead" and "give up her life" since 2006
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she killed herself by squeezing herself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of conscience, who ended up saying, "I watched her shut up and tie her eyes."
"I didn't need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Treise: "They are an extremely fearsome fetishist and it must have been terrible for her sacrifice, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would be brought before the court if it had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the effects that Stephanie's father and mother had on her daughter over the years, according to a description of her father and mother.
She would otherwise have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officer responsible for lost data is charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet officer who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June will be charged under the Public Security Act.
The man was seconded by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would have been the case within the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be named shall be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the safe storage of information.
The Royal Public Prosecutor recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he presented included classified reviews about Al-Qaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs in the eye
According to the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank, British housing companies could cost more than 80 million pounds in the house.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies receiving the money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "indecent", that companies and their members should pay.
The 14 billion loans will finally be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are paid.
However, the interest charged in the interim is calculated each year to the 700 financial undertakings that accept the deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted prudently ... are now called to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company had to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies had to pay around 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on the loan will rise to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that the companies have to buy 81 million pounds for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Housing Association, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted prudently during the property increase will now be called up to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less careful.
According to the BSA, no company has been registered since the year 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 will cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 interest rates will fall for a full year and this could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are both non-society organisations, their members will either be required to pay for the costs by higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre
The people on Jersey are confronted with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk for another five pence per litre of Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after an investigation of a consulting company has been carried out.
The retailers themselves should decide whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the increase in prices in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was changed last year in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a request for bail by former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Their defenders said that the Court of Justice had refused to have pressed 50 million Taka ($729,700) in the case of a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Scheich Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released this month against bail.
Sheikh Hasina was to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-supported transitional government grant her unlimited freedom first.
Correspondents say that, although their detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of their release whether they will be able to continue on a free footing when they return to Bangladesh.
Your lawyers state that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court's decision.
"The Supreme Court has rejected the Sheikh Hasina's petition for bail because it says that she does not have to receive bail because she is already in prison abroad to be treated abroad," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We shall file a complaint against the Supreme Court."
Your lawyers insist that they need bail to return from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
It was expected that Sheikh Hasina would return home after 17 October, said an Awami Joint Chairman on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia lie to themselves.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-Polio initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence brought against the Taliban, so the United Nations.
The United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to one UN speaker, this was the case despite the promise of the Taliban that the thousands of personnel carrying out the vaccinations would not be attacked or prevented.
BskyB loses complaints in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing broadcaster ITV.
The competition court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB's share would distort competition and allow it to have a more unfair influence on the ITV broadcaster.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006, by converting NTL to Virgin Media, successfully preventing the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB was prepared to start an investigation on the independence of ITV, which the Competition Commission has moved to.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Office Ofcom have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that it wanted to give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. State Prosecutor's Office
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special mediator to deal with the termination of the nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The case was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice criticising the actions of the administrative staff.
The report criticised the officials of the Weissen House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Agent Nora Dannehy is now scheduled to clarify whether the officers interviewed during the investigation have angels to prevent justice.
Serious proposals including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special mediator with the power to force witnesses to speak was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began as the Ministry of Justice in December 2006 nine U.S. state counsels from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that public prosecutors would be dismissed because of poor work.
However, it was later found that the acquitted prosecutors were not worse judged than many of their colleagues, which prompted many observers to consider the advertisements as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking members of the Republican Congress, while others had refused to investigate the proposals on the election of the Democrats.
U.S. U.S. Attorneys are hereby ordered to investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government.
They may leave at any time, but they must not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Advocate General Alberto Gonzales, has come under arrest because of the dismissals and, in the end, has put down his office.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also announced.
In particular, the report by the Inspector-General has criticised the role of Gonzales by having the "main responsibility" for the dismissals, having given up his leadership role, and having shown himself to be "extremely disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including former Prime Minister Bush Karl Rove, were criticised for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song should be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award "Q Award" for its epic Hymne "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, the next week in London, will accept his special golden price during the award, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the song track to Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for the award this year after it has come into four categories in the closer selection.
The editor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such materials as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song that was composed by Jim Steinman demanded a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was published as a single in 1979 in Britain and reached place 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heart beats after he was broken up on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel the concerts due to an acute carbon leakage.
Later it was known that he had a bite on his voice band.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possible soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, alone, sideways and other surrounding roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
However, it is even difficult for experienced taxi drivers and long-term residents to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from the First Street towards the North between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and it looks more like a dusty gas than an active transit road.
There are no road signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road plan.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to create an extra place to create a clean journey to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
The other owners are part of the long-standing neighborhood, which says they are fascinated by the short gas, simply because it is one of the rest of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration department responsible for the protection and construction of residential buildings and responsible for the road has no interest in receiving them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Community this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay have proposed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers that the road remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted in the coming month, says Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the municipality 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers of how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street set up new floors and seats, which are intended for a café, to which the company would like to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to take advantage of the road, but it did not want to have it.
"The main concerns of Avalon Bay are to renew this missing gas and make it a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Building Protection Department, said that it was actually the wish of the city to sell the road and stressed that the task of the department was to develop the property rather than to manage it.
Compared to his colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of his historical impressions.
Some believe that the street received its name in 1802, when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow country was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk monument closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly best known as the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scraps, lamps and parts of fibers, posters, sheets and cables.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the genitalization of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to be public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rareness – a practically unchanged divider of the city that should be allowed to rest.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (titled "The Book of Complaints: A bitter nostalgic view of the dying city"), published a part of the city's story story about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, at that time wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow bag gas that remains dark even over the day and is marked by the ruined metal doors of the warehouse halls, closed windows and rainboards over the coming weeks."
With few exceptions, the road appeared just before an evening.
A rat passed through the back of the road, not far from the door that previously led to CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing business.
Graffiti was visible on the walls and an empty beer bottle was not far from a fresh bundle of arranged newspapers on the ground.
Some passengers said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be somewhat polished.
Field, added that, according to his opinion, some people underestimated the journey of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, moist and noble.
Two-language education debate: education in English-speaking environment
In this issue of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for dual-language training.
Lance T. Izumi, head of scientific staff in California Studies and head of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as well as you think: Why the middle class needs a school choice".
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barack Obama's suggestions on education are a typical example.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "probability for African-American and Hispanic students to successfully complete the school is lower than for white students" - which is correct.
In order to close this distance of performance, Obama's education plan specifically recommends a two-lingual transition phase in training for those who only learn English.
However, Obama's question is whether his use of two-language training, which puts the emphasis on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance in school services.
Take, for example, "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
Most of the students are Spanish and come from families with low income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
However, in 2008, a surprising 100 percent of fourth grade students had passed the state examination in Mathe on a good level.
Also surprising were 93 percent of children from the fourth school year in the English exam as well.
This amazing success was achieved by other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The School Sixth Street focuses on verification and exercise, on continuous control of knowledge and a attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
The school also practices the approach followed by training in an English-speaking environment. That is exactly the point Obama should take into account, so the school leader Linda Mikels.
This approach places value on the almost exclusive use of the English language in professional instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, who rejected the idea of two-lingual education, told me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later you would enter the classroom and no longer be able to recognize him.
"It works," she noticed, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-speaking students?
The services of the school would make the answer to this question easy, but the training policy positions within its own party (the national educational associations have long supported the idea of two-lingual education) and its own consistent support of the two-language training make predictions about Obama's response uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "English".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the distance of performance, he should take careful account of the models of education that work rather than fear them and trivialize them.
The price of oil decreases due to further fears about the economy
The oil price is high on Monday because of the fears that even the US rescue plan for the financial markets would not be able to relive the economy.
The oil terminals at the New York trade fair fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has been reduced by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shielded both by the financial turbulence on the Wall Street and by powerful waves in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices in July had reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month to increase again as a result of huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were once again concerned, although congress representatives had announced that they would have agreed on a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the greatest in history.
This message was overestimated by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been completed.
In the first chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, the Citigroup is expected to buy the banks of the Watchovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, it appears that despite the intense negotiations that took place this weekend and led to a rescue plan, it was not possible to survive the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Analysts of the Deutsche Bank have written in a communication to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the markets, we are most concerned about whether the US American virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank's analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the following year and have reduced their oil and gas prices by 20% for 2009.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Integrated Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything, after he had lived in Jets Trichot in the last eight and a half years more than anyone else.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned a resultless game into a triumph suit.
"That's what I've never seen," said Ellis.
After a vicious game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect rise to a afternoon on which their developing cooperation made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for two more touchdowns, which one time as an external defender and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half-life.
"I have not been particularly hard on myself," Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a superhero.
Our vote has been voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Cole were playing, the defense took Quarterback Kurt Warner apart.
Externally defensed Darrelle Revis started a deplorable dump and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and started it.
Linebacker David Bowens then took care of a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had won the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the jets pulled the ball back and Jay Feely turned a 20-yard shot to 34 to 0 leadership.
These were the most points the jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he prayed to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, replied "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
On the answers both, because the jets left 21 points in the third quarter without achieving one, Mangini said, "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time."
Exhausted Gableslase beats his world record
Haile Gebrasslassie from Ethiopia has shown again why some keep him for the best long distance of all time, after he broke his own record on Sunday in Berlin Marathon and became the first person to create the distance of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course at 2:03:59, Gebrslassie improved his previous score of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrslassia, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his diverse career, in which he has reached at least one world championship title or a world record on every track from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrslassie left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, fearing that air pollution might worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at the sun and 9 degrees at the beginning and 13 degrees at the target - have won a breecheslassion with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since train runners such as Gebrslassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have moved on long distances, the record time for Marathon in the last 10 years has fallen for more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, the press announced that he had two weeks ago had seizures in his vade and therefore could not train for a week.
Apparently, he was refreshed after a break and did not return to rest.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything is perfect.
I took the training back a week ago and had some more concerns today, but at the end of everything was great."
He was criticized for doing this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopian rivals from East Africa - that he was overly orchestrated, many of the world's best Marathonstars generally resented, rely too much on the race leaders as if it were a train race, and a world record about the competition.
However, this criticism hardly harms the size of the gerbslassies as long-term runners.
accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrslassie reached the center of the route at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrslassia after the tempomas left.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebraslassie made his last entry to separate from Kwambai, which came as second at 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became Third at 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Deutsche, has completed a remarkable year by showing at 2:19:19 the fastest result of all times.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the United Kingdom.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as a rear injury. However, she has recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon for five minutes.
She had planned her course by leaving a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to travel only, but only 30 kilometres away.
Ascale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as a third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the traps in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the expansion of leisure parks around Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, loud and gigantic drives, is a quiet city in which pride and the complications of African-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the town of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet squares, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it's a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of Harlem Renaissance.
And yet it is and remains the city that describes it – and it made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida Travel Guide, which was produced at the time of the depression of the federal writer project – in many respects a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is so independent and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what's going on with him."
Even today, in one year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, called for an open debate on racial relations, many are still sorry to be observed by outsiders here.
"We are very concerned about how our history is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a community member of the oldest church of the city.
You have to agree."
Eatonville has long been defined as the paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is a historical example of the black movement as well as a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate doubles as high as the country average.
On the one hand, it is a capital of literature and on the other hand an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south that has its roots in the American slavery.
It is not surprising that people here are both proud and on the hat.
And so correctly, the concerns about Eatonville's image began with Zora, as all Hurstons call it.
She introduced the world to her home town in books that came from hearts and were written in mouth, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Travel Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road leading through the often forgotten center of Florida to the shadows of black history and human drama.
Frech and Oscar both in real life and in literature, Hurston reader led to the loading of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Besides the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown, well-cut modern school, with its decorated gardens and playgrounds, which always cares about Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold all kinds of drinks and what-always fits into hours."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus linked Eatonville with self-esteem, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
"Zora described things the way they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls bled Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty that were full of sexual performances.
She added, "Many people don't like this."
You still remember Hurtson here as a lively eccentricist who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came to town, she did this mostly without warning, in a smoldering Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that today represents something on her precious style of dress.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated by what many of them despised.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added, while he was jumping in his chair, on a back-dwelling terrace overlooking the Sabelia lake, in which the Hurston of all probability was baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and buried her books.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous tomb.
In Eatonville, there were no large memorials, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their heritage in the wild," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The wind came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to set up a five-track highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-track main road of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the 4 motorway through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his history.
Compulsory integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought Hass into the Community.
"In this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting aside," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston asked in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel to force the Supreme Court to require integration by calling its decision in the Brown case against the school council as "respectingly respecting my race".
People today say that although the elimination of racial separation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group's content in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of its young people.
"Black children were used to becoming poor - I remember it - they were poor in the morning and they were poor in the evening," says N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and business director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"I didn't want his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural climate," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who have gone over prejudices, as they did, with positive self-consciousness and saying, "How can anyone deny the joy of my society?
I don't understand."
In 1975 the writer Alice Walker made his way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the restoration of her fame.
Five years later, a well-known Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshops, and again made it part of the American literary canon.
The remote street project came exactly at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in public light.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the municipality began planning a Hurston Festival to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its street construction projects.
"The plans of a five-passing distance led to the city, accelerated the whole with peak speed, aroused real citizens' shocks," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said something simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the road project has contributed to a change in the city's image.
There came more and more journeys, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to the church since 1993, and locals began to reassess the past.
Eatonville was admitted to the national historical register in 1998.
A new intrusive library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly bottled and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a specialty in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre of Orlandos can feel like a back gas in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is today 90% black.)
Foreigners looking for the story of Eatonville and its importance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, a prior approval is necessary and certain things - like the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a wiseman and represented by black men at field work - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that their protected community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew, an increased degree of homelessness was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and smooth, albering and blending like any other race and people in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who moved back after college to Eatonville to work in the city administration or in the police who could use some help for him.
And even the young people, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only go through here will think, "But this city is nothing compared to all the others," Alondra Kenon said recently on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, you're talking about financial latency.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspapers and violent TV screens in Times Square, they would not even notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe-shaped offices with the glasses, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the Monopol in New York have the worst horror working day ever since 1929.
The suppliers still drive the metal teaspoons along the citizens' stairs and carry tablets that are loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos are still hanging between apartments, as human packers are loaded with the 50 curved T-shirts that hang on a jogg-like strip lying on their shoulders.
Officials are still waiting for food on their breakfast bag, and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 16 and 19 o'clock.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until I decided on Thursday afternoon, because of all the world's downturn, to open a new savings account.
Although I decided to lay my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase family, about 20 people were already snakes.
Not to collect or deposit money on the money switch, but to the customer service switch where customers order checkbooks, tourists on the way to the Macy's shop and where to open new customer accounts.
Most of the time, I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with license", stood for the same reason as I snake.
Unlike me, however, they had already removed their share of smaller banks, in places from which they were hanging, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had removed money from the so-called Trifts (a little similar to a building park), the Societies Banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers as family.
Last year, 15 of these banks have gone silent and silent.
In the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with facilities of $327 billion, in competition management, and as last Friday of New Yorker went home for weekend, was Wachovia, another bank with a savings facility worth $440 billion, looking for a rescue buyer.
In fear of further interference, the office and cargo officers who formed their bar before me brought to a bank that is considered safe port, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on the Wall Street.
Quite normal New Yorkers have adapted to the current financial situation in the last few weeks.
A woman who phoned in my Chinese supermarket took so much confidence with regard to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went to the court and their deposed CEO Dick Full, as if she were reading about a false colleague.
And Lyn, who came from our usual entertainment themes about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery around the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my block.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds" she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any risks anymore."
Muslemic tombs broken during the courtroom in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing director of the Austrian Right Party of Freedom of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Right Pertei Vlaams, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, to represent the organization "Cities against Islamism".
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
The police are accusing law extremists of the kidnapping at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, and on the same weekend, the extremely right party will record significant gains in the country's parliamentary election.
In the night of Friday to this morning, more than 90 miners were seriously injured at the Friedhof in Traun near Linz in an organized action, according to the police.
The offenders sprayed Jewish symbols like David Star on some of the miners, but criminals hold this for an attempt to obscure the motive of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the event is in any way associated with the elections.
One speaker of the local Islamic community said that she was "too much frightened" about the message of the burial, which took place when the religious month of Muslim Ramadan turned to the end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is taking place in Austria after the country's right-wing parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two parties on the far right received almost 30% of the votes, agreed in their struggle for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their election languages were criticised as being foreign.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, took part in a ban on headaches and burkas and even made known his refusal to food, which is generally associated with Islam.
In his last announcement in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minerals with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Investigations and analyses carried out immediately after the election and stating that the extreme rights of the political strongest bloc in the country are indicated by the fact that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel book for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar who was convicted of child sexual abuse, was ordered to travel to France and Spain in court.
Glitter set up a six-month suspension after informing the authorities that informed him of his intention to travel to Spain through France.
The police in Kent were given permission on Thursday to suspend a foreign travel ban after presenting evidence to the judges of Glitter's punishment for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, a real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford Court of Justice in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Cork Binning.
EIN spokesperson of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, police Kent requested permission from Mr. Paul Glad to travel abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not present in person."
According to the register for sexual offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a five-year prison sentence.
The police in Kent said they wouldn't discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible residence in the country.
A spokesman for Kent's police unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the top concern of the police in Kent to protect the people of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual offenders in the country in order to minimize any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter fled to Bangkok, where he planned to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him through the passport and he fled to one and here to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused his entry and fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Finally, on 22 August, he arrived in Heathrow at Terminal 3 and stayed there during his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge's official court in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had previously been arrested in 1999 for 4 months in the United Kingdom because of the possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is calm and satisfied that Glitter was stopped from travelling to France and Spain.
"I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character", Günter brewer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no scissors, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the large flamencotzers who refuse to concentrate and devote themselves to the interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
One-sided artist
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, in these moments that are foreign to the public, I know when I can find typical gestures for the personality, the depth of a stolen glance or expression of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents a variety of theatres on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this page he was not yet known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flame coding at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the month of photography of the Flamenco, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is growing from day to day, explains the artist and makes it clear that 'Flamenco-people' can be any person, but if you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Quite normal people on portraits are artists who are able to communicate passion, sadness, joy and so move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What I was interested in was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to identify the characters of the biggest flamencomers with the camera.'
A farmer, inspired by the festival 'Cante de las Minas', took a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the video sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images created that remind you of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, thereby making the image the modernity and the idea, as the farmer Flamenco understands: `music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
These are not only the dance, the song or the instrumental game, but the personality of the artist, his character, which with his art seduces the audience.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that becomes visible in the form of the ear, of the being, is and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of the El Fotómata.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of almost seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of the Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago and to realize the `portrait of the veterans of sports' ('SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me a lot of pleasure to photograph the people, to know them and to move me in their state of life, whether it's a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult generation.
You meet or resist people, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of the portraits of the Flamencos of today with the title 'Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street with the name la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hercules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says that the Rome he just writes is a great mystery.
He still does not know where the Roman's action is taking place and what it is, but Mario Vargas Llossa is trying hard to move forward the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia Festival, the favorite Nobel Prize winner added that the project he is dealing with is “a great skill” and “all indicates that he did not have to write the novel”.
"If I were to be a man, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel sometime," he concluded his participation at the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La city y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llossa, who won the award at the Hay Festival and who most of the audience gave their voice, is compared to the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and is seen in the theater Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had a audience before him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who had a wonderful memory and great sense of humor, had not been given enough time to go through all of this: how his vocation for literature, which was created from `extraordinary adventures', from `freude on reading' and from `more to experience, from `freude on reading', as it stands out'; how he writes and `disciplining' to complement `the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions made by him; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his profession, and what `theistics it is based on his stories'.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is no way of measuring where and how to know whether books change life, `but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a flying experience', stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it brings out 'effects' and 'humans even more apart', so I asked the writers `not to leave the ease' and `responsibility' for his profession '.
At the party in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: Styrian matches partly fell off.
After the announced combatants found that the ground of the space was in bad condition, the fighting of the bullfight with which the festival was to be concluded in Pozoblanco was to be completed in the morning.
Thus, the organizer, with the agreement of Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to move the star competition.
So the feast of unstoppable weather was exposed, so two out of three celebrations could not be held.
On Saturday it was raining, so the second scheduled match could not be celebrated.
The group of Matadore consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who entered and entered the Styrian struggles.
It was only Friday that there was a celebration.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after whom he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavanante met two horns and a ears of the star, which he had succeeded through galloping than through his art of fighting.
And even worse was El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, most of the audience responded to his second fight with buh-rufen.
In Álava, two people wanted to leave the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilo Haschisch.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Transport checks in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Ålava).
Two policemen called on the driver of the car to stop what they took away.
It seemed that with the loading of more than two thousand kilo Haschisch, they did not have to stop.
The police persecuted her and found one of the drivers, the man of 28 years of age known as A.A.J., as reported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the region of Álava had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
She decided to stop a car to conduct the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to get out of control.
The police began the pursuit until the car stopped after a few kilometers on the border. At the moment the drivers stepped out of the car to fly across a country road into a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally seized one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 Kilo Haschisch, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with Haschischbindels, which were later directed to the precise laboratory analysis and to the balance of the bundle to other police services.
In addition, officials found that the mark was `double', so it did not match the mark indicated in the Kfz papers, and that was why official documents were also seized due to the error of the document.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigations to undertake the arrest of the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to flee, but also to identify the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A. J. was taken to a police station for arrest, and he will be brought to the Court of Justice in the next few hours.
The actor Heather Lockler was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
The actor Heather Lockler, known for the role of Amanda in the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) because of driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
One Witness observed how she tried to escape from her car accident in Montecito in a rather rare way, spokesmen of the California traffic police told the magazine `People'.
The Witness told in detail that Locklear had expressed himself at 16:30 a.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forth from the parking lot, and when she went back, she stuck several times on her sunglasses."
A little later, the witness, who at first had probably not recognized the actor, saw Locklear on a nearby road and stepped out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had `feeling around Locklears'.
When the police arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was standing on the road and blocking traffic.
'They seemed to be pointless', so they brought the police into a special drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to one police speaker, the actor showed himself to be cooperative, excessive alcohol abuse was excluded from the first moment. `The first observations of officials as a result, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,’ the speaker said.
Locklear was suspected of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance that could not be determined, and was brought to a local investigator by 19:00.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released after treatment from a clinic in Arizona, where she was treated with anxiety and depression.
Llamazares states that the Andalusian Association of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and the United Left, today has ensured that the regional education association will be the one who will take the decision in the case of the former Council for Youth and Sport of the Council in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, last week, after he was accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be those who must take responsibility for it', Llamazars pointed out what steps the party must take against the one that so far sits as the City Council in the municipality of Seville.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the violations of the rules that Silva may have begun: 'The VL always insisted that such cases be given maximum transparency'.
In this regard, he stressed that education has a strict ethical code for all public offices.
'Sangre de Mayo': Heldenbuch von Garci
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de Mayo' is the revised version of the famous Spanish rebellion against the French. This is an amazing film in filmography, with about 15 million euros of investment for spinning work.
In this way, the Cinemast has tried to present a lot of personality and social analysis, which he has always admired in the works of the famous Roman writer, Carci explained today in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of the performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday is presented in Kinos and later shown on the Telemadrid sender as a four-hour ministry.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this work, his ‘Kindheitsraum’ went into fulfillment. This has been thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to spin a memorial film for the second century celebration in Madrid on 2 November. Especially because of the history based on ‘Episodios Nationales’, he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the autonomous community of Madrid for rotating works, Garci, as he added, offers the ‘single possibility’ with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing, the image of the ‘confused Spain’ who sought the false leader for the fight because the people were defeated by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand VII.
However, the cinematist regrets that with funding such as 'alatrix' or 'Los phantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as 'Sangre de Mayo'), some scenes from the spinbook with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost all his career, could not be turned.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in `Volver a empezar', was involved in his usual way of working: he stood on the stage with the actors with whom to try first to turn before and for those who had not been casting, he appeared 'degrading' and respect, `part of the work of the film director is there to give help in the theater and in the cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry where you work.'
Many of the performers he runs in 'Sangre de Mayo' must repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranñaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates represented in Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de Mayo', nor 'Siete meas de billar francés' nor the selected film `Los girasols cegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
`At the beginning you believe that you are working for the offspring, later you notice that it is only for the spirits, and now you are satisfied if you have produced a film,’ Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón recalls the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamecancer from Seville honors a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: Her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother, Andalusierin (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert for Oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian, and set herself up for the abolition of the corset, which limited the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her traces of dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role, which was impossible for me.'
'We're not trying to tell you about her life, but to keep her spirit,' said the flamencozer.
Your dance grounds have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
'The dance of the smoldering', for example, came to me like Guajiira, or 'the dance of the snake' like Tango.
Her dance was sensible and I was told that my dances are also in this aesthetic area, she claims.
The stage consists of two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in 'La porta aberita'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
'Food plays Tortola, a very mature person.
I am happy because she agreed to work with me, and I feel very honored.'
The stage also includes musical composition and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he `overtakes the role of the companion of the artists, the Divas, in which he is always in love.'
In this work we also tell a certain way about the life of this woman, who has been known in as far away as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she has normally lived in London.
'I wanted to recall her, because I think she's one of the women who have a huge influence on a particular era and whose works are no longer known and therefore less appreciated,' said Bayón.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 in the theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta reín cadado' also includes the trienium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta reín cadado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez 1916 Zenobia married, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the 'Trienium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is to remember the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the literature Nobel Prize and the day of death of both.
In this way, `the Trienium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress held in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luce', which was opened in May and, after it was in different places in Andalusia, New York is now reached and presented in the course of the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight-hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta reén cadado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
The U.S. can imagine bad without Paul Newman
'Many times God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence comes from the actor Sally Field, who worked with him in the sensational reporter, and from the then dominant performance of the American cinema, which was released in the stick, came from all over America to Newman with his fascinating performance and followed her.
Now, look what it cost her to give him Oscar.
And when he got back in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a great blow for everyone.
'What one feels at times is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a big friend,' said Robert Redford crying, 'my life and my country were the greatest horrors of his life.'
No one was afraid to make fun of or exaggerate.
As the 'father' of the cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment, in fear of terrorists and the collapse of the market, in which the low self-esteem of the U.S. is on the hopeless quest for reasons to retain dignity.
If only a few people who can be admired remain in this hard time without duty, then you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he organized almost a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as a number of losses as well as profits: from the foundation that had written down the fight against drugs and to honor his son from the first marriage, who died at overdose, he was founded to his own brand homemade and organic products.
This is all a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort to cope with a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of wonder moves home over Hollywood without regard to nationality and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died, but all the time.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prizer, said that working with Newman was no more or less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, was waiting to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
'We have left the greatest of us all,' said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who are trying to live faithful today as Paul Newman lived: getting high demands on justice, a responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example.
He got divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, after fifty years, although there certainly were not many possibilities.
‘Why should I eat a burger on the street when I have a home file?’ he often screamed himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily usual in America.
'Of all the great roles he played on none was he as proud as the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and the Philanthropic,' they said.
The streets in Madrid are missing for the Olympics.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the 2012 defeat, it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not right!
She was called the perfect road, and after my assessment, she was the worst road with everything there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you were to observe the evaluation and I could check it, that would clearly not happen.
But from the beginning, let's go through everything.
The nonsense begins with the ticket shop, which allows you to go as first.
I don't think it's bad either, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the crash on the road).
Well, don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first insanity that exists only because of going there) and (after an infinite waiting line) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second insanity because I need the size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper obstacles from less material?
So good, things like these are a little compared to the days on the street.
Except that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting line of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait has lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks lying ahead, even if it had been successful once, but it would be harder to retrieve it.
It also seemed to be waiting for rain in these 40 minutes, so it came to the attempt to organize a national rebellion and to invade the houses.
I think in the morning some 500 people will certainly have lung inflammation and some of the way I'm getting this chip that I've got will not appear in time at the classification, I can already think that the output was misprinted.
Of course, if you would ask me about a perfect road, this road would never affect me.
So I think we'll still dream of a city that's well prepared for the Olympics
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', held by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image identification system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, it is a route planner to move on the company's campus).
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, these "receptionist" can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the key words of their entertainment.
It is also possible to bring the representatives into the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, 'the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that conducts her conversation, and that he is also not a firm employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will be heard soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, one spoke very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many connected programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computer were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling it with the commercial spring, it would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will be just for the few.
Everything is just a finding when you think that Microsoft added some function and `Extras' to Windows versions.
The change in direction is rewarding
Microsoft has the right, the operating system loses its significance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared in the network, it was part of the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
The browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you must think of its 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Balmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention every time to the operating system, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome, and every day we spend more time on surfing than in the 'window' environment.
What is the use of half of the existing applications in the computer?
Less
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
The interest of Microsofts is more about integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In fact, they need it, no doubt, I'll give you a little example of it.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, one of the restrooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refresher network automat is a sign: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a letter to use its own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees in Microsoft, Google, used the network for research.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was late.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, even 2010.
Microsoft is looking to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabulux Marcel
Pablo Picasso held it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Capri had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to wearing a well-built pastor.
If we start to count the countless star performances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a sharp bart that had high weight in a hiking circus.
Basically, it is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, without scarves and trimmed.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank'. Lle Fabulux Marcel de Bruxelles however exceeds all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called in the narrow circle `Marcel'. The legend tells that the name is related to sport and by the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf, stems.
'La Marcel' surprises everyone because of its excellent cotton, because of its different Unisex cut and is distinguished by a small Belgian flag (unrecognizable) that have these T-shirts as a detail on the neck.
And attention, the Belgian company not only focuses on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, Cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, T-shirts with strips, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's very bad to use them as underwear.
They're very beautiful.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is bright, but full of life.
At present, the Grus brothers take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Monica, this means much more than for some beautiful and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of Mango, leaving her residence and also making the presentation of the most important awards in fashion that sponsors the Spanish fashion hall.
Merciful and fearful, winner on short lines.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, and I have also visited the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner with Valentinos.
A very intense working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, as well as I am fascinated by the movies of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I would like to go through a city and observe women dressed as they combine their clothes, which I often do.
Dancer, actor and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but finally, everything happens in one area and these areas have many communities.
Since I was little, I was thrilled with the dress; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to wrap around in my aunt's clothing and see her dress.
That was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to look at the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in teaching and trying to look into the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actor, when you get the costume, you move into the real role of the performer.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and its professionalism.
Recently, you've been 30, haven't you been in a crisis?
But what.
I feel better than ever, I feel better than 30 years old.
I find that the woman becomes mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've been doing since I was a kid, and this has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
I've known for a long time that I'm going to be a mother, because that's what my body wants and I want to be a young mother; I don't want to let it go.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I'm going to convey great happiness to my child and bring it up with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the work you have participated in and the last year turned.
That is exactly what this is and I would like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and impatient and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I would very much like to be listed for the first time 'La final horo' and 'En trazado de la tumba de Cristo'.
See how they like you.
A few days ago, you appeared on the trail with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say anything like that.
It's not like I went on the treadmill to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, has simply called me and invited me to London to share in a parade for the welfare event of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the dress we show. I know that two clothes from our collection for Mango were raised to collect money for Naomi’s NGO.
People don't know Naomi's heart.
I, like the one who knows her, would tell you they don't agree.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing that she is involved in.
She asked me to share in the parade for this great thing, but when she comes and asks me to do a handstand, I will do it too.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
The drivers that can be returned due to the alcohol level will have to install the `alcohol'.
The authorities suggest that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, installs in his car this system, which prevents him from starting the car in drunk condition. If he is alcoholic, then the car does not jump.
The initiative has already been announced in the last month in June and is now part of the report of the Attorney-General. According to them, it is a pilot project that will last a year.
The aim is to resocialize the driver, which is why he is given a course for the conversion of traffic behaviour.
The Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Motor Vehicles will participate in this work, except for the General Public Prosecutor, with experience.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the drivers who were shown more than once because of driving under alcohol influence were taxed again.
The `alcohol' would prevent it because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaust air and prevents autostart when the driver has done an alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is detected which is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are borne by those who impose the penalty.
In this context, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices have already prevented up to 65 % of the regulatory infringements in the first year following its introduction.
In Spain it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to engage in this behaviour before it became a criminal.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a statutory reform can be carried out in the ordinary way, yet a reform of the basic law is required which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
In the morning, the House of Representatives will vote for the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been made in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., at the time provided for by the program, next to the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF, the Spanish aircraft of the air force, the Prince and Prince of Asturias, landed.
The sun went down, but their rays have yet to be forced to use the hand as a sunscreen to see the royal pair that came out of the plane.
Direct at Gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and the princes of Asturias were visiting the city to formalise the official journey.
- Ah, very well, so you can't take people at the airport around this time you're from here or so
No, she's the Spanish, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Oh, that's very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and the Prince of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are many who are waiting in the airport's hangar and on the red carpet, as well as military protection of 27 Marine soldiers, who give up honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the Prince, with long hair worn out by the wind, may have been told that it is expected in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official order is waiting.
At the door of the hotel, where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican television reporter is waiting for her to make jokes.
The best premium for fashion
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly outstanding fashion designers and Bonvivantes than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Boton-Mango Fashion Awards' for the promotion and international promotion of young fashioners.
This is awarded with a cash price of EUR 300,000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, yesterday saw her drawings in the Mango Branch at Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost won due to the emotional excitement.
In addition, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The biggest business is in London.
So many events have happened that you want to thank fashion designer Valentino for his jury presidency at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the environment of many famous people, the board of directors organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the severe heart that was broken by pain, because his brother had recently died, got together. He drew the suit from the fashion hall and caught some beauty from ELAH that was stunning. He stood at the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, greeted the guests and was such a gentleman, so he ended up with the baron of red shield without jackets, because Jacketts lent them to the ladies.
Monica Cruz, she got involved in the business and had a hat and a shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, she showed us a ballet sample room, so she got excited, remembered the old times, took a stick and made a sort of `great pile'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning, we were able to rejoice over the presence of Oliver Martínez, a person who always called out for a stormy enthusiasm, and on Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bed sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, had in advance requested to have a room with no taste.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council against stress
There are not 1000, but one more opportunity to forget chaotic us a daily life.
And even if there are few, they are all collected in a book where there is a way to relax. The book comes into the book deals on September 30th.
The weekend is a punishment when he sounds at 7 o'clock in the morning, but even worse the idea appears to get back into the hectic rhythm that requires the current life.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of turning off from the world of work.
But the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga settings, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the full list of options that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called '1001 opportunities to relax' and thus comes the peace that the book conveys in the book deals of the Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who believes that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual rejects such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If adrenaline in your veins is no longer elevated to restore balance of the body and stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to put yourself on the couch to turn the brain off and concentrate on reading.
Talk to your sleep
Some children talk at night
I mean, not those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case, you'll be scared, but in reality it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called sleep talk.
It is quite common, especially for children and young people.
Surely, more than one of you was told that you had spoken at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), on the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason why this phenomenon is caused.
Often relationships with other phenomena are sought in sleep, such as alpine trees, panic at night, Enuresis noctuura (night beds), words sought in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be very high fiber, stress situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak in quiet words, flirt or it may be quite a opposite (screaming, wine, long discussions ).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and to consult with a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus comes into existence.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is linked to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnoe or with stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple prevention measures:
Don't try to catch the child before bed.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are scary and something too wild.
For the nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
If the conversation occurs once in bed, try to keep calm.
Think that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will be impossible to remember anything that has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you'll get it out of bed.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it calms down.
Considering that after a few appearances, it is recommended to consult or find out what causes the child is afraid.
If they understand what it says (what is not so common), the child is not under pressure to perform a study and get more information.
So you won't be able to do anything, because if the child is asleep, it's unconscious and can't think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming and why it says, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the keys you draw from it.
Maybe it doesn't tell the child that you hear that night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That causes a lot of fear.
So don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Ill-houses ... at last
After a long hard run, Illhausen is finally back on track for success.
Without great effort, the yellow blacks played numerous torso and made it possible to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers were struggling to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose remote shot was close to the corner, Illhausen should easily dominate the game, and it succeeded in changing the first foundation with a remote shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip to challenge the resistance of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only left the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half period should be decisive with two Torchancs first fought by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately with the first door for the Illhauser by Marais, who was right to take again a ball that had been rejected in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the inlet torscot should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, so his team teams had to continue to play a large number of games.
However, Denmark did not know how to use this and did not face major problems of an Illhaeusian Elf, which only drew back a little, to defend them to 'debt', except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball, after a great cross, passed very close to the latte.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another absteer in Brittany.
In view of the decided attitude of the fishermen who blocked the access to several British and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to meet with their representatives at the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he would come with 'concrete suggestions'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a general meeting of the crisis committee established by the Breton fishermen to carry out measures in view of the extreme increase in the price of diesel, which has reached a record of an average value of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Elyséepalast's press spokesman David Martinon, the President will discuss possible solutions with them to help their companies to become competitive again, and to ensure the working conditions and the payment of the seamen.'
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning, they launched a protest march in Morbihan and Calvados, causing a staus of almost ten kilometers long.
The seaport of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break down.
The Quiberon peninsula was delimited with a spree.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning them from early morning on tires and pallets before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic Coast and the Channel, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not export, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique opened the evening of the significant total refinery in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec has to decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the debate planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the national fisheries committee, which has not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue', for 'the fishermen will not be mentioned at any point' and 'do not want to go to Paris', for example, said Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents, but they believe that the cost limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable performer from `Buch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 on the consequences of cancer in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes agreed to the film player Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps his delivery forecasts for 2008
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer counts 215 aircraft delivered, despite the threat of recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, supports its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed by President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the size order from 30 to 120 seats.
So far, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times, the insured American International Group, which has been financially supported by the US Monetary Authority, withdraws more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollars that were allocated to it.
AIG is willing to control the sale of a large part of its business, via its insurance at international level and its age insurance in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG Sunday evening met to check possible sales.
The AIG was unable to obtain confirmation.
The assets of which AIG might be separated include its air leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of the return on the Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its assets and its investments in the private equity, the FT further explains.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG must make the sale as quickly as possible in order to repay the loans over 85 billion that it has authorised the Federal Reserve, even at the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and lose the current shareholders to the same extent.
Analysis Historic Paris meeting Historic morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives had rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks, a historical case of the courses: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of about 800 points, and on Saturday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has reduced by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As far as the points are concerned, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) was recorded earlier on 17 September 2001, the day of the decline in trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final decommissioning figures, the Nasdag index, mainly with regard to technology, reduced by 1.9.61 points to 1.993.73 points, and the widely distributed Index Standard&Poors 500 by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks by the House of Representatives, which should allow for some stability on the markets again, Wall Street, which had already been struck at the beginning of the quarter, broke down.
On the other hand, with 228 votes and 205 abstentions, the Members rejected the funds he had requested from financial Secretary Henry Paulson.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
`Here a bad picture is being put in motion that makes the Congress incapable of adopting a plan,’ said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market was counting on this plan', added it, and fears that a project 'too late' will come in a number of days.
‘If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will be the quick task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, etc. Red.) and other central banks to get the crisis in the grip, which would limit the credit conditions even more,’ warned Brian Bethune, Head of Economics at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, while she highlighted the feeling of extreme urgency even more, `that every day, which distributes, the ruin of a financial company' in the United States, 'with it'.
Following Washington Mutual's competition on Friday, the US authorities planned to purchase Wachovia's banking business through its competing Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated and thus led to emergency measures for banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets ‘not only a US but a global crisis’ were being compared, the analysts added the FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown considerably.
The government's income in the last ten years has fallen from 3,632% to 3,827% on Friday evening, and the revenues from 4,161% to 4,357% within 30 years last night.
Obama, winner of points in the first television set
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday followed another to find out who was the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory for the election of both Republicans and Democrats in this television show, which should be followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCains’ performance, although quite apparent, was not ‘brillant’ enough to allow him to stop his decline in election issues five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, says Obama with five points in front (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that democracy clearly makes the better figure.
With the still unsolved voters, which is where it is now, Obama went out with 39% as the winner of the polls, while according to a CBS inquiry 25% of them viewed McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his preference on Thursday with the good performance expected by his rival Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but warned this weekend, Bill Clinton.
The seventies-year-old McCain did not stop his unquestionable experience in the field of foreign policy in the foreground, and he clearly stressed the 'Naivity' of his opponent on these issues, which were the focus of this first television show.
'Sentor Obama doesn't seem to understand that...' he stressed several times.
'I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to be president,' he also assured.
A point of attack that has been published in the Republican elections since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely without letting himself out of the picture.
He felt his ability to make good decisions and to renew the picture that the world has of the United States.
'McCain has still not understood, Obama has already,' this weekend set a democratic electoral issue against the Republican in which it was proposed not to have recorded the full extent of the crisis on the 'Americans from the street'.
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama rushed to 20,000 people yesterday, who had gathered in a streaming rain due to an election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'middle state' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, who the Americans consider to be the most suitable to save the economy even at the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
'The next week could be a crucial turning point', estimated yesterday by the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared Obama's 'good economic instincts' with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For democratic candidates, the current crisis is the final judgment of an eight-year poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Once again he stressed that he would perhaps even create a reduction in taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, was the top priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates take into account the questions that were raised on the plan for the rescue of the financial market of over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was adopted last night by the Congress and is extremely unpopular with the people.
‘Did you notice that there was a choice in Minsk?’
Youth and opposition protested Sunday evening at the main site of the Belarusian capital in order to deny the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred white Russians gathered on Sunday evening since the closure of the Wahllokale on Minsk market to protest the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against Alexander Lukachenko's power: `The dictator should return'.
Some admit that they haven't even chosen: ‘What does it use if they do it with my voice what they want,’ says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has shown itself to foreign observers in the best way to resume negotiations with the European Union is ready to complete a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the non-participation of Visa for 40 leading Belarusian persons and the withdrawal of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the count', Juri Potemkin, the press speaker of the Union of democratic forces, complained of a heterogeneous combination of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasized by Alexander Milinkiewitsch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and the leaders of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If members of the opposition join Parliament, then because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time, meeting in the regions and legislative proposals.
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering with the political game, because the 'dialogue with the European Union' must be opened.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in a crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we are in danger of becoming a Russian protectorate.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe, which has followed the elections, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that the electoral participation rates appear too high, and that the extension of voting fees in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that a choice has taken place?, the leader of Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released this year in August.
There was no one in the Wahllokalen.
And there will be no more than five members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are the first in line with the government's ideas.
The silence of the night falls again over October.
On television President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
Undermining - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its establishment, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, she has regained the confidence of the public, which had been severely affected by the scandal by the blood that was shed in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood vessels administered by the Red Cross by the Red Cross were contaminated during the 1980s with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever aimed to bring light to the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to draw up directives to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Richter Krever was still reluctant to submit his report, several provinces then set up a committee on the legs, the aim of which was to develop a new system for the management of blood preservatives in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Cancer, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company, to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when hema-Quebec took up his work, almost 38% of the people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and through the work in this area over the following years, we have regained public confidence', she says, before she proudly stresses that in the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, maintains in his consciousness that `Trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting in accordance with the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine disease in Europe with a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since the founding of 1998.
And we didn't have the slightest idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we rely on one of the main guidelines of the reports of cancer and gélineau, which, according to the exclusion measures, is applied if one does not know this and if a disease is only slowly advanced, as is obviously the case with the Creutzfeldt Jacob disease of the case, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was taken from persons who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, no doubt, this disease was proven to be passed on to blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we used has absolutely a meaning.
In 1999, there was a much more accurate technology on the market to detect HIV: the nucleic acid tests (NST) that allow the donor to directly prove the occurrence of the virus itself in the blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case in the previously used tests.
The NSTs allowed to shorten the incubation time that occurs between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be proved by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced for a period of less than one week.
So the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements allowed the risk of transmission of AIDS through a blood transfusion to a considerable extent.
Today, one out of 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, this means that you had to distribute 12 million blood preserves before someone was infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes blood preserves every year between 400,000 and 500,000, it would take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV has occurred.
I think you can feel it today if you get a blood transfusion or write to restore your health," says Hema-Quebec's director.
'Our challenge for the next ten years is to get the security of our products.
You never know which disease agent can get into the system.
Just last year, on the island of Réunion, the Chikungunya virus was discovered, which, like the Westnil virus, will be transmitted by insects over the blood.
We have to monitor immediately', Dr. Décary continues before she stresses that hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies in addition to a safe supply.
'The need is rising, because the people are getting old.
As cancer treatment is more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which on average only 3% of the inhabitants of Quebec suitable for the blood donation. '
Every healthy person, who is 18 years old or older, meets the eligibility criteria, every 56 days, so six times a year, can donate blood.
On average, 14% of the people who provide their blood are not accepted because they are ill with AIDS or malaria, and who is travelling to a country where malaria is spread is excluded for a year from the blood donation.
`With this 3%, we create an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Missing supplies are very rare.
But the members of this donor network need to be renewed if they are older and no longer able to provide blood.
It is hard to convince people to give blood, but above all, to keep them and to bring them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic today that you rarely find the time to spend an hour in the bloodthirsty," laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec not only supplies blood preservatives, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eye drops and skin, which are used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are investigated, processed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public nabelsnurblutbank Quebecs.
In the navel cord, which was previously considered as biomedical waste, there is a lot of blood on stem cells that can be used to treat severe diseases, such as leukaemia.
'We celebrated the deposit of our thousands of Nabelschnurbluttests a few weeks ago, and we plan to take down more than a thousand each year.
"We should probably start next year to make it available for transplants," explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of Nabelnurblut-absorbing as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in the semifinal
Montreal's Impact took place yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all towers) against the Sounders from Seattle at the second and decisive game of the quarter final series at the Saputo Stadium, where the total ratio was counted, qualified for the semi-final round of the separation games of the first league of the USL.
The middle-field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the crucial door in the ninth minute of the game.
After a first half without a door, for both the one and the other, the middle-field players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the Montreals formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the sonders.
We remember that in the first game of the front and back series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila had introduced a 2 to 1 downside in a suburb of Seattle.
In the semifinal, impact will be measured with the white caps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit in the back game in Minnesota through a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps entered the semi-final round with a total ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number 1-Trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Yesterday evening, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostsyn advanced the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fire leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a door, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass into this game, the fourth of the tricolors into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only door of the whole shooting.
'I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel good.'
`He's fixed too much on it in the first half, Guy Carbonneau noticed.
But I think he's lost the end of the game.
He's been hit by a storm.
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister does not decide to hold elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general meeting of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (Linke) is trying to be elected in the current sub-election.
`Move the course of our last large border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the general meeting of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following all the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mountainworks, viewed by Quebec in `Google Maps', land maps, etc.
Large funds such as during the election period.
Against the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would hold the elections this autumn, even if he claimed that his timetable was very full.
The 'Nord Plan' is the fourth element of a 'vision' which the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely the 'new economic space' which provides for an agreement with France on labour forces, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has often been mentioned in the Prime Minister's speech in recent years, the opening of the north - the northern area at the 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North was a `a jewel with enormous potential', but did not call a date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the coming projects.
At least a few views on where more could be done: above all on water, on the forest, but in particular on the mining sector, it favours the growth of the emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to the record, Mr. Charests has the North 'Nickel, Zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This 'area twice as big as France' is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not just near us, it's in us, he stressed how to show clearly that he's looking for a national founding dream.
Quebec is very grown by its connection to the north, he stressed: the road to the gold in Abitibi, the technique Quebec, the James Book.
'It belongs to us, it is our future,' he added after he had entered a theatrical pause to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador, which has always been required by Quebec, the Prime Minister of the press explained.
"This is a traditional attitude that all governments have pursued.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity is offered, I will take this position again on behalf of the government', he said.
Moreover, 'with the climate change, we need to rethink our vision from the north', he explained and spoke about the Northwest Passage, which will be sustainable due to the ice melt all year round.
In view of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is precisely an obligation to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the inhabitants of the villages, and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very concerned about them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (formerly Pecist MPs of Hungary) have already started consultations with some thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, where Julie Boulet (transport and land estimates) took up an important position, took up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, ‘not necessarily a summit’, but an opportunity in which ‘man will create a common vision’.
The development of the North will continue to be replaced in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the North plan will be `declared, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it were a continuation of those of the liberal prime minister who were before him in office.
As the Liberals before us were in the office, we thought about turning the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.
This was, in addition to one of the ever-refused topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party for the 50th anniversary of Jean Readage's acquisition of the party.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the power plant of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
`From Godbout, the Hydro-Quebec created, about reading, which reached the quiet revolution and the state of water electricity, to Burassa, who made the James book, our party always knew how to determine the future,’ said Jean Charest.
The press referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the program 'Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project, Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest, which was scheduled to be launched for 2012.
‘That remains among us, but I have to be there,’ he confided in his party members, which was due to those crashing storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that in 2008, and of course also in 2009, there would be no elections, has in fact not yet been able to hold this autumn an election, which is possible for him by law.
He stressed, however, that his timetable is complete, especially because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The general meeting of the weekend provided the liberal party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially 'the constitutional objectives', which were adopted without further adoption: the PLQ specifically calls for recognition of 'the speciality of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It would also like Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Television Council and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were included with Skeps.
The leader of the Québec Party, Pauline Marois, reiterated the policy for the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Government introduced in 2001.
According to the Liberal Government, when it came to power in 2003, it refused to apply it.
If she had done so, ‘we are still much more today’, Ms. Marois, on the side of her candidate in Jean-Tallon (where the election is taking place today), said Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its support for the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that this is not just going to be a big idea," explained the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who comes back from the holiday today.
Letters - A country of refuge
Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (which irony) in the cabinet Harper, it was the last summer that allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'change' for Canada.
This woman, who has led an unending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do this with a government that, as the only one in all the countries concerned, has not taken their countryman captive in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even consider Omar Khadr as a youth when things happened that were being proposed to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and allows a child soldier to hunt under inhuman conditions.
The only one who goes down to a judicial parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers' Association advise that Omar Khadr go home to get him a fair trial in Canada.
This government also closes its eyes to torture: It is of little interest that a young adult after so many years of quail will certainly be broken forever.
We are not aware of it yet, but we are just experiencing a domestic violation of our rights, our freedom and our `democracy', this word that harper wears in front of himself constantly, and that does not sound so distasteful from his mouth.
Thus, the time has come when there is no more morals: a Canadian citizen may deliberately abuse, torture and torture, even after the well-being of a government leader, who is only supported by the minority (may belong to the minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government has given up on what has been called the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this dissatisfaction, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellish Speech of Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-general of the Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an orwelling logic that the world's largest gold-making company sought to open a six million complaint against three authors and a small, medium-sized publishing house with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of slanderous complaints, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely suspended by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to drive everyone in the ruins, who is waiting to represent one of their opposing opinions.
Just as the process requires, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare for their defense and fight with very uneven weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid out of the almost inexplicable pockets of goldmines.
The tactics of these unequal struggles are, on the other hand, often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consistent regime that makes the opposite side go wrong and also scares anyone who is waiting to take up the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things before the public opinion.
Unlike what is going on and on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold is working, debates in Canada are usually carried out by exchange of ideas and not by buttoning.
So it would have been enough if the goldmines had published their books and records and opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent testing teams that could have brought light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have confidence in the public opinion and erases the petitions and letters to support Noir Canada's authors with a hand movement.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could at the same time ask for a 'public' debate, but did he deny the opinions of this public?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President's world includes only the extraordinarily paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very well-closed view of the concept.
In a democracy, even the derogators have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this primarily because it rejects the brutal attitude of gold mines.
This public is willing to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many as a knebel lie (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just addressed a request to the authors of Noir Canada, in which it requires them to no longer use this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and the truth that is fundamental to every democratic society.
It is absolutely right to quote credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that do not fall for the rich companies of this world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long known to get debate and disagreements in the grip and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate complaint clearly shows that, contrary to what she is proposing, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that restrict this type of unfair complaint.
Rescue for the Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
The Bush administration and the leading congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike came to an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan of over 700 billion US dollars, which is intended to stop the financial crisis, which has been killing Wall Street for months, still needs to be adopted by the two Congress Chambers.
The main content is: a better control of the Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the used public funds, new arrangements to mitigate the number of houses due to payment delays, as well as the right to monitor the fees paid to the leading employees of the supported companies.
The US Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective," explained the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
'It all happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the crisis at the Wall Street,' the Democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: If we don't do this, the trauma, the chaos and the unrest in the daily lives of Americans will be huge," declared Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, in fear of the effect that would have had a renewed decline in the mood of investors.
The deadline agreed was that market opening this morning.
The two US presidential candidates who were involved in the negotiations only later showed themselves to be supporters of the agreement, but without neglecting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barack Obama was on the addendum of certain provisions to agree, especially those which should enable the owners to keep their houses and those which are the holders of the heads of employees of the state-owned companies.
‘If the taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures due to the incompatibility of certain persons, that is nothing to which one might wish to be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary', he explained on American television stations.
When he was asked on another sender whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I would like to know the details, but I hope so.
"The clues I have read show that this is a thing that we all have to digest and with which we can move forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable', he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at the money of taxpayers
He comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the location of a real estate blast that first led to the collapse of the risk-rich mortgage credits (subprime) before spreading to other forms of wider bonds (PCAA) and finally in a freeze of financial power and in the collapse of banks and money institutions.
A group of Republican MPs, it was the first attempt to break the agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain `toxic' assets of the companies in need are only secured by the government and not to be purchased, one believes that the gas is out of the way.
In order to round the perspective for everyone at the congress, one has also added an opportunity to say that, if the government should lose this programme within five years, it could raise new taxes in order to retain the capital used by it.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to be able to reach another 100 billion if the President sees it as necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be adopted in a renewed vote by the Congress.
In contrast to his help, Washington receives shares from the supported companies that bring him in the case of dividends, and that can sell it again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to maintain the settlement procedures for the housing loans covered by this plan, and also to set deadlines for the repayment and the inventions paid to the managers of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the House of Representatives to vote on it today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all her efforts, she is still not sure that her plan will get green light.
In fact, yesterday's vote against this project, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats, was taken.
'That Washington obviously doesn't understand us,' declared Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Board's Financial Commission, his electors.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who exist to ask the taxpayers to pay for the case.'
The democratic deputy Brad Sherman, leader of a group in the Congress called the "Caucus of the Skeptics", represents the things different, but comes to the same conclusion.
`Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written us to tell us: we ask the Congress not to be under pressure, and carefully consider which way to be put in," he explained yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we have again received evidence that this is a global crisis.
At a emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial publication of the Fortis Banking Group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The accession of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French Bank of BNP Paribas announced that it would refuse to buy its competitors, which are in serious difficulties, since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis by the high-risk capital credits in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty-largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, explained yesterday by Dutch Finance Minister Wauter Bos.
To compensate, we receive a right of choice and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announced.'
During this time, the British government was on the other side of the army channel just to find another bank under threat from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government has to settle since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the blue eyes was long his trumpet, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor get rid of the charming smile of the Nazi mirror?
Yes and no.
His feelings, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what for a great runner!
On Friday, at the age of 83, Paul Newman died of lung cancer in Connecticut, one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, for which he was like and for which he had been a kind of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his performance, certainly even more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the excitement of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as a son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-speaking mother.
Its European roots should be one of the strange faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality.
Because in him a whole country, which was in love with the self-made man, was again reflected in the fighter who was injured in the war in the Pacific, who studied art in Yale at the beginning of the 50s and then visited the actor's studio in New York, before he had success in the theater, television and soon also in the cinema.
Even this man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became Man's second 24-hour race in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he had lived in a pre-relationship with the actor Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, withholding, engaged, and with respect to the glamour of the show business disappear, whose puzzle will never be completely solved.
An upright man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans moved the movie lovers this weekend to Tamil, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American film art is constantly changing with it.
Then the charming Cowboy from "Buch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) came back to the memory, and the young man, whose sensible wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Die Catze, was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter recollection (1990) will be called to mind, which is at the heart of his sensitive Mr Bridge, who will be disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all of his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans were in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role that was thought of for James Dean, after his death, and made the Newman correctly known in 1956.
This beautiful Ganove in the amazing The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a charming and rich billard player in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, it was him.
He's still here.
In his course of life epochs unite.
The young man knew him, especially from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in The Hudsucker Proxy of Brother Coen in 1994.
With a last role in 2003 as the path of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
In contrast to several filmmakers who had moved away early enough from the film world, Newman had to stay in the satellite for a long time, and in this case, Hollywood, his assets, his punk and his concessions were betrayed.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'underplaying' when he assessed his very expressive performance.
The Metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles had been so fleeting for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, fieslings or doubters, with whose perfect representation he reflected his dissipation and dissipation.
As director, Newman revealed unknown pages of his true fine sensitivity.
His Rachel, from 1968 (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the lead, drew a fine female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by an overdose, dedicated this 1984 his film to Harry and Son, a work full of emotion and sadness.
In the flood of lands that were yesterday about Newman ergoss, his close friend and former gunfight Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said extremely: `His present has improved my life and this country.'
Proudness and joy of life were essential qualities of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, he is now also a major defender of citizens' rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood demobilization, there.
We have often seen it with the foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, bakeries or other foods, and this has been quite tasteless, even though at first we found it funny.
However, the profits from its turnover flow into its foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myths, Newman engaged to the shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Always and until the end of the day your father was incredibly grateful for his good stars.
It was an honor to be here.'
And for us it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
A provocative citizen, in the narrowest and widest sense.
What was produced in the account factory of Auslag &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, negotiations in the criminal process began against János's strike and his complications.
In particular, the defendants are accused of engaging in organised crime, as well as serious serious damage and fraud, as well as other criminal acts, including document fraud.
According to the Public Prosecutor, the funds covered by the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often presented with false calculations.
Government funds and grants from self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be part of the funds of the organization Fiatal Balldal, part of the private funds of each individual.
As stated by the investigating authorities, fictitious calculations were submitted in relation to the tendering money, and the associations should also not comply with their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the calculations were to be false.
The billing blocks were purchased on the market of Józsefváros, the round seal was placed in Kisunalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was decided on that round trip north of the Plattensee, to which István Lados by János was awarded a grant.
In the course of this "exploration tour", Lados should find out about pensions and restaurants.
He asked for bills on consumption to be able to present later calculations based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest.
These calculations should have been manipulated mostly by István Lados and his complex, András 中ri, which should later have been responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "Expert Tour" was a beer room.
As two of the additions and Co's accounts issued in 2003 are to be taken into account, the gastronomy company will have secured the 9th-century group of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
But now the head of the company says that such a large group would not have been able to fit into the site at once.
Another account, published in the summer of 2002, at the Job Jöv ért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also revealed serious forms and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are expected to stay.
The fantasy of the accountants were obviously not set limits as it was about the Pigal Kft. went, a gastronomy operation, in whose bookkeeping documents of customers Job Jöv ért and Hoppá according to the prosecution authority did not even appear.
As Managing Director Gy†zˈ Farkas of hvg.hu told him, he immediately realized that it was false documents when it was submitted to him by the Public Prosecutor during a questioning.
"Our company name and the tax numbers were wrong on the stamp."
And further: Apart from the error of form, the fact was also wrong that the company should have accommodated hundreds of people after having a total of eleven rooms that offer as many people as possible space.
Also, the restaurant has been in operation for a long time.
The Emsian Accountants have also failed to verify that the Budapest Travel Office, which they took in visas, offers exclusively travel abroad, and thus they have indicated Hungarian travels on the cash account, which is also contrary to the company's accounting practice.
As was known in the course of the investigations, they have also pointed to the calculation of value added tax, although travel services related to a country outside the EU are free of value added tax.
The amount of VAT was totaled to four invoices issued at the Job Jöv ért Foundation, as the company was charged 25 only 15 percent VAT, and only machine invoices were issued by the employees, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another error that was encountered by the "accounters" was that they had indicated in one case "goodstransport" as a performance provided, although this is not offered by the company specialising in investment advice, the public prosecutor informed them.
Further error of form - false accounting format, false stamp - was to thank that the calculations of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as the twenty-first. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont were evaluated as false.
Also in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports warehouse Kunfehértó, whose managers had condemned never to have issued the invoices.
Another "false" is the faker at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was at the time (2001) just in a resolution when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület were supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore stated that the calculations did not have to be issued on its own.
Consciously False
The other group of accountants are persons who were fully aware that they had to lay fictitious calculations.
At the request of the Fiatal Balldal - Ifjú Socialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapest Alapitvány has issued invoices for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadi Évezredért, at an amount of HUF 4 million.
According to the prosecution, the manager of the Colllab Kft. was transferred from one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to the exhibition of fictional calculations.
The biogate Kft, currently in liquidation, should also have collaborated with grants and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH will have provided the Job Jöv×ért Alapitvány Foundation, as well as the Egyesület and Vörösfeny have provided Egyesület with false invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million that are not provided.
However, there was also little payment traffic, as the accounts were destroyed immediately after their exhibition, but what the interested parties had forgotten in their documents.
The third group of accounting officers shall comprise persons directly brought into contact with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian Managing Director of Delta Trió Kft., a company located in Budapest, but there is no fuel and vehicle trading company.
This company is expected to issue several invoices from October to December 2005 on the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF approximately 18 million.
According to the investigating authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kisunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, has been the buyer of these calculations.
The company's manager was a Romanian who should also be provided with company documents by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov stood up during the investigations, invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the Associations Atlas and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány and to have canceled their own counter-value.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-investment Bt. are to be founded by Romanian walls on Iván Kubatov's express desire.
However, in truth, none of these companies were active, which, according to the defendant, was in the absence of orders.
However, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his complicity, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was commissioned to prepare the company's founding submissions, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations linked with the grant, such as Atlasz and Y-Generácí.
In total, Kubatov will have exposed 15 bills in the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The Public Prosecutor's Office assumes that Kubatov could have cancelled 10% of its accounts and VAT.
Kubatov is supposed to have even misused Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictional calculations - in this case the calculations were added to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generácio and Sövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihaly Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but these amounts were used out of line.
To avoid this, they presented to the TMA five fictitious calculations of the Works Team Kft.
These calculations were also secured during the search of the Office of Arpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, a number of defendants are now counting on the way in which they have been dealt with before the Public Prosecutor.
A sensation could be if the main defendant, János, decided to make a comprehensive statement.
His earlier details were less detailed, and although he had already promised to report in full about everything, his conscience still stands out.
The question remains whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the restoration of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether a grant is ready to take responsibility.
But it is quite possible that the supplement now plays the "comfort" after his attempts to soften the arrest and house arrest were thrown into deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have suffered far greater damage with economic delicacy and have not paid them, are on a free foot or at least under house arrest, this option remains rejected.
The psychology of the area - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to issue more and thus overestimate the error offering.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic basis of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" Magazine, people in a competition, such as an increase in eBay, are not beaten and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "games" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while the others participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the sample were investigated through functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games the participants were able to earn money, however, an increased activity of the street, a complex below the brain, was measured at the loss of the auction, where the cross-section of the opponent plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore felt that the increase in prices could be explained by avoiding an over-reaction of the contract.
In order to undermine their thesis, the economists in the research group have also used research to track the money.
In this case, three groups against a partner should be provided under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product and then made their interventions.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward, in the event that they are coming out of the game as winners.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was simply that the emphasis was on one on winning, while on the other on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the "losing" group were willing to raise their positions above those of the "wine" group.
"These results can not be derived from any previous economic theory.
These are the behaviours observed in auctions so far only with the joy of winning, or risk prevention.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to the resulting neurological procedures, so we have now prepared a third explanation" - said Andrew Scotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor to be contacted?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected is estimated to be hundreds of thousands in this country, however, only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the total term for liver disease caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common; however, the symptoms differ from one another and the diseases.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two different species: in hepatitis A and E through the digestion tract (e.g. by contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, skeletal secretion or mirror).
Travellers are recommended for vaccination against viruses A and B, and there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are approximately two to three weeks after contamination of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and fractures.
Then the jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine is dark, and the healing can last up to two or three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die of hepatitis B-dissolved diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis each year.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only every 10 infected are in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have severe consequences: it may lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancers untreated.
Most infected people do not even know about their illness, since the errant has accidentally destroyed the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms are shown after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely precautions such as regular checks are essential.
There are three groups where this disease is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already evidenced in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the home doctor in the first signs of unknown origin.
In due course, the disease is healthy, the virus can be eradicated, thus preventing the risk of infection and predisposing cancer.
The World Day of Hepatitis is held on September 30th, 2004 for the first time in patient representations worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of these chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early recognition.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research shows, religious belief as a kind of "sickness" has already been shown, which should have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It has been investigated how much faith in God affects the pain of the human being, the British newspaper "Telegraph" reported.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, every 12 believers and atheists received electroshocks, while they studied a painting of the mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to disable most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project, in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participated.
When the samplers were tried, a working device was attached to the left hand which gave the electroshocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: To one image of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to the other Leonardo da Vinci "Damme with Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary among the believers would bring out a kind of religious trance, while they chose a picture of Vince, because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt as soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and at this time received a total of 20 electroshocks in four stages, while they were either to view the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they had felt at the sight of God's mother "in safety" as if they were "uncareable" and had felt "peace and peace".
While considering the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the experiment, thought that similar effects could also arise with other, highly effective images even in the atheists, only to find the corresponding photo.
"We should find a picture that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and it does so in many cases," says Wright.
After these excellent results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality young woman Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you're telling me about you.
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can claim with fug and right: it is in people's pockets as well as on their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their holiday, which doctors they go to, and what they are moving.
And that's still not enough, says Eric Schmidt, one of Google's CEOs.
In the direction of Skeptics, which are ordered by Orwell's Horror Visions, he can point out: They would just ignore the essentials of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times Schmidt recently meant that the main goal of Google was to collect even more personal data about users and thus to get closer to the original goal of the company, where they want to "order all the information in this world".
Schmidt explained that after ten years of global change in work, Google was still at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked for the status Quo in five years Schmidt meant: he wished Google would be able to do questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job really suits me?", however, software programs are not yet able to do so, as they did not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches, search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search and then to take back to it, so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and also based on the same logic the so-called "recommendations", with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services due to previous preferences.
However, users are wondering what happens in the case of a data error - "If you look at what I'm doing" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that has a devastating effect on fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the desire for power, which is opposed by many internet users.
However, it is a fact that not only the search terms are stored but also passed on to third parties on the occasion, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example of this was the short-term action against paedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which the Brazilian government's Google provided information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also made it possible to identify the paedophilia.
However, in May, users who were concerned with personal rights were still able to breathe when Google successfully brought EFF against the FBI, together with the civil rights organization: therefore, Google can not be forced to issue information to the FBI on a confidential request in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully implemented the issue of 50,000 Web addresses and 1,000 search terms, with reference to the youth protection legislation adopted years ago, but it has been able to maintain the list of individual users, namely their web and search terms for two months.)
Google's image thus remains controversial: Those who release their personal data are less likely to fear the loss of their privacy and privacy by using Google services, and the company is making a contribution to the conservative companies.
Indes sees the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and entertains computer fans, activists and users, the next generation of the "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leaders, even though both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not require identification codes for its users, and its services provide free of charge, so that an open, continuously updated source code and program package seems to be much more attractive, young and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the Geeks are looking at the problem of personal rights and the Internet, a relationship that has been addressed in particular over the past years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
In "Web 2.0", there is nothing else but collaboration, talking, leaving users deliberately tracking and using the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are different individually, the main thing remains the same, that is to say, public.
At the same time, an average young person can manage his profile on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, they can connect them through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can finally include all of this in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that automatically present the latest photo galleries that are hosted by Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove: In considering the party photos last night, the friend will soon find out who she has enjoyed with her unfaithful friend, or the employee will be released, because in his blog he only makes quite honest his worry about the company's leadership - one is sure: the term "private" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Anyone who leads an online life is what he prizes - in such a way as to formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even run the Google monopoly, can do it well - like with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine, but will not leave any traces.
Not few people deliberately register not on community pages so that they are not found, but also Google's online applications, such as text processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can deal with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and therefore not generate the best possible profile from the user.
The public opinion waits for Google to show her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even in front of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenues of the advertising agencies, and the services that are increasingly quickly introduced provide not only Microsoft, but also other software developers break heads.
However, critical observers also find the disturbing contradictions: For example, the group leader rejected a protest of the employees after the fees of the firm's children's garden were doubled, in addition the management of the multiple staff's care was too expensive. However, it is quite mild that in 2006 Google even went to the knees before the Chinese government and agreed with an agreement, which would filter out all of the regime's critical hits, or those who violated against the good taste.
The Group's internal regulation states that, in advance, no new service will be purchased, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could be significantly reversed: While some believe that Google's book and magazine scan or archiving project will now take into account the extent that the company should soon be in contact with the Supreme Court, others are concerned about the "Health" system, which enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already delivers the material - e.g. "Scroogjed", the famous Roman of Cory Doctorow describes a future in the best orwelling manner in which a person is appreciably attracted by Google-related data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd in the elimination of the trace
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interviewed two young people who are suspected of having helped with the destruction of the trails, the spokesperson of the Police Commissioner Borsod shared on Tuesday.
The young people were steadfast, they are currently being accused of aid.
According to the MTI News Agency, it is two girls who defend themselves on a free foot.
Aid is threatened with a penalty of freedom of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into investigation on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having murdered several people from money.
In the course of the investigations, it has been shown that the 23-year-old owed a 53-year-old a larger amount of money.
However, the suspect did not want to compensate for his debts, so he put his believer on a plot in Ozd last Wednesday, where he and his nine - year - old daughter murdered him.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act long - this also proves the fact that he has committed the murder with a gun hidden on the roof.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapons and the circumstances of their use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the 100% purchase of the shares package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by Poland despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, but more than 60% of the paper will be sold in the coming months.
Following reports from the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the Polish offers include the highest purchase price offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far offered.
Peter Koblic, Chief of the Prague Stock Exchange last week said that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owners, and he did not conclude that it could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange on 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In her comments on the ongoing international financial crisis, on Tuesday, some leading European leaves have already spoken since the "second 11 September".
We have to thank the US President for the global financial disaster, for example La Repubblica - the President has not even been able to bring his own party to the draft legislation behind one that should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion-dollar investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be appropriate to speak of a "second 11 September".
Parts of the press in Madrid also placed the sin box in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of the collapse.
The U.S. financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the congress vote, it threatens the danger that Washington has no political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy depends in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, such as the genre "Days Indicators".
However, some countries could provide their money institutions with rescue packages and save banks with the money of taxpayers from the bank's debt.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there are no more banks to deal with, then neither further financial incentives nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States had to jump over their shadows and centralise control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid to weaker money institutions, the Viennaer "The Standard" reminds us. Furthermore, so the newspaper continues, the concerns are increasingly realistic that, according to Americans, European taxpayers now have to get a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously tackled the crisis, which is now like a tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "restors" should not immediately "weld" with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to consider in which case it would be reasonable to seize the money of taxpayers to avoid even greater damage.
Smart car simulates the flight of the sky
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to prevent accidents unless you imitate nature's barrier sensors?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, a wonderful project was presented, in which the Nissan engineers of Hummeln were inspired by the creation of new preventative systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic system controlled by autobots of type BR23C, a mini-auto, equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In the flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective shield", Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology-PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The combined eye of the bees, which can see in any direction and in an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to reflect the function of the composite eye, the researchers take up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles to the BR23C in a 180-degree face field within 2 metres, calculates its distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to board, which immediately initiates the collision prevention process.
The barrier is recorded in seconds break parts, and the autobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this manoeuvre is purely instinctive.
"If it weren't so, the autobot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the Autobot project.
The system needs to react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most astonishing part of the shield - a layer, which is still unavoidable within the accident.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of bees if they avoid other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, the deviation, unlike the bees, can not go up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, but only in the direction of the turnability of the tires.
While the bees here are endlessly open to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use only the movement of the autobot, or the acceleration and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are easier and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on data processing, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device must process only some inputs per second and respond accordingly.
It does not have to save these, or by using earlier manoeuvres to produce an intuitive, logical reaction, so it is constantly only a handful KB Memory in demand.
There's no need for gigabytes and megabytes-hard memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which will be serially in production within the next ten years, after Nissan's assessment.
Another application could find the technology at GPS satellite navigation by raising the driver’s awareness of obstacles and thus leading him to the goal.
A name for the sinner child
Now there is the written version of the 700-dollar heavy rescue package law, which will be applied in several stages and aims at the purchase of bad loans from banks.
In the first passage, half of the money is to be spent.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight, on the east coast, the congressional delegates, following a multi-day debate, reached an agreement on the 700 billion-dollar heavy rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, a democratic president in the U.S. House of Representatives, and thought that agreement should only be brought to paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said the result: the program will show effect and it will be effective, but more is needed. According to Pelosi, it was not about the rescue of the Wall Street, but about the noise of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, so Washington's time Sunday, 8 a.m. (Middle European time Monday, 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high-level flight to the stock exchange.
On Monday, the House of Representatives agreed first on the draft legislation on the stabilization of the economy of 2008, and then the Senate is on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and also the White House welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
However, the program deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush administration, whereby the 700 billion dollars should be issued once for the purchase of fakes, with debt-loaded securities.
In a first instalment, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after the Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This sum is to be set aside for the purchase of credit institutions, poor securities, and over the next 100 billion USD is to be decided by the President.
The programme shall be reviewed by a Commission itself, which shall also be chaired by the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combination of tactics: it can at the same time buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-based securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As reported by the Ministry, the purchase can be carried out both in an auction and directly.
The law enables the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the funds in question and the companies pay the costs to be expected to be incurred.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to 700 billion dollars can be provided as immediate aid to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of poor funds, their insurance, or the prevention of a systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger monetary institution.
We take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, so Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks in difficulty and now targeted at state aid can expect to be cut off by the government by their manufacturings, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang.
A reduction in the fees will be made only in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry buys in an auction, the "Golden Handshake" will be paid unless the bank manager who is spent on the pension is retired.
In the case of a direct purchase of the fake credit, the government will be aggressively engaged to ensure that the managers are not overrun.
The picture also shows that the existing Gold Handshake contracts are not amended - the restrictions relate only to new agreements, so that more people can participate in the program.
This is the first case in the American history that cuts in managers are regulated by law, the Democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, commented on the measure.
The State gains participation rights in participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers is reduced, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the bank is better off.
The draft legislation stipulates that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years on how taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were on both sides skeptics who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect the taxpayer's money at all, so the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures were preceded by the same people who are also responsible for the collapses of the Wall Street.

No more visas in the United States since 2009?
King Göncz sees good chances that the US-Hungarian Visa Agreement will enter into force on 12 January, as the Foreign Minister explained before the representatives of the Hungarian municipality in Chicago.
In your view, "it is only now to be expected that the electronic immigration control system will be introduced in a timely manner in overseas."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists had to register in advance.
The Head of the Hungarian Diplomacy is conducting negotiations in Washington from today's day.
She meets with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will deliver her "Middlerere vendigre mit Stern" of the Republic of Hungary, and also conducts talks with the foreign political advisors of the Democratic Barack Obama and the Republican candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue packages for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates from the major American parties, pledged their support on Sunday for the 700 billion-dollar heavy bailout package for banks, but there are also politicians who call for the withdrawal of the Minister of Finance.
The government Congress and representatives announced on Sunday that they had reached an agreement on the Bank's rescue package after a long period of advice.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the emergence of the frozen credit market, have been the main issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claimed to be better suited than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After a recent survey, Obama was able to further expand thanks to the economic themes, while McCains Hoch, who protected him from the presentation of Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was still suffocating.
At an election event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would quickly adopt the law on the 700 billion-dollar heavy package.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passports of consumer protection that he has supported with.
"We need to act now, and yet responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, all industry, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened" - he said before 35,000 spectators.
He didn't hesitate to call McCain's economic vision "absolute".
In an interview given to the ABC sender, McCain said: "We will all have a hard time figuring out (...) but there is certainly no alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan also provides for the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of the manufactures for the top manager - something he had been on.
The CBS said Obama, McCain would not have played a final role in the negotiations, but Obama, who was in contact with the Minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill on Monday.
German-language press release
The right warehouse is intact, only the voters became self-conscious within the warehouse - "The Mirror" comments the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (speckle.de)
In the online issue of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayer's Revolution betrays its fathers".
According to the renowned politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein Huber-Duo took over his office.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bayern for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
At the same time, the epoch break is a problem of Christ democracy as well as for Angela Merkel.
Not surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not end on Sunday, but something happened, which was already quite ten years ago: the unmistakable hegemony of a state party
Because 10 years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and thus fell for the first time since the 1950s under the 50th percent mark.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 federal elections, which is still in the much quoted Stober era.
The modernization carried out by the CSU in the Federal Land has ultimately distributed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at the time it was estimated to be significant. However, without impact, the secularization, the success of education, the upheaval of East and North Germans in the prosperous Bavarian regions could not remain faithful to the CSU voters.
Modernization is always a matter of increasing options, and this has political consequences.
The right warehouse is intact - only the voters within the warehouse became more critical and self-willed.
It is noteworthy that in the last few weeks, the classic citizens' groups have just expressed the greatest distance to CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with abitur as a college graduate.
The CSU's support dropped to almost 40 percent.
The Presse (depresse.com)
The conservative Wiener daily newspaper reports in her "Who with whom? Participatives holding back on coalition issues" entitled articles about the chaotic internal political situation in Austria after the new elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with the OEPP.
The OEF prohibits the involvement of the SPÖ in internal matters.
The BZÖ shows itself open in all directions for talks, while the Greens do not yet want to decide on a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is moving around the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the parties rarely looked at their maps.
SPÖ-Chief Werner Faymann confirmed his wish to negotiate with the OVP.
SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very much possible - in some states and in the social partnership - this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the OVP as vice-cancer, was raised by Faymann.
As he said, the voters had chosen the Süssel-Motterer course.
A repetition of this direction is not in question.
Molter has responded carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful if Faymann tried to intervene in the internal affairs of the OVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or going into coalition, is currently fully open, and these issues should be discussed internally.
BZÖ-Chief Jörg Haider showed himself in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take on government responsibility," said Haider.
Járóka: The devil circle of poverty and the segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit in Paris has begun to bring about equality, which is being set up today by the EU Presidency of the Council of France.
In its speech addressed to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Commissioner of the European People's Party, drew attention, in particular to the education organisation, as it is one of the most serious violations of the law that the Roma children avoid, and this was the greatest obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The participants included representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European law enforcement and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office of the Fidesz spoke, Járóka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, Rome would be forced primarily because of its low level of education from the labour market.
"The vast majority of Roma youth have no secondary education, and due to poor primary education, only a small part of them can reach a university degree."
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right, which is a key role in the exercise of other human rights.
Investments in early training of Roma children could boost the economy of the EU Member States.
In the opinion of the honourable Members, it is important that this relationship be made as broad as possible - Rome and non-Roma - as possible.
Because the earlier a Roma student starts school, the stronger his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market, and through income and income taxes, they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, Rome must be guaranteed the right to quality education - the poor and segregated teaching must be set up" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Members have explained, a common, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to accelerate the deregulation process in the education sector, and it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be properly adhered to.
"We must break through the devil's circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as full-fledged citizens," Járóka asked.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit will be held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also at national levels, within the meaning of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the electoral debacle, there are no heads, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the personal debates were lost.
Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein are still in their offices, the question is how long this grace is worth.
On the fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent loss of voice will be decided at the extraordinary party on the last October.
However, the many trained duo had already shown that it did not want to stick on their chairs.
In this way they want to address the angry group and the party base, which one day after the "Bayerian Tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority of the personal consequences.
Five years ago - given under the leadership of the Edmund Stoiber at his career height - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. However, now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4% of the votes were secured.
The CSU was a 46-year-old "Alleinregierer" in Bavaria, which produces 18 percent of the German GDP.
The Conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern state of the Hungarian economy as well, but they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party's internal restructuring, the potential successor Huber, Vice-President and Federal Minister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the research team, which will lead the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "free voter" polling on a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate is that with the list of "Free Voters", Gabriel Pauli enters the Legislator, whose anti-stolen appearances the Huber-Beckstein Duo first took advantage of, in order to preserve the aimless politician.
The CSU leadership now concentrates all its forces on the stabilisation of Becksteins.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who has so far taken the threads from the background, will become an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU President, on 28 September, called the "Better Day of His Political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic remarks towards CDU - in his view the CSU would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thereby also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has contributed a great deal to its success at the national level in 2005, is not put back on its legs with a joint force, Merkel cannot be a chancellor again after the German elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who, from her disappointment over the Fiasco, did not make a cure, believes that the land loss of the CSU would not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the confused CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bayer since 1946.
Lukaschenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no opposition MP in the Ukrainian Parliament was created.
Russian observers believe that this is the state of prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD is suspected of legislative contradictions in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
The legislative act of the 10 million inhabitants has come out without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, the opposition party, which has been gathered before the controversial elections under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS), has seriously hoped that Lukaschenko, who, in the course of the unholy elections and a constitutional change in 2006, had already renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time, would "let some members of the opposition in Parliament" this time.
That's why the ODS even distanced from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more dependent on the rising prices of oil imports from Russia, and even credit has been taken up to offset price increases, and the country has also accepted the sale of the Beltrans gas, the owner of the country's leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. Thus, in the light of the opposition's expectations, Ukraine was to improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukaschenko and other high-ranking politicians have banned entry as an anti-democratic political system in the EU.
For temporary relaxation, the OECD election evaluation report, which focuses on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD rapid report criticised the campaign already on Monday - therefore opposition should not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present when counting the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition has been able to recognise an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been placed on a free footing, and Minsk is even more willing to confront Moscow by continuing to reject the recognition of the independence of the detractive Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine is a federal state on paper, has been considered independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our blog.
According to the 2006 presidential election candidate, a continuation is desirable, although "the mighty fear has been given to leave only one opposition to Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but rather seeks to clarify the need for an economic reform to the voters.
"We have many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way of selling stones, but I still see that more and more people support the change, even the older ones," Milinkewitsch said in a statement that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agree with the Lukaschenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the debt of the country and the rise of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" that begins to break into the silence of a cemetery," said Milinkewitsch.
In contrast to opposition politicians, Russian observers have referred to the elections as democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, stated the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the facts, not the words." The absence of the opposition was therefore a proof of the rabies of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
From now on, the measures will enter into force against those slave owners who will only stamp out and then go for coffee drinks during the working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
">"Treatable doors are a means to increase labour efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," says Brunetta again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says this: "The choice of the rotatable doors is also of great symbolic value".
On the part of the officials there was no resistance, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides".
So all in all, there is now no breakfast during the working time; close with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas talks about this with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the High Committee of the Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Administration)
from Rome, the Minister announces that "within three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, which means 60,000 people per year are more present at work".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy
"your wage dynamics - so the Minister - have been twice as large in the last 8-10 years as the private sector and far above the inflation rate."
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined in opposing the Brunetta decree under the call supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service profiles with numbers of lower absences at work - as the consumer centre writes - the people of the 'active faulpelze' grow uninterrupted.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have come together to declare war against the law."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related diseases; the planned extension of the compulsory residence of the sick worker will also be called into question, during which checks can be made and further aspects of the Minister's innovations.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day, 2500 work accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 people remain alive.
For the year 2007, the data of Inail (Instituto nationale contro inforuni sul labora) confirm that the fatal accidents at about 1200 were at work.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon, which almost doubles the number of deaths caused by murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will be on the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work in order to draw the attention of the social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The data provided by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nationale mutilati et invalidi del trabajo) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of jobs, the protection of injured workers, assistance for the families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"A "Basta" has risen to this; of course, in tragedies that, measured at their size, trigger some revolutions in the media and public participation. But the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is also a resource problem at all: there must be a decisive investment in education and information."
The numerous initiatives to raise awareness in school frameworks are of particular importance to young people in the workplace.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to derogate from its social seriousness. A legislative standard must be put into effect and improved.
On the other hand, the President of the House, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of death is an urgent social emergency that affects the conscience of all of us and forces all of us to work on certain rules that have the aim of putting an end to the problem".
"The data of accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not mean that the number of deaths at work is too high," says President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive trend" to mean less attention. That's exactly what ultimately causes tragedy."
"How do you think you're actually doing too little to deal with the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight on the other hand through various actions.
Stronger controls and inspections are necessary in our opinion – so on Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to clarify the workers who are already starting at school."
"An additional effort is necessary - he adds - as regards communication and public awareness.
But above all, there is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers to a phenomenon that is a social emergency."
Mercandelli also referred to "the progressive deterioration of the protection of victims of accidents at work" and called for "the abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the worker a guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the victim of a job accident does not depend on voluntary or random donations, which will be decided by a legislator from time to time."
Mp3 player in charge: danger of hearing damage
Listening to music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 player, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which, in a report published today in Brussels, cites the opinion of Csseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU.
"From the report – that is to say in a note – it will be clear that 5-10% of those who hear music with portable instruments for at least five years longer than an hour a day are at risk of permanent loss of their hearing."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who usually place portable music devices and phones on a high volume, their ears without knowing how to irreparably harm it," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings – as it has been called since the eu – there is a clear risk that is too quick to act.
What really matters is to sensitize the consumer and to make this information common.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
"The scientists - so the EU's communication concludes - confirm that there is too much concern and that the Eu Commission will now examine the necessary measures together with the other EU members and those concerned in order to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable musical devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard that limits the level of sound of portable music devices to 100 dB. Concern about the damage that could result from excessive noise.
These damage can be very limited in which solutions such as the reduction of volume and the length of noise exposure can be achieved.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the Eu points out that if users of portable music devices hear music only five hours a week (more than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits are already exceeded which apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who cross this border risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
So this is 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the Eu.
Rome, Germany gives the start-up committee to the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We're starting today, it's gonna be over in March, in June, we're gonna get a balance sheet.
This is the outcome set out by the Chapter for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the capital of Rome". The Commission has met today in the new seat behind the Caracalla terms in the morning.
In six months President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the city and municipality council will evaluate the analyses and projects to be able to imagine the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the capital and the mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," says Germano. "They will make proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility remains the city and community council.
There is no new distribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will be relaunched, as such a project must have a certain end point.
In June - so announced by the mayor - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the Commission's work".
Those who question the competence of the Commission, as their opinion fails to be bound by it, are all dependent on the work which the Commission will do and the quality of its proposals.
If, like in France, she delivers quality results – and this will certainly be in Rome – then her contribution will be fundamental.
The policy often deals with the daily problems and emergencies that arise from time to time.
On the other hand, we want a longer period in view to work seriously with a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city".
The mayor of Rome places great value on stating, "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a fraud: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizen a cent and it will bring us to think about it. It will occupy the best heads of the capital."
According to Germanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetically nor static to allow our city a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step towards the future".
A future, the mayor of Rome, which "will not only restrict itself to the present municipal borders but will continue to look much further", not only with regard to the role of Rome as the metropolis and the political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here's a statement
A well-known American politician, who is much about being considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will become the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who dismembered the U.S. economy by his decisions and maintained relations with the occupied Islam (and still does this as a private man)".
The attacks against Obama are getting stronger, right now, where the elections are approaching.
A woman from Miami wrote on an Internet site: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very cool: he thinks he will be given the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!".
However, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the polls; all say that Obama will win with a great advantage.
In this case, too, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in her editorial: only in the election room will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
Here is a mentality of the United States that has been kept hidden until recently.
"Say what you want, then we'll decide for whom we'll make our hooks, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people in there who swear: if Obama wins, we'll get out of America.
Something you never heard before – just now, where the success of the black candidate seems so secure.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistake has Bush made during his term of office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a kick in the back.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
The financial collapse leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and mental control of the future.
Today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they explained that the information concerning the competent authorities is not really concerned about the general credibility.
They don't feel as alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed for these journalists.
In addition, the major problems arising from the cuts in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work, in order to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from being seriously shaken.
A clearer but complicated pessimism is now fulfilling the American journalist.
Six of the ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, the executives are even 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in which direction the web is going.
The main publishing groups are on their way to the Internet, which is viewed by many as the "killer" of the press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, in the hope "they bring some good for journalism".
The biggest rice is in American journalism today between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of heads of directors at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level they are only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "security in work".
The managers who are afraid to lose their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
Of the journalists, there are 30%.
The theme of "safer work" in the team (our "editors", note d. Red.) is always a current theme in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, such as the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV broadcasters and Internet operators, employers offer as they like and so it will be a question of taking it or leaving it.
The editors receive very often very high wages, but at the same time the editor can only receive 10000 euros per month, including pension and insurance payments.
As far as vacation is concerned, the matter is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third year, to finally reach a certain number of 15 days of vacation.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, are often "sick" during the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: GERICHT IM ROM: DANILO COPPOLA LIMITT IN GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Chamber of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinauda, decided to reject the application of the real estate agent, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola because of the bank red in the context of the counter-agreement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be transferred from the province city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the Court of Justice, he could be given the opportunity to influence his company and to obtain evidence against him.
The Elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already been revealed some days ago when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the 700 billion-dollar savings package of the White House: one large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than the economy.
This confirms the bold release of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in the course of the process is increasingly fragmented by the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and modern East Coast soul, which has always favoured the state institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives that are hostile to "these in Washington" and the financial world and, for example, win the southern and central elections.
This part of the party thanks its rise to the vote I mentioned above.
This just mentioned example is, in fact, only a small part of the major changes that announces the current economic earthquake or even represents: not only in the US, but also in the whole West, and perhaps beyond these will be affected.
Both in the countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-feared events that are finally adopted and brought to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the re-discovery, the unheard of renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions that have close links to the rest of the world and at the same time manage an immense amount of the assets of private households living in a single country.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: how to deal with the families concerned, which is also a huge electoral mass.
The crisis therefore appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have gone away and lost its right of speech: the clear evidence for this has been given by the EU, which, due to its distribution in various national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common way.
Therefore, all of us now rely on the intervention of our own country; rescue plans, new rules, and, for example, distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the United States is in the economic position to save itself without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: therefore, two non-overestimating conditions – under certain circumstances – which may not otherwise be possible for an international organisation or for a similar market.
The new emphasis on the state-national element is, in addition, perfectly consistent with the growing importance that is brought to the attention of the economy with a more closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxer's way is right now, when we were so convinced of it, to be in a networked totality for the longest time, in a wealth of ever differentiated technologies, the intangible that we have to discover at once, how our future will increasingly depend on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although these can be transported from one place to the other of the world, they are still connected to a closely defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the person who has such a territory is in favour of another living in a land free of crops, waterless or oil-free.
I now come to the second novelty, but it is a brief introduction.
Who is the territory, who is the government, who says politics, so also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for leadership, so the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of equipment on existing routes, such as those of the economy, which have emerged as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper richer and in some sense even more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an indictability, an image of insatiability, a sense of distance that is all directed at a whole class of managers in the Western countries.
It seems to me that the belief among most of the population is that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but it is already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority as ever more distant and more overwhelming.
The demand for leadership is therefore undermining a slow but powerful movement of the demise of the leading class and of the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in the unprecedented "revolutes" of the voters and in the unmistakable transformation of the collective status of the last time: beginning with the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, to the rebellion of the US MPs against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the rights in Italy plays a role here).
The impression is gained when the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, magazines, intellectuals, some would say their format, increasingly understanding problems and therefore less representative value for what is happening today in the lower social layers of the West and is still strengthened by the financial crisis and driven to over-dimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be excessive to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping the eyes open is certainly not.
The super key to use to top of the walls
The forces of gravity, thanks to a adhesive, can beat and climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four U.S. research centres, one of which seems to be almost target.
With a sticker mounted on a surface of only 2.5 qcm, the researchers managed to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – with an American magazine, published the results of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material discovered by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which uses a special carbon structure called carbon nanopipes.
"The principle of the glue can be represented as a series of spaghetti-ordered pipes," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hardnesss that give the animal a perfect stop.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the resistance of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "allows to remove troublelessly from the wall", says Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
AN MAUERN ENLANGWANDERS? "This material could be used as a portable adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
For example, how to get Spiderman into walls? Perhaps already, but the researchers think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also leaders of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall in the area of space transport.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF FORCHUNG – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the California scientists present a adhesive from microfibres that clean themselves like hair by moving on a surface of dust itself and thus maintain a perfect liability.
Medicinal products: never take fruit juice
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitamin-richness in the summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken with certain vital drugs at the same time as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of them by the body.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeats the risk of both packaged and fresh fruit products in connection with drug intake. During the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again sounded an alarm: There is enough a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs so that they are practically eliminated and the health of the patients is threatened.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medications such as antibiotics, antiasthematics, heart circuit medications, anxiolytic and neurological resources, up to toxic levels.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.
ES IS NOT GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that may inhibit medicines.
The list of substances covered by the fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal by Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, who are so free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to always read the package leaflet and, if there are any uncertainties, to have no shame asking a pharmacist or a doctor," the experts of the Ansa Agency stressed.
Paul Krugman’s Economics Prize
The economic Nobel Prize is for the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of the Enron crash, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the Attents.
A prediction that has not been received by a few polemics as a response and that the economy has been held years later, but today it is quite true.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public view," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economy of great value", but also a banalizer with a "very aggressive style that is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, the third version of the Anti-Microsoft package appears
The day of the publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 came; the Open Source software wins as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among free people and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developer, who is being monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself with some news to the public: in addition to a revised and now more sparsely designed start-up menu, it is now finally one of the reasons for ensuring compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x operating system, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, which is the latest standard ISO version.
Eight against the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier to send via email. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files in graphic editing module and at the same time to preserve the original page appearance image.
Thus, "hybride" PDF files can now be generated, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited multiple times by different users, thereby avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor will be asked to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just about to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the cloud on the Internet, while in the coming weeks the final result should be made public.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. It follows the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
Besides Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
In order to encourage the distribution of the program in private homes, it is also in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed in the big project: in the end, various public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, it is not even missing from a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus opens business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the word corresponding to the text production program; Calc, the table program aimed at a compression of Excel; Impress, for the creation of presentations like with Powerpoint; Dbase for the operation of databases instead of the more familiar access; and last draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily over 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
Also the coal tested positive and thus the fourth doping fall
A new doping fall opens to me as part of the last tour of France: it is the Austrian sportsman Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is the third-class player and winner of the best climber's trick.
The message published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on her website.
The 26-year-old coal from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, tested positively on Cera, the Epo of the third generation. Previously, this was already the case with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The blood samples of coals included those carried out in the last few weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
Confirming the counter-tests now the positive results on Cera, the Austrians will lose their third position and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordy confirmed the positive Epotest, and reportedly also the Austrian officials, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrians went behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans on the podium and also claimed the tricot of the best climber for themselves.
INSTRUCTIONS: THE NEW YORK TIMES: IS ITALIAN RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the single country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only being taken up with opposition.
Does this make Belpaese a nation of racists? This is asked by the New York Times in a long article dedicated to the whole issue of racism in Italy and comes out of the case of young Abdul William Guibre, based on Burkina Faso, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after he had stolen a pack of biscuits.
The case is evident from what the Times refers to as "the Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and work opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrant feelings and the greatest support of the North Lega".
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation, introduced by the lega, against immigration and the speedy introduction of illegal immigrants, is also indicated as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also underlines the Pope and the President of the State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal to cooperate between the Church and the State in combating racism."
Student victims of high rental prices up to 900 euro per room
The market for apartments for students does not know any crises.
According to the last study of Sunia, the rental company, a single room can cost up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken very difficult moves. A lot of students lose their right to study so effectively as their families are not able to support them at this level" – so the Sunia, Laura Mariani – "in these cities the great demand from the students leads to a deformation of the market that has damaged the other residents as well.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, without price limits, unauthorized leases.
For Sunia, there is the need for exceptional measures that lead to a revision of taxation to lower rental prices.
For more detailed consideration of the investigation, it appears that in Milan a sleeping area is needed in the quarter of Brianza about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the quarter of the band Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the quarter of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or at least 900 euros in the quarter of Vittoria.
In Florence a sleeping area costs an average of 350/400 Euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the districts around the university, 250/280 Euros are for a sleeping area of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices around the Union are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double bedroom.
Just a little deeper are the rentals in the districts around the other universities of Rome: 550 Euros in Ostienne and Cinecittà.
Only one can save money in the outdoor district: 300 euros for a sleeping area and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 Euros for a sleeping area, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 Euros in the most expensive districts, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping area of 250-350 Euros, a single room of at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where renting to non-European students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rental that is 25-30% above average is required by foreign students.
In return for the old Kino Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
Historical cinemas are closed because of the blessed multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening in the major urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of demarcation of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multisaal complex in the periphery, means long-term death for the singlesaalkino in the center. A process that not only appears indispensable and irrevocable but also carries the trains of a cultural crime.
Most of the historical places of memories are affected, "it's like losing a friend with whom a piece of road has been left full of emotions," said the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oscar and the great price of Cannes 20 years ago. It's about the history of a pre-city cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a probably forever lost movie.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade union, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the unhindered quantities of 316 traditional cinemas have to be closed; these Zech paid most of the cinemas in large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main debtors are the multiplexkinos, because there are just these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, the Lombardy is running the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also occur, but first of all, the preservation of the existing one, because it closes a hall in the city, not all of his family customers are ready to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here, there remains the missing state for the commercial association fund, with the debt burden recorded by the State of about 10 million euros.
It is a violation of the ethical-moral position that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be needed in the year".
It is interesting to note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which has decided to protect it through an agreement between the community and the Anec. It is the first agreement of this kind in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The measures provided for also include tax advantages for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in relation to proximity: it will be allowed to drive in the traffic restricted areas of the centre and also to park for more favourable parking charges.
"It is a happy initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also develop new concepts.
But of course we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to focus on the superpower of the multiplexs, because the audience is now more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important subject for me: the closing of the "supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the striking point that led me to establish the "Nuovo cinema Paradise" even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; if I go through the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so that I do not have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia group Piromelli.
The accusations of the prosecution of the Antimafia Authority of Calabrians against mayor Giorgio Dal Torreone and his representative Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for the development of mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromelli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew, was also taken into custody: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced to a sum of EUR 10 million in compensation for the Mafia crime.
"Any kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromelli money for advisory activities."
"So it was made possible for the Mafia Group – so the judges – to take official steps to the Councilhouses and to agree with the public administration's policy."
The President of the Committee of the Regions, Agazio Loiro, does not deny that in his region it is "all other than an exception to encounter links between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others, in which such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta': heroes who get a white West."
The arrests of this morning follow those of the last July, with which the police of Clan Piromelli were rescued.
Since the end of the last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro has been dissolved, but in 1991 – and also at that time due to close ties between organised crime and local administration – local politicians of their community have been removed.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of Udc, was elected to the head of the Central Committee after the election in May 2006.
He screamed as the prefecture arranged the resolution of the municipality.
He was interested in the Deputy Minister Marco Minniti, who was determined to have invented everything for political and strategic reasons. However, the judges explained in connection with the arrest warrant this morning that the Piromelli-Clan had even been waiting to apply for a change in the A3 project.
From a hearing in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torreone case, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group about the Piromelli, has been shown to be the same as the interests of the public administration."
If the energy emerges from the waves, all of a sudden the sizes run on.
It is a non-favourable source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and only now seems to understand the world's large energy companies.
Waves, currents and currents are the new renewable energy sources that everyone now looks at, and also seek to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years, and these studies have not been significantly intensified since the first earthquake.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of marine energy was lost, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the oceans.
This is equal to double the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and times are still coming.
Giants in the attack.
The first company now putting on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract to establish a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy sector that focus on marine energy gains.
"Chevron is investigating these technologies" – the speaker of a company known as the U.S. giant in the Wall Street Journal – and is alerting us to cooperate."
This is about obtaining authorisation from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project ahead of the coast of Alaska.
This is a non-estimating sign, e.g. if you consider that oil is still being promoted by the United States in Alaska and President Bush just put the plans for new drilling in progress.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new sector; the details are also unknown, but observers speak of an increasing interest.
Even more valuable technologies.
Experts speak of a technology that is still emerging, which is not the last, as the last doubts of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy to a large extent, technologies with far greater environmental impact are needed.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interrelated boots.
The foam of the waves, which move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer over flasks and cylinders.
This one drives a turbine, which then drives a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast through underwater pipelines.
So far, there are four planned facilities of this kind, which are only waiting for the state's approval, and some of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power is already producing energy for a shopping house and a parking lot using sea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the seasons are driving the turbines that feed the generator through the rotating movement.
According to Verdant, a long chain of potential customers is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
Only the waves, then the seasons.
According to the Institute for Electricity Recovery, a special interest is currently worth the potential that lies in the times.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the times are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also the waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
In particular, modern energy is what states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million have already been planned for 2009.
