Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
The International Group of Biologists has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrates are Greenland’s polar shark, which may live for some 500 years, transmits RT.
Scientists have conducted a radiocarbon analysis of 28 Greenlandic sharks.
The largest shark with a length of more than five metres may be 272 to 512 years.
Biologists believe that the long-term role of the shark is a low metabolism that leads to slow development.
Women of Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity for only 150 years.
Previously, it was thought that the "neighbor" of the shark is a Greenland whale that lives long enough for all belligerent animals.
The oldest person known as the scientist was over 210 years old.

Is it worth going to a sanatorium if there's no health problem?
Our expert is the chief doctor of the sanatorium of Olga Bogus.
And if a healthy person just gets tired of work, does he have to go to a sanatorium?
Sanatorium-curricular rest is needed not only for treatment, but also for disease prevention.
In a sanatorium, a person can check the condition of his or her body and receive advice from a doctor on how to live so that his or her health will not be damaged.
No one will be left with such recommendations.
"Just stopped working" is an important signal of the body, it is not worth avoiding.
Constant stress, mental and physical depression can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And the stress is about 90% coming.
He has the highest number of people in large cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's better not to make it difficult and allow yourself to rest in time.
Studies show that 98 per cent of the population are lowering their biological age during the time they were in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable rest for the entire family.
So if you want to take a vacation with your children, you don't have to break up with them.
For children, even the smallest, there are health programmes that include both diagnostic services, paediatric consultation, analysis and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums have children's pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, curative physics.
The course of procedures shall determine a doctor taking into account the individual evidence and characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, in sanatoriums, a children's club is usually working with animators, where children can attend play lessons, different master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with young people, provide the necessary conditions and provide the services of an experienced ninja.
Mild winters, long summers, sunny days per year (over 300), create good conditions for a round-year rest in the Caucasian Mineral Water Courts.
And then the body needs to rest not just for the summer.
So there is no fear of window weather, as most procedures are in place and do not depend on the season.
In general, health care is desirable twice a year, especially for adults.
The main fish of the Caucasian Mineral Water region, of course, is the treatment of mineral sources: Slavyanski, Smyrnovski, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and affects different systems of the body.
The water varies by temperature, number of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects water depending on the patient's feelings.
So, Narzan has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory action, restores the functions of the iron and oxygen tract and the exchange of substances.
Essentuki-4 affects the iron and oxygen tract, reduces the sugar level.
"New Essentuki" has anti-inflammatory, yellowish and wet action.
The same effects include Slavian water.
When appointing water, the doctor must take into account the state of the heart-consistency system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it selects less salty water, because the salt holds the fluid to increase the pressure.
The acceptance of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drinking at a certain time, at the required quantity and at a specific temperature.
There are now various cosmetic procedures available for individuals and bodies in the sanatorium.
What types of healings based on the natural characteristics of the North Caucasus can be found in the resorts of the region?
Near Petigorska, for example, there is the salty Lake of Tambukan, adding a piece of which is useful for the systems, the bells, the internal organs.
It provides anti-inflammatory, dissipating, immunomodulatory action.
It's a healing walk on individual paths.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort (second in size in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is close to the mineral source Narzan.
The baths can also be taken with wine, creamy, iodine-resistant, rural, halves and lacquered, depending on what your doctor will appoint you.
Long-term fertility.
What do you do to harvest the sheave by the end of the season?
He tells Julia Belopuchov, an agronomist, and a duke.
The high-level atoms are time to set up a string: to clean new belts, to cut the mascots, to remove all leaves from the previous brush with fruits and flowers with small bonds - they will not be able to build.
All tomatoes, regardless of the “constitution”, as well as peach and beaked with super-saturated gold, are processed by bioparticles (the suspect, for the acceleration of the flow and growth of fruits, phytosporin-M, phytolavin, Gamair, Bactofit, Immunoscitofit, for the improvement of immunity, Bitoxybacillus, Lepidocid, and Fitoverm, if there are harmful).
Of the chemicals at the end of the summer, only the copper copper, the cold cheese and the green melon should be used.
We're doing the last crop of plants.
We put the long-plated rags in the heat with the shovels so that the lower, covered part of the rod (25-40 cm) is on the ground, we pour hot water and Circone solution, we pour 5-7 cm of compost.
It is also difficult to extend the bud’s fertility: cut the old leaves, pour the hot water and solution of the complex well, pour down the fertile soil under the bush.
In order to protect from nighttime colds, lay over a chain of hideous material.
Keep the day of the plant open, and close the sun when the sun sets.
It's the end of the line.
What indicates that Russia is coming out of the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia's departure as long as the last twenty years of recession.
According to Bloomberg's analysts, RFP's GDP has shown positive dynamics, with GDP declines by 0.8 per cent in the second quarter of the year.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data, the Russian economy fell in the second quarter to 0.6 per cent.
The stabilization of the situation has also recently been described by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Development.
It's a slow growth.
According to the CBI experts, the recession in the Russian economy remained in the past.
"Indices of the Russian GDP estimate say that the recession is behind and ahead is a slow economic growth," says the Russian Bank 'What trends are talking about.
The module assessment of GDP in the current quarter of the controller has increased to 0.4 per cent, and the assessment for the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
As the representative of the Ministry of Development reported, the fall in GDP in the second quarter of the year was 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleansed GDP drop was 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline was stopped: in April it was 0.2 per cent, and in May and June, the change in GDP was within 0-0.15", quoted the representative of MER RIA as saying "Novita".
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the last five quarters indicates that “the bottom”.
Among other markers that show signs of national economic recovery, Bloomberg calls for increased demand for electricity and rail transport, business revitalization.
If an amendment is made to the fact that the year is high, it is clear that the dynamics in plus 1% of electricity consumption can be partly due to an additional working day.
Add a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight transport, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data here, and plus 0.5 per cent of the half-year volume can also be explained by seasonality," explains Kiril Jacobenko from ALOR BROKER.
On the other hand, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lowering the price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
Moreover, the last two weeks of Rosstat fixed the deflation.
The prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the roubles, which, even though it showed strong fluctuations in the beginning of the year, has increased by 12 per cent since the beginning of August.
This is also one of the signs of recovery for which real-economy indicators must be drawn," says Jacobenko.
In addition, there has been an increase in industrial production since April.
In June, the rate rose by 1.7 per cent.
The rate of decline in external trade from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May is slowed.
Positive dynamics also demonstrate the situation in the labour market, where unemployment has decreased to 5.4%.
The following was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the issue of real income will be left to the public to the best of their ability.
In the annual expression, the rate is reduced by 4.8 per cent.
This may slow the recovery of the economy, as household costs make a small contribution to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the economy is more than 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia's strong policy can also be called a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator maintains a rate of 10.5 per cent, which is not best affected by the real sector.
A negative factor is and is not sufficiently high in investment, which hampers industrial capacity development.
Overall, however, it can be assumed that by the end of the year, the fall rate of the RF economy will be up to -0.5 per cent compared to -3.7 per cent in 2015," said GK Analyst Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of athletes recently launched in Russian football and experienced in winter sports in Olympiad, Sochi, until they are so active in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and the former foreigners are, in most cases, the natives of the former republics of the Soviet Union.
Therefore, in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process - a large enough number of Russians are under the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of the change of nationality varies.
Someone's parents have been taken to another country as a child without leaving a choice.
Someone has failed to compete for a place in the Russian assembly.
And someone thought that there would be better conditions for development in sport outside the border.
Aif.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian nationality.
A 27-year-old girl's German passport says her name is Lisa Rijs.
But she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omske.
Four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union broke down, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to go down the steps of her older sister to take up an easy sport.
Just like her sister, Lisa chose the six-bedrooms.
Stay with her in Russia, I think she'd hardly be able to move from the throne to Elena Isinbaev.
Unfortunately, the Olympics in Rio Liz will be the only land we have in the six-bedroom sector.
Its best achievements in this kind of sport are the 2010 bronze championship of Europe and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which it won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaev.
The 29-year-old Elena Pirozkova was born in Novokusneck in 1986.
Her parents are religious evangelists.
Because of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight more children were raised in the family.
They all lived in a small town in Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started fighting at school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where the U.S. Training Centre continued to be under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izboijnik.
At the 2012 Olympics, Elena lost her first grasp in London.
That's why it's the same year for the World Championship.
Before that, she was able to win the 2010 World Cup silver.
After that, there were bronzes in 2013 and silver in 2014.
The 26-year-old Mary was born in Jaroslavle, where she first met with synchronizing.
But it says that it would be wrong for our coaches in Russia to raise her.
Soon the girls ’ family decided to emigrate to the United States and move to Colorado.
There Maria continued her activities.
Soon she had joined the United States Assembly and had shown great results in the Pan-American Games.
It is understandable that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America, their indicators are a threshold.
The new name, which sounds more strange in Russian, was received by Kristina Chaldibina at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue teaching a girl in the arts gymnastics after the ocean.
Up until now, the girl has been a favorite sport in the Jaroslav family.
By emigrating to the United States, she quickly entered the youth assembly in that country, and later also broke into the main national team.
In Pan-American games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
The first position on the world stage, of course, did not come out, but for the United States, it organized the current breakthrough, which led to a star-fighting assembly at the Rio Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another one of our ex-students is Jan Berezko-Marggrander, who serves for the German assembly.
She was born in the Toledo.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more opportunities to attend the national assembly.
She soon represented her country in the 2012 Olympics in London.
There, it is true, Jana was able to take only 17 places that were not enough to engage in the final competitions in the personal premier.
So two years earlier, she was able to win the bronze medal for the Olympic Youth Games.
Another gymnast, only this time sport is Irina Sazonova.
If the migration routes mentioned above can be called standard, the choice of the Irish family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is an educator at the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she was the champion of the country.
True, Ira is trained in Russia, but she comes to the family in particular so as not to lose her skills.
She's not as successful as she would like to be in Rio.
The best place is 40 in a private multi-story.
The information about the picturesque Maria Uglko in the Russian information area is very limited.
For a very long time, Maria lives and is trained in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, she had spoken under the Russian flag, showing poor results - even the country's record was 200 metres away.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and became a member of the red-white flag.
In Rio, its best speech is 14th place in an integrated stage 4x100.
In order to win the game, the girl launched a Crowdfanding project that enabled her to collect some 6,000 francs that allowed her to pay for the Olympics.
A 31-year-old free-style fighter Adam Batirov spent almost all his career under the Russian flag.
At that time, Hasavourta's grandson was able to become a three-time champion of the European Championships, a Russian champion, an international sports master of Russia.
When he stopped falling into our national assembly, it was time to think about a change of nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from the sports grounds.
The triumphal return took place at the Asia Championship in 2016 - Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and took a trip to the Olympics in Rio.
For another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinova, the family knows less than even the Swiss plethora Maria Ugolkov.
His parents emigrated from the Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was quite small.
That's where Michael started sports gymnastics.
He had not achieved much success at the international level.
In Rio, his best score was 40 seats on parallel bridges.
But for New Zealand, even falling into the Olympics in sports gymnastics is already broken.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family migrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her practice in synchronizing, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, a girl in Berlin took 6th place in the synchronous navigation at the European Championship.
In duet with Eugenia Tetelbaum Anastasia took eighth place.
She was the fifth in the salt program.
As with Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Croyer is in favour of the Israeli assembly.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitri was the champion of the country.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Croiter won the gold of the youth Olympics in Singapore.
In addition to the high beds, Dmitry has long and triple beds.
31-year-old Albert is another Hasavourta native who has decided to change her sports nationality after long speeches to Russia.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert has chosen Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he attended the Krasnoyarska High School of Sports, even becoming the country's champion in 2011.
The 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the joint SSSR volleyball game Yaroslav Antonov.
Almost a year before the birth of the son of Jaroslav, he was recognized as the best volleyballist of the world.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family remained there for a long time.
In 2015, he became the bronze champion of the European Championship in the territory of his new family.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and fell along with his family in the war’s most difficult situation.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
Norway was a real goal, but it was not possible for it to become a country in the north - it had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn to fight freely.
He soon won the championship of peace among the youth and later qualified to participate in the Olympics.
In Rio he will be the only representative of France in the fighting tournament.
It's a free fight again, and it's a former Russian again.
This time it will be about the birth of the Northern Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain, about Timor-Leste.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and he is currently serving as a team of the country.
To date, the 30-year-old sportsman has also been successful in Russia.
He became the bronze champion of the country ' s 2007 and 2008 championships.
The Charter of Independence in the Assembly, Timeuras decided to change sports nationality.
The last on our list is a Czech boxer, born in 1995 in Dagestan Machačela, Arthur Biyarslanov.
When a boy was ten years old, his parents took his family to Azerbaijan in Canada.
There Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began boxing.
Since then, Arthur has been the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he has become a champion of peace among young people.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the Pan-American Games, the first for his new family since 1975.

Why do children have class speakers in schools?
According to Governor B. Condratiev, the word “needs to be raised, not by actions and councils, but by system. ”
They must grow and at least seven years of age understand that they must be a speaker.
But as long as I think this work is done formally, I suspect, more on paper.
If the speakers of the class take all the positive things they've collected before, at a quality new level, I'll be happy.
If you're all drunk and you don't know how, the new idea is going to turn into cheap populism.
The CCC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
The funds allocated to the common area from the budgets of various levels are allocated.
According to the Office of the Prosecutor, the higher rates are one of the most common crimes in the field of CCC.
As a result, the region's consumers have paid more than 170 million rubles to energy users.
In the days and offices of the Krasnodar province, the facts of the inclusion in the unwarranted charges have been identified.
At the expense of the IW-consalting (cold water) OO, 4 million rubs were placed on the rental of cars at higher market prices.
And such examples on the side of the mass.
The people pay for the "communal" last money, and they pay correctly, according to the RF Ministry, the average population payability is 94 per cent.
It is immediately accused of several articles of the Penal Code: corruption, the legalization of proceeds obtained by criminal means, abuse of powers, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the city facility repair fund, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, and the work on them was not actually done, but paid.
Businessmen just gave him a lot of money back.
And as the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay the service providers and spent them on their needs.
As a result, millions of rubles are damaged in the budget and in the housing sector.
Macarov's makeup scheme is typical of Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and detentions by the leaders of the U.K. who had committed to the money of the citizens.
In Kamchatka, the trial continues over A. Kohan, as well as a former forest MP charged with fraud of 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013, he established 6 management companies in Elizovo Kamchatsky and established 3 limited-liability companies.
One of them was working for the UK, two others played the role of the cash centres, i.e. they took money to the population.
However, A. Kohan did not count the money, but spent it on himself, dear.
It's quite difficult to deal with in the field of CKH.
Things don't get excited, they're slowing down.
And "helps" in this extremely complicated housing legislation, Svetlana Ravorotneva, the executive director of the NWC Control.
We do not have the ability to earn one law, as we expect a new one to make the previous one work.
Specialists, including judges, are also limited.
The lawyers themselves recognize that the right to housing in the knots is very low.
Refusals in criminal proceedings are also discussed by the Office of the Attorney General in the course of investigations.
Less than half of the crimes committed in 2015 are committed.
For the remainder of the investigation, it was prolonged, and each fifth was suspended due to the non-establishment of the accused.
The shortcomings of law enforcement bodies are often recorded on gaps in existing legislation.
There is a law, but there is no rush to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 sub-debt reports - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
In the five months of the current year, their number has increased only slightly - 99.
What is the falsification of the housing protocol?
This means that the change in household management, financial and other issues are affecting the opinion of the owners.
And that means that the housing and municipal services market cannot be run by normal companies who want to work honestly, not "give" the population.
There's a lot of housing in the mines, a small and medium-sized business, too.
First of all, through the eradication of corruption as such throughout the State, Anton Zarkov, a member of the Committee on Property.
And now this work is going on.
It's not just a single action, it's a targeted course to fight corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, there are scandals in the capital and they don't smell.
Why is there no such scandals in Moscow in the area of GKH, as in many other regions?
Since the capital Government had exercised iron will and had arranged, the "Aif" had told Anatoly Election, a member of the Committee of the Gossmads on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean both staff and legislative amendments and legal education.
The management companies have been closely monitored, and all of them have been licensed.
Citizens ' complaints are quickly resolved in public space (the treatment of residents and response measures are posted on the Government of Moscow portal).
Many do not just pay monthly receipts, but carefully follow up on what is written there as the home.
Public awareness about the rights of owners and the obligations of resource and management organizations is very high.
In addition, Moscow examines the rationale of the rates for housing and municipal services, as a small part of the budget goes to grants and benefits for many categories of population.
It's probably all together, and it explains the peaceful situation in Moscow.
Is everything supported by regional authorities?
Maybe it's time to change the place of work?
Turkey's gombit.
Will Erdogan be able to renounce friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, issued a U.S. ultimatum, proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fathull Gulen, an Islamic preacher charged with the organization of a coup d'état.
He said so, speaking in front of his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on Americans to give up support to the "Terrorist Organisation of Phethholicists".
This is not Turkey's first statement, in which the United States calls for a change in its position.
Experts believe that Turkey's divorce to the West is increasing and may lead to a new attempt to change the country.
"In the early days or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and the FETO ("Terrorist Fetholist Organization").
Or the organization of the FETO revolutions, or democratic Turkey.
It should make this choice," quoted the Anatolian Agency as referring to Erdogan, which was held in Ankara on Wednesday evening.
The President of Turkey, on the other hand, had urged the United States to comply with its requirement for the first time after the riot.
Recall that, on the night of 16 July, the Turkish military high-ranking representatives in Turkey were attempting to establish a legitimate authority in the country, as well as attempting to live by the head of the State.
However, after Recep Erdogan addressed the population, the rebellion was suppressed and its organizers and participants were arrested.
A total of some 8,000 people were suspected of being teachers and scientists, besides soldiers.
According to Recep Erdogan, their teacher was Fethollah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
Also, Erdogan's supporters have allowed the Americans to be involved in the coup.
All claims in his address were rejected by refusing to issue Guilen and advising him to change the tone.
The most recent statement made by the representatives of the House was that of Erdogan on his visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - he insists on himself and also makes demands on other Western partners.
"Ankar will cease to fulfil its obligations under a migration agreement with the Euro Union if Brussels does not call the date for the abolition of visa restrictions on Turkish citizens," said Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Omer Chelic on 9 August.
He said that, as the EU requires, the introduction of an amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act by Ankara would endanger Europe's own security.
It should be noted that on 1 August, German Vice-Chairman Zigmar Gabriel demanded Turkey to end the Euro Union's commitment to open borders for migrants to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words responded to the corresponding statement by the head of the Turkish media, Mr. Mevlut Chaušoglu.
Another provocative statement made by Chaušoglu last Wednesday, allowing Turkey to leave NATO.
The head of the Turkish MIDI did not rule out that the country would consider leaving the alliance if it did not meet its expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the field of defence is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign defence States - import rockets," Chavuschoglu said in an interview with Anadolu.
According to him, Turkey now needs to establish its own defence system on the basis of its technologies and to cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has been trying to cooperate with NATO member countries so far, but the results have not met us, and we have been looking for others," said the Minister.
The experts believe that all of this refers to Turkey ' s serious differences with the West and to the country ' s reorientation in the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expert Evgenie Minchenko believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go to a fierce confrontation with the West.
He is very involved in both the West and business, and in terms of the military (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think Erdogan will try to balance with the West by maintaining a framework for relations with the West.
Although, of course, it would be easier for Americans to see a fully obedient person on this post," explained the Aif.ru expert.
According to him, it was not excluded that the Turkish leader (no compensation for the EU, the requirement for visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Guilen from the United States) would be applied to him.
"The Recep Erdogan will face the deterioration of relations with both America and the European Union, and they will press on it on the humanitarian issue, for the dictatorial methods of the country's administration and so on," Minchenko said.
The head of the Political Information Centre, Alexei Muhin, admitted that the President of Turkey would change his view of relations with Russia as soon as he found it beneficial.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took a very strict position with regard to Russia and sought favor in all ways in the West.
For a very short time, the situation had changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again for a while.
I think Erdogan entered the period of human diplomacy.
If he is between the two Poles - West and Russia - he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Muhin said.
In his view, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to maintain political power in the country, and for this time he needs Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop supporting the United States.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States, which control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Consensus will therefore be reached with Turkey," the expert said.
In other words, the head of the Asia and the Middle East of Anna Glazaz is in line.
Turkey's relations with the EU and the United States are now strained enough, and this is primarily related to the internal policy that Erdogan personally pursues.
I think that this crisis will be intensified in relations, and in the light of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to re-load both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
The President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, said that they were willing to change their position on a number of issues concerning Syria, resolved relations with Israel, were actively politically interacting with Iran," explained AiF.ru Glazaz, which would allow the next step to be to normalize relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy now being pursued by Erdogan is a return to the foreign policy concept followed by Turkey before the beginning of the Arab revolutions.
"It was then that Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in the "no problems with its neighbours".
There have now been very successful visits by the President of Turkey to Russia and the African countries.
Therefore, this external policy vector will develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey's positions both in the regional and in the international arena," the expert said.
The vote believes that Turkey's return to previous relations with the EU will be incredibly difficult, now the question is whether the EU will be firmly responsible for Turkey, which can go to the opening of borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Infectious young doctors: Calls for new collective protests
Young doctors asked the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute about a new employment contract.
The Committee of Young Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) intends to request its full council to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC said that ministers had not been able to answer questions about the employment contract.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted to cancel the employment contract agreement agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, President JDC Ellen McCort said that the Government continued to "keep silent" about the problems that she said had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said, “In view of the situation, the leader of JDC voted for the rejection of the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiation on all your issues.”
In response to the silence of the Government, the leader of JDC today made an official request to the extraordinary meeting of the BMA to approve a continuous programme for the expansion of collective protests from early September.
Spor led to the participation of young doctors in the six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of BMA's younger doctors, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after voting to cancel the agreed working conditions that BMA recommended.
He told the BMA members that the deal was good to be accepted during the meetings in advance of the vote of 54,000 young doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that this work contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: Alliance of Bads?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague to the courtroom in St. Petersburg, I felt that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
It was handcuffed, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile seemed tense, and he barely made a heat out of even his own held standards.
Recep Tayip Erdogan, in contrast, has repeatedly spoken of his "old other" Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level but even above.
On the next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was supposed to be back.
But the prolonged cold coming from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory comments: Turkey had hit the Russian miner on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was unbearable.
Mr. Putin was angry with the angry tyrant, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
Grief was even stronger on the basis of the alleged friend.
The restoration of real trust would be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
Over the months, media-controlled States have carried out a shocking, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it was shown that the Turks should be held guilty of everything.
The most serious were the allegations of the high-level leadership, that Mr. Erdogan's own family was engaged in illegal oil trafficking in the Syrian zone controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He firmly denied it.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin had received an apology he had requested from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim to win its kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of the proclamation of peace are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he's almost turned off his post last month when he tries to turn around.
Turkey's repeated terrorist attacks were clearly shocked by him too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit heavily — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast each year.
The amount fell sharply to almost 90 %.
With regard to Russia, tour operators and charter companies here, of course, feel relief when flights are finally renewed.
They put on the peak end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
Even this week, public television predicted more cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products are released again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," said the newspaper.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara's evil in the West because it thinks it's a weak response to a coup attempt.
Add to this her prolonged dissatisfaction at the sharpest pace of the EU accession talks and Mr. Putin's move, which is trying to take advantage of the cold and gradually destroy Turkish relations with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won the winning prizes with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup d'état.
Consider this data for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of changing the regime.
Thus, the summit in this brilliant seafront courtyard allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as "the alliance of evils": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West unite forces.
However, despite the public demonstration of reconciliation, these two remain at a significant level.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing parties.
It may only be said that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, until two presidents gave a press conference, they did not even touch the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility, and taking into account the possibility of a complete disaster, when a member of NATO struck a Russian reaction trigger, it was better that two leaders were at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS should be included in the role of the back office, according to the executive director of the bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
The bank has retreated from them since he left almost eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies used RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
He was supported by millions of sponsorship funds for international sport, from Cuba to the Wembledon Andy Murrea.
But it has now been decided that it is appropriate to allow more national fires to take place in the first place.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with the Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales all references to RBS, including the external headquarters and the fund exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the banking of private individuals that will have more influence -- outts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during a tour of clients and staff in Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brand RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be employed, because we are now becoming more brand banks."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we have no more global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its population groups, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship support for the six-nation Cuba, and it will increase the profile of various brands in the sponsorship of sport.
"This is the right time for us to move the brand bank, because on the basis of (we asked ourselves) how we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the Executive Director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and close all those brands.
But with the work we did, focusing on the needs of customers, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can return those fires again, so I think it's time.
Franci Dettori comes to 3,000 winners with a victory in New Market in Prussia
The kids are scattering champagne after a double in New Market brings it to 3,000 wins.
Jokoy Franky Dettori won his 3,000th British victory in New Market on Friday.
He came to this outstanding note by means of his second night winner on his home road, at the Prussian, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey, which has reached this outstanding mark in smooth jumps.
It follows Sir Gordon Richards, Long Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Idder and Willie Carson.
A three-time Juicy Kidtor, who won the Ghayyar earlier, said, "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here, too.
I'm very glad it happened in New Market, because I've been here 30 years ago.
It's not a big world event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free from cases, and I'm very rude.
Children receive applause when they are available after victory
Two jockeys achieved such a score in obstacles jumping: a Jockey champion Richard Johnson and a retired 20-time champion, Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4300 wins for a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career wins
Franki is one of the best jockeys of the modern era, and it is not surprising that he has reached that mark, which so few have reached.
He's stylish and strong, but that's his tactical shirt that distinguishes him from others in the gym.
He was a great representative for jumping, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans in this sport for years.
I told Franky a few weeks ago in Epse, he would have brought 6,000 winners if it wasn't just a hot jump!
And if you're serious, Franky has been leading the winners in Britain for over 30 years, which is very good to see.
He's an energetic character that's good for British jumpers, but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Franci Dettori highlighted this outstanding note with a firm's hard-to-eating horse
From the racing finish to the racing jumps, Franka Dettor is a symbol of British smooth jumps for two decades.
It's been taken off and dropped.
Many of the winners of the big jumps, including his so-called "Vegal Semerka" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the aviation and the temptation to disqualification due to doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed tremendous will to address the challenges of skepticism and return to form.
And he may not have finished for some time. The Children said earlier that they would like to continue to participate in the contests, at least by the age of 50.
Putin releases Sergei Ivanov's head of administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his head of the administration of Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin’s trusted neighborhood for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as a representative of the environment and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin "has decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian President's administration," but did not mention the reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Wyno, was appointed successor.
Mr. Wynno, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, he completed the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGIMO) and served in Tokyo.
Later, he was the head of the President ' s protocol and the Government ' s apparatus, reports the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as heads of State in the design of draft laws and control of how your instructions are implemented.
Putin told one Russian channel on Friday that Ivanov had requested him to be released from the post and recommended that the war replace him.
Are the smiles convincing?
It's a move that has cost Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet Security Service, KGB.
As the head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on public television, both men stated that the head of the administration had resigned on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles on the camera, it is a few who have been convinced here — especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the unforeseeable consequences of a fight for power?
Until no one knows.
But the official statement is that a person who was once agitated as a potential president suddenly wanted to manage Russian environmental policy was met with tremendous skepticism.
In Putin's comments, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "This is true that in early 2012, I asked you to trust me with this very difficult post, even if you can say, a four-year problem post.
Well, I've been the head of the president's administration for four and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the Public Security Service of the KGB, as was Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which was replaced by the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanova among the five people he trusted most.
At one time it was considered that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin ' s second term, since Putin ' s third term would contradict the Constitution.
However, this post was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the presidency three and a half years later.
The star's "I mean as a criminal" Thomas Gibson was fired after a fight with a producer.
Gibson was involved in the show's funerals in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotner, apologized on Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative differences in the land and differences in opinion.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how the Gibson character will be removed from the show, which is being followed by the FBI's team of agents, is expected to be later, according to statements by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
A 54-year-old actor who had previously played a leading role in Netma Darma and Greg was at the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love "I think as a criminal" and have put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there before the end, but it's not going to be possible now.
I just want to thank the screenwriters, the producers, the actors, our amazing team, and, most importantly, the best fans that the show could only dream of.
It is noted that the show will return with its twelfth season on 28 September.
A mystery: fish landed in Banfa garden
A man from Banfa sought help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Baine believes that 75 fish could be fish left with water dead.
Bane, who lives 500 metres from the sea, posted a plot of this obscurity in Periscope in the hope that someone would be able to shed light on the appearance of two-dime fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected with Fife
Project of 1.35 billion pounds now to be completed by May 2017
Engineers combined North Spring and Queensferry Crossing, which means that the bridge is now connected with Fife.
This is the first of the four smacks between the fires of the furnace, which are now approaching the completion of all three bridges.
Fif's bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 walls of bridge.
The project of 1.35 billion pounds is now to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Kit Brown visited the square today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of the art of engineering really epicly in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the smear between the radiator and the bridge is a virtuoso operation using extremely accurate collection permits.
A total of about 79 per cent of the total bridge deck now on the spot, for the last section of the deck, the concrete cover is being flown to the Rosite today, which means that everything is ready to take place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Director Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first blast on each bridge project is always a significant wave.
In this stunning project, this smelting is the most modern construction art.
After the last section of the road deck and its connection to the expanding North Pillar’s road deck, we were then left with the rest of the border on the north — or the shore.
This has been done by drawing the distance of the northern approach to 700 millimetres south.
It was a very large operation at the same time.
It is large because the evaporate of 222 metres, weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be raised at an angle of about 3 per cent.
It is understandable, for the permission of the team was short - lived — just a few millimeters in each direction.
Luckily, it all went very well.
Salvation in the Gulf of Moelfr: Three men were "lucky to stay alive"
Three men were "lucked to stay alive" after they were released from the fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station was alarmed at 13:20 in British summer time on Friday, after the team saw the incident in Moelfr Bay.
Three men were all trying to reach a safe place, while their ship continued to walk.
"We've seen their ship circling around with them and assuming worse," said Moelfre Vince Jones.
" Fortunately, until the time we came down to the water, the strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were saved through a local fishing vessel, and a third man was found exhausted and trapped without a rescue shelter for 60 years.
All of them were boarded and delivered to the rescue station.
Jones said, "The three men who are thrown into the water are lucky that they are alive and completely harmless.
The boat's engine had an accident bomber, but he somehow got off the man who was running the boat when she got up.
Someone's been saving these guys today.
Pokémon Go, worthy desire for health and happiness
It's fun to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children are no longer on the street to play, preferring to spend their free time watching the screen, has been a complaint to many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go poisons people from the couch and engages in some physical activity.
The time in the screen was initially limited by television, then video and recently by smartphones.
It is so good to see that the technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the slow involvement of Pokémon Go, an application based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (after the series of multifilms, playing cards and other responses).
Like many other pop-cultural events, all of this has been lost a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was then delayed due to a massive response by the servers.
In the days considered, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, smartphone games are going to look for Poquemons that are tracking the GPS and, being discovered, can be 'photographed' (by the screen on your phone) or 'records'.
The generation that played the game, being younger, joined the slow act of drifting away from the savages to find it.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps that are being taken by “normal” people every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which is tracking 35,000 users, recently reported Washington Post that within two days of the start of the game, the number of people who were tracked by 30 minutes per day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing in Pokémon Go, it just sees the initial data on the level transition.
Many health campaigns that convince people that they are "at least 30 minutes", "get up from the couch" and "be active every day", have not found a response because most health messages are boring and speak to people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who practice regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to adjust weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that she pushes people out on the street to do what they love.
Thus, the three basics of health include movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on their own.
As usual, there are pregnant infants who are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone can knock on the door.
So what?
It's a break.
Although smartphone applications, such as Fitbit, were able to track our physical activity before, they did not give us an opportunity to practice as this game does.
The news is coming, and the use will slow down in time.
However, because of the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will unite applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to want to be more active, in good form and healthy.

Simona Bailey wins the gold of the absolute championship in female gymnastics
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the sum.
Simone Bayls is invincible for all of this.
Dynamic on the stand.
Unforced on the shore.
That's a sex breaker.
That's amazing.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went up to the title of the champion at the absolute championship on Thursday, putting the rest of the world in a convincing demonstration under the utmost Olympic attention.
Its total ball 62.198 was sufficiently distant from the silver medalist and partner of the "Final Peterka" team, Eli Riceman and the Russian bronze medalist Ali Mustafin.
The U.S. Balls is at the gymnasium bridge during the final of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byils became a fourth-ranking American woman who won the title of the champion of absolute victory and the fifth in all, confirming her reputation as the best of her generation and, perhaps, at any time.
She was upset when they showed her final general ball and her long journey to this point ended.
This achievement puts her in the same league as very rare athletes, such as Michael Felps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Byils has spent the last three years mastering his sport, winning 15 world championship medals -- including 10 gold -- with such stunning programs in their mix of love and precision that the 1984 Olympic Championship, Mary Lu Retton, called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One final test was expected in Brazil, not as much comparison between the Bayls and the others in this area as between her and the cargo of high expectations.
Something less than going back to your family's home in Spring, Texas, with the pride of gold medals, would be considered an unwarranted expectation.
Simona Bails from the United States, left, and Eli Riceman are included after winning gold and silver, respectively, at the final of the women's individual absolute championship at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Byils earned the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final deal for a simple party that retired from the coordinator of the Marta Karoli National Assembly.
While Bailey insisted that she never looked to the future during her long journey to the top, that was not the case.
Part of her program of free exercise — including her business tour — is set up in Latin American music, which would come directly from home on the street right outside the Olympic Arena Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was touched by her grandfather and grandmother, starting to walk as a child and an open mother to coach Amy Burman during a visit to the hall where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She has not played any match since the summer of 2013 — a field of transportation that should continue for as long as Bailey wants.
Although Mustafa received a small benefit through two treatments, it was a peace.
Gymnastic and free exercise — where Bailey protects the world’s champion — lies in ambush.
She went out again with 15.433 on the edge and ended with 15.933 on the floor.
Raisman gently wrapped her up as they waited for the final account — the pure formality — and the tears appeared around the shining red with the white and blue subjugations for the eyes of the Bailey when the idea that she had ever written in the cut album was realized.
Raisman's speech was a small place four years ago, when she shared a third place, but lost Mustafin's bronze in Thai.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, whom Americans call "baby" was a lot ahead.
She sent a crowd kiss after her free exercise, covered by a return, which sometimes appeared to be a matter.
With regard to Bayls, the 19-year-old virus tweet from the beginning of this week is now of entirely new importance:
Police: 3 victims of a serial killer shot while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the most deadly attack on the first serial killer of Phoenix for the last decade, sat in the car, spoke and listened to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Roshel Liner, Stefani R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot on 12 June when their car was parked on the road, the authorities said.
The offender did about eight gunshots, standing on the passenger side of the vehicle, after being hidden on another vehicle, is reported in the report.
The police claim that a triple murder is not apparently the result of a robbery, since the offender has not taken the wallets or $2,900 that were available to one of the adult victims.
A police representative, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that he had shot the investigators to see if he had been involved with the four previous attacks.
All seven people were killed and two others were injured as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas for four months.
"This is happening in the residential area before home," said Howard K.K.O., CBS branch, early this month.
Suspectedly, several vehicles, including the Korean Nissan end of the 1990s, the black BMW end of the 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln, were used.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked to each other and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and was later terminated.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were killed.
The Witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, aimed at empty pickup half an hour before a triple murder, which they believe was the case of a serial killer.
The investigators found the gilses and pulled the bullet out of the seat and the fragments of the bullet out of the motor section.
Mother of a 6-year-old child with a microcephalus: "It's better."
Like most of the six - year - olds, Edmund Pixivto loves drinking, playing games, and, of course, his mom.
But unlike most of her peers, Edmund microcephalus is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pixivto did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I could not do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign it.
What really isn't true is that you're going to sign on it," she said.
Her and her husband told Vincent that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized medical facility.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing that anymore," Pixivto explained.
Edmund's walking through the halls.
Edmund did not sit or use until he had completed three, and he has not yet spoken.
But it's slowing down some stages.
He's on the sidewalk and he's on his bike.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and drink.
Elizabeth is showing the gesture that Edmund thought of "please contact me."
"We're teaching his sign language," said Pixio CBS News.
But not just the usual language of gestures, she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur as a result of a number of different circumstances: genetics such as Edmunda, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as cancer and Zika.
Symptoms and forecasts may differ significantly.
It's too early to talk about how it's going to happen to people who are infected with Zika's virus.
Pixive remembers emotional losses because of an uncertain future.
I always said what was going to happen?
What's going on?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifetime forecast because I don't expect someone to really tell me.
But Pixivto has an encouraging advice for mothers of children with major defects due to Zik.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flood is the cause of the rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The strong rains and widespread floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, with more rains expected to fall over the state by Saturday, including.
Many rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and South Mississippi have left the shores and are threatened with widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Meteorological Service reported.
Governor Louisiana John Bell Edwards said that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance had already come to the affected income.
Mike Styl, representative of the Office of the Governor for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that high-water, boat and sandbag transport requests were being made.
Styl said that only the arrival of Tangipahoa had asked for tens of thousands of sand bags.
The risk of flooding remains in force until Saturday on most of southern Louisiana.
The Weather Service stated in a statement that additional 3 to 5 inches could be attached to the area.
In southern Alabama, the weather was expected to continue until Friday, as the rain continued to flow to the Mobil area.
The Comit River near Baton-Ruze and the Amit River near Dan Springs, both in Louisiana, were projected to establish a record of the flood level in the past exits.
Synoptic Alex Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburban areas near Baton-Ruz.
He also said that the flooding going down the stream at Assensen's arrival was a threat, as these exploding rivers would slowly reach the Morp Lake.
Tikfo River, the southern border of the Mississippi state in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest ever recorded level at 9 a.m. on Friday.
The rescuers were still excavating people from the floods in the districts of Amit and Wilkinson in the south-west state of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his passport were among those who were saved early Friday next to Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that the waters of Biver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose quickly at night.
He said that another bird who lives nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water continued to rise," said Hansford.
She reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest stream she'd seen in 48 years of living here.
Hansford said he and all his family had disabilities, and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers saved all three with the help of an army truck and delivered them to a fire station in Gloster, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood was “quickly spreading”, as the rains continued, noting that the officers were considering the evacuation order.
Krautmann says that one observer next to Livingstone reported a drop of 13.75 inches of rain from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil was oversowed with rain from the environment.
The heavy rains and the flooding of the streets have led to the rescue of residents from Tangipahoa's homes and the abolition of five school districts, states the authorities.
WWL, CBS branch, reports that Tandjipahoa, a consultant, told about 200 houses that were heated.
The people were evacuated to two churches, but both of them are now being burned.
The President of Robbie Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals in high water.
The guests were opened in the city of Amit and the city of Hammond to receive those who were evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water begins to decline," he said.
In the city of Hammond, Tanjipahoa, about two dozen streets were closed because of high water, and sandbags were available to deliver to residents in hopes that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said urban manager Lacey Landrum.
It's on its way to become a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison district, the head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, reported that the floodwaters continued to be on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several houses were registered as heated on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, a store manager at Shopr Value Foods in Amit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Tauson, "and she's still flying to the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "pulled", remains alive after shooting in Philadelphia
Police reported shooting at the 6-year-old boy in Philadelphia, registering a second shooting at the 6-year-old in the city this week.
Grandmother and granddaughter introduced him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandmother and grandfather say Brown received numerous gunshot wounds, including his breath, leg, hand and life, but was aware when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot, his little body was cut off by bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melendez.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is counted in the hospital in critical condition and has survived several operations.
The family told the station what was expected of him.
He had to go to first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown.
They also shot three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-olds was in critical condition; two other victims were registered in a stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at the front seat near the 29-year-old in critical condition, reports the station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be shot.
The investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that it appears that there was a shooting between several armed people.
Giles of semi-automatic weapons attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons have taken place.
It seems that it was certainly a long battle.
There were bricks on the street on both sides of the road.
Therefore, according to all, there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting," police station Captain Anthony Ginaldi reported.
Many homes and cars in the area were also busy.
No arrests were made, and the police reportedly watched video surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was beaten in the hand of a silk ball on Tuesday when she played in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby, and Lori?
That's what I call a woman's Olympic gymnast this year and for several reasons.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, three gymnasts, Simon Bayls, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lauri" Ernandes, have played the key role in this gathering.
The composition of this collection, complemented by Eli Riceman, who is a Jew, and Madison Coshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This collection looks like America at last.
This also strengthened the black-haired and Latino-American female presence at the top of this type of sport.
For the last four years, the female gymnastics number was one African American.
Last year Simon and Gabby were Nos1 and No2.
It's powerful.
In the last Olympics Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed.
The world could now be a witness of the incredible three-time Peace Championship Simone Bayls, Douglas and Lori Ernandes, who perform unexpected, yet virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American gold medal winner in a female individual absolute championship.
And a fellow at Eli Riceman's collection made a silver coin.
We're witnessing this kind of sport, but it doesn't look like it in gymnastics all over the country.
Simona, Gabby and Lori all chose the same path as Eli and Madison to form an Olympic assembly.
They are "final five", because the next Olympic gymnast will have only four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of Martha Karoli's training.
But in fact, gymnastics is expensive sport, and gymnasiums are first trained in private gymnasiums supported by parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travel, form, contributions to meetings, hotel services (for coaches and their gymnasiums and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnasts are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are located where gymnasiums receive everything from their training, and this is a expensive and long-term duty for gymnasium families.
Amy Burman, coach Simona Baileys, and Maggie Hani, coach Lori Ernandes, both trained their sportsmen since they took up high school.
We must create a more affordable and affordable gymnastics education for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and expensive gymnasts in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and Latin American) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide a high-quality gymnast for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to exhausting work, discipline and resilience to mind.
This combination has a positive effect on good health, school success and work throughout life.
It's the inspiration of this assembly that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and that's wonderful.
Sports is so important, especially for girls.
It's such a great time now.
Thank you, Simona, Eli, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the "Women's Force" in the victory of the Olympic gold team and for motivating so many girls of different origin to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Young doctors took notice of further beatings after the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers hoped to conclude the dispute on the change by agreeing a treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce this treaty, said that NHS was on "nothing land" and that any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first young doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in nighttime work and out of time to improve service.
Dr. Ellen McCott, Chairman of the Committee of Young Doctors" BMA, said yesterday evening in a statement, "Young Doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it is undergoing a crisis of labour force and that it cannot be applied fairly to all doctors."
It was only eight weeks before the first group of doctors was transferred to a new contract, necessary progress, and time on the basis.
The attempt by WMA to settle disputes by negotiations was met with an unwillingness to take action and sometimes full silence by the Government.
And this despite the promise of Jeremy Hunt last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hantu needs to act now, encourage introduction and respond to the fears of younger doctors.
If he does not do so, then the younger doctors are sure that they are ready to organize the next rounds.
At the end of April, about 13,000 scheduled operations and 100,000 hospital admissions were delayed, while nurses and consultants were attracted to the substitution of the medications.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute on the change by agreeing an amended treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants a better payment for 54,000 young doctors who will be subject to the treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS Employers, urged younger doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: "There is little or nothing that can be achieved by the strikers, but there is pressure on those already working on the edge of the teams and services, and it causes anxiety, physical pain and disorder to the patients, the residents and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken with the Committee of Young Doctors and have responded positively with the Department of Health and others to their concerns regarding the role of supervisors and corporate information policies.
Workers hoped that the continued positive support on other important topics — staff distribution, flexibility of training, additional training for those returning after a career break, the value of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay differences in medicine — were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to meet the conditions reached by WMA in November, February and May.
Preparation for 2 £ per day may reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attack are expected to take 2 £ a day after the authorities have recommended that it be given more people and for longer periods.
The anti-ticagrelor medicine reduces the risk of repeated approaches for people with heart disease.
The product is already appointed for 12 months after heart attack, reduced risk of stroke or new onset.
The NICE National Health Service of the United Kingdom advised that it be given to its people for four years in order to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE National Health Service has now advised that it should be given to its people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs with approximately 140,000 people in England each year, and a further attack or stroke occurs in the fourth.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat on the walls of the arteries and the formation of blisters.
If the bottle is broken into parts, this may cause a thrombosis that blocks blood access to the heart and causes heart attack.
And if the trombone moves, it can move through the bloodstream and block the blood to the brain, causing stroke.
People who have already made one move are at greater risk of getting another.
Tikagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold as Brilique, reduces the risk by making the trombone less likely.
The project of NICE, published today, recommends that people give 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the existence of effective secondary prevention methods, about four people who have already had heart attack, another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences, will occur.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes to people who have already transferred heart attacks.
In the pre-recommendation of ticagrelor, we are pleased to have the opportunity to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited after the expiration of three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer.
The culture of ownership of the PC enables the falsification of the count of votes in Muslim areas
Ex-Mer Tauer-Hamlets Lutfur Rachman was removed from office last year because of corruption, using a Government account
The culture of political correctness has led to the closing of the eyes, which has been reversed by the widespread falsification of the count of votes in the Muslim communities, according to information from the Government ' s devastating report published today.
The former member of the Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Eric Pickles, is in violation of police criticism, election observers and city administration for ignoring evidence of election violations due to “excessive sensitivity to racial affiliation and religion”.
The former secretary of the local communities, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the intimidation of religious voters was so strong that the police had to allow the border to be placed outside the electoral premises to protect the terrorized voters.
He suggests that voters take personal certificates to prove who they are when they vote.
At this point, voters should only specify their name and address.
The report even proposes to put unscrupulous blacks on people's fingers when they give their ballots, in order to exclude someone from voting twice.
There is a need to provide better protection for the informants, Sir Eric said.
It calls for greater press access to the documents of the local council and decisions adopted by the informal committees or working groups.
"This is done not only to protect against fraud in elections, but also to protect the local Government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that is coming with it by hand," he said.
The report was ordered by the Downing Street due to a voting scandal in Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, a special court dealing with elections decided that the current mayor, Luftur Rachman, had to be removed from office in connection with a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rachman "cinicly accused" of religious feelings of his Muslim community and had forced his critics to silence them, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman said, "He had his campaign based on the duty of believing Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes cast doubts or were the result of a person ' s vote, representing someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concerns about the fraud of the mail vote in which the senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in his photo, made several recommendations for the cleaning of the voting system, including the requirement to give his/her identity certification to prove who you are.
His report stated: “The evidence of the pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, was presented to vote at the will of older people, especially in communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
"It was feared that... State institutions had closed their eyes to such behaviour due to the excessive sensitivity of "political correctness" to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the removal of political activists from work with postal ballots in order to stop the “collection of votes”.
The report of Teresa May also calls for intensive checks at the time of registration to prevent the use of the list of voters for immigration fraud and privileges.
An option is considered to require the voter to issue a person ' s certificate before the vote.
Use unsweetened blacks on people's fingers as soon as they drop their bill to prevent someone from voting twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year limitation on applications for automatic mail vote.
Remove political participants from the campaign and activists from the work of the pre-filled and post-voting polls.
To empower the police to establish boundaries around the polling stations.
To amend the law in order to facilitate the prosecution of people in intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the National Act 1983.
To photograph illegally at the polling stations.
To require only English to be used at the polling stations (except Wales).
Enhancing training to ensure that staff force the voters to go to the booth by one.
Sir Eric was furiously attacking the city police, claiming it was "suffering", that no criminal charges had been filed after the case of Tower Hamlets.
“The electoral court has declassified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal actions,” he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
It also criticises the unresolved " check-ins for a branch " of the electoral registration of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: “The most recent court ruling in the Tower Hamlets was a signal for prosecution.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, and the disturbing and hidden dissemination of electoral fraud and the denial of some organs threatens this good reputation.
Mindful of Kate's bicycle analogue and other doubles of the Olympics in Rio
The 2016 Olympic Fantasy in Rio this week came up with the idea of the French bicycle driver Polin Ferran-Prevo, which appeared to be impressive like the Duke of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old participant in the Olympic Games is not the only sportsman fighting for gold this summer, who can be praised by his own famous twin — at least, by reports in the shorts.
Thus, in favour of Igr Rio and all the famous people on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has made a list of Olympics with more than the surface similarity to Hollywood stars.
Catcher and wolf: U.S. Men's team member Brady Ellison, left compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's bicycle bike, many people online have been able to point out how a certain tower could be a twin of Leonardo DiCaprio superstar.
A member of the U.S. Men's Team, Brady Ellison, was the cause of a hurricane on Twitter after his images of a horrifying Volk star with Wall Street Street appeared.
And in fact, the priest found out about the sorceress' madness and admitted that he had heard that he was like Leo since he was a child.
"I don't personally see a huge likeness, it may be except for vegetation on the face," Brady Huffington Post said.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of London's most popular comparisons will no doubt indicate even more this year: the striking similarity between British conjugation Greg Raserford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Ali Mustafina, with her large expressive eyes, is said to be an exact copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Stefan.
In the South African swimming pool, Cameron Van der Burg has been compared to the star Choir Matthew Morrison for many years.
Going to more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a "sport version" of the "Start" actor.
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who could be praised by similar heavy holes and losses.
A silver medalist from Russia, Julia Efimova, can be praised not only with the same warm skin and bright hair as Annalinn McCord's actress, while Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, according to fans, is like Joseph Gordon Levitta's sports version.
Great Women: The Hope Solo Football Star, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, right, have the same faces and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similarities
Creating the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason based on the same appearance of the couple
One Twitter user recently called on the site to announce his caution that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical."
In fact, the U.S. football star and Dexter's actress have an amazingly similar form of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of the actress Lory Linnie, as well as the winning golden medal of Gabby Douglas, who can boast of his own beautiful wide smile, which resembles the smile of the star Gabriel Union.
Commentator Olympiada at CBC apologized for saying that the Chinese fleet had died as a pig.
Analysis Byron McDonald's fourth place at the 14-year-old Ay Janhanh women's esophagus, 4x200 m in the middle of CBC viewers in the direct broadcast of the Olympics
The Canadian advertising company CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese puppies "started as he" and "dead as a pig" during the flooding.
Commentary Byron McDonald thought that his microphone was turned off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final female stage 4x200 m free style.
It was possible to hear McDonald, who was drawn to the CBC's team of commentators to "distribute her color," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese took out a ball, kid."
Too excited, she started like a pig, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
A 14 - year - old Chinese sailor, Ianhan, missed the second stage of the esophagus at 1:57.79 — for 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Rack, allowing the Canadians to withdraw from China.
Viewers throughout Canada responded quickly to the network after being shaken by tone and using expressions
Emmet McFarlan tweeted, "In fact, the CBC dictator just said that the 14-year-olds from China were 'dead as a pig'?"
This idiot didn't realize they were still in the air."
About Ay Janhan from China in the finals of the women's esophagus 4x200 m in free style said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has pulled out a ball, baby."
The Twitter criticism immediately broke down on Byron McDonald, and many urged him to quit.
Twitter users didn't stop when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradiz, wrote: 'Nothing wrong #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who had transferred the CBC, apologized in the direct air for the McDonald's comment, saying, 'We apologize for the comment on the landing in the air'.
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.
The SBI has concluded that more than 90 people have apologized in response to this statement.
A friend of the commentator Scott Russell had to apologize to McDonald
CBC then copied and sent their excuses to over 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments
Telesce was also quick to apologize and to publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to go into the air.
Yesterday night, we acted quickly to apologize to our viewers in the direct air and to our subscribers in the satellites.
Let us make it clear that the comments made by Byron relate to the presentation of the crew, not to the person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald apologized in the direct air and tried to clarify his comment, claiming that he did not think his words were interpreted as an assault on the person.
'I would like to take the moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's esophagus,' he said on the release of the CBC Olympics.
'I've been talking about the speech of a coward, not about her personally.'
'It is only clear that no disrespect was meant, and I am very sorry.'
Buyer Primark insulted a woman who did not really copy the lower white in the middle of the store
The buyers didn't know where to take a look when a woman found out to sample the shirts on the floor with stores in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she illustrated how she looked at them, walled them, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually killed four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkston.
Primark Shop of Bouverie Place Trade Centre in Folkston, where a woman used tricycles before putting them back on the pole
The mother of the two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after the example of the lower white woman, the pregnant woman, "was dressed and gone out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the trade hall, she took a couple of rabbits from the window, took off her own colognes and rabbits, and fed them.
"She didn't try to find somewhere else to do it -- she was just standing there, unscrupulous."
"They all got up when she took off her shirts again, and they obviously didn't like her because she put them back on the pole."
She did the same with three other couples before finally decided that there was nothing she would like to wear and go out again.
"It doesn't look like she cared about who was watching her, or what she thought of the person who finally bought the rabbits she was looking at."
The 33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent said, "What's wrong with thinking that someone's going to take the house of the rabbits that someone else has already worn, and they're not hurt."
It happened on Tuesday day.
Davidson added, "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items from the sale after she left, well and so on."
"I don't want to come home with a new pair of women's trousers and find out that the other woman was in and out of them, and they weren't out of the way."
The representative of Primark reported: "Prmark knows what happened at our stock store in Folkston on Tuesday, 9 August".
All the goods in question were removed from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself From Gun Attacks using a ball
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Ron Mizarca, the master of the Federation of the Magi in New York to find out how to deal with armed robberyrs at a close distance.
Whether they come to you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to kill the thief with his own weapons.
If they approach the back, according to Mizaraki, the first thing they have to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and 'release the line of fire'.
Then you bend the gun firmly between your forehead and your shoulders before hitting them with a free spot.
Then, while the attacker turns away from the pain, you thrust the gun out of his hand, beat him in the face, and leave behind the weapons on him.
For the armed, fit forward, the way to do the same is to remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grasp the gun and twist it so that the criminals can't shoot.
At the same time, shift your weight to the gun and hit the attacker with a ball in his chest, then pull the gun out of his pocket before he turns back and hits him.
Sounds complicated?
Look at the video to see how that's what Misraki is doing.
But remember, the safest way to get out of any robbery -- if you're not the master of the game -- is to give your money.
For the traveler, Jan Wright is conducting his language in the most dirty places in Europe
The British traveler has subjected his immune system and a red reflex to a serious test, bypassing some of the most destructive and disgusting places in Europe.
The leading author and author of Ján Wright's travel books, 51, from Suffolk, spoke in the euro banknote, Circa Piccadili's pearls, a smear of unity on the road and the Russian public phone to prove the power of their immune system.
Before going through every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going into.
But the experiment, which should become a film called the Guide to the Road of the Lizanne on the Inner Force, gave some surprising results.
The idea of licking the garbage button on a train that is used by thousands of others may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen shell.
During the entire trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and nurses about the increase in laying bacteria and their own health.
Luckily, nothing in the envelope brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for his tests on the strength of his pillow, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public periphery to the unitizable smear button, this task has undoubtedly tested its immune system.
In the film he was filming, he said, "From the very childhood, I was completely out of health, and I put a lot of stuff in my mouth from the ground, eating red and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused is a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test brain demonstrated the value of a luminometer of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison: only empty hands must be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to touch, after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while once the empty hands show less than 60
Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio filmed a film about a traveler called the Guide to the Internal Force, which shows the number of bacteria in different locations, for example in the toilet.
In the film, he said, "This is close to one of the worst things I've ever done in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to hurt anything because it's amazing.
"Direction of the Internal Force of Traveller-Lizuna" was removed together with the Finnish producer of Valio milk products.
The company provided Rita Valio Gefilus, which contains oxygen bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human bacterium and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice-President Valio on snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa said, 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to look at, and at the same time, could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended up with the idea of "don't call Jan."
They claim that interest in the health of the cough becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to place them in a much larger context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the health of the cough and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in the health of the pillow is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hackala, who was the film director, added, 'Let's say I'd lose respect for Jan, if he'd had done some of the things that I asked for, for example, a disgusting Russian toilet that was shown in the film.'
Of course, some things made Jan easier to get around, and some were rather harsh.
I'm glad that some of these bonds we've been able to get into a trap.
During a survey conducted in 2015 in Valio, 84 per cent of respondents linked oxygen bacteria to the good condition of the stomach and to oxygen, and 58 per cent said that they used at least at times products containing added oxygen bacteria.
The Hooligan family destroyed Saltash, the municipal house of Cornwall, before exile
The huligans left their municipal home with a loss of £ 50,000 after they had been evicted for intimidation of their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilkoka, were expelled from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they had been forced out of the real estate facility, the shocked officers of the housing cooperatives found the real estate in a condition that required repair.
The walls were left with the sawing holes, the semi-trailers were covered, the bricks were thrown out and the walls were rubbed with graffiti.
The family is now relocated and is expected to live in a private apartment
Donna McEvy, a deserter in Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid not to save him.
She said, 'This was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live that way.
There are many things that need to be weighed, because this property is likely to be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys foolish glory, and their name enjoys foolish glory.
In the case of three sons who have lived in the real estate since time, and the police report that the reign of terror caused by the family has included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of the inhabitants of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, disputes and abuse.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.
In several rooms of the house, which can be dreamed, there was an old garbage
Sex records in the house where drugs were sold in the past were exhausted
Neighbors say they saw the dragons on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after they had been granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The exile was welcomed by the neighbors who said that their lives had been transformed into a real hell.
One of them said, "She didn't care."
We lived with them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is amazing.
'This morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we didn't get used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the chairman of the Cornwall Housing Neighbourhood Group, said that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and regularly called the police
Musore and old toys were distributed below on the growing side of the municipal house
He added: 'This is a sign that the tenant could not accept any responsibility for the conduct of her and her family, because exile is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, since behavior was limited, and their actions must have been horrendous to its observers.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done to provide us with information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to neighbors and will signal that social behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but he said that they all had a little more than 20 at the time.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Disposal workers will now have to remove the musor’s chest that surrounds the house
In 2014, the police set up a search for the house and found more than 70 g of rope, as well as weights, related belongings, and $1700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after acknowledging himself as a drug owner of Class B with a view to supply.
She said that the money was paid for the funeral for her son, Li Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many houses were dug out of the entire surface.
Police say they will try to expel tenants who are not subject to the rental rules
Angela Crow, of the Devon and Cornwall police, stated that this exile had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
“This is a message for those who feel that they can act without accusing the accused, as well as for those who harm such conduct,” she said.
Criminal and anti-social conduct will never be allowed by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a low - flying military aircraft barely hit the beach
In the city of Aveiro, Portugal, tourists who worship in the sun were terrified of their lives
P-3C Orion Air Force Orion Portugal flew incredibly low
Air Force reported that it had conducted a training flight, but insisted on the lack of a risk to safety
That's the moment when the frightened tourists start panicking, while the moment the low-flying plane was hovering over the overcrowded beach.
The dramatic figures show a military aircraft that can hear the distance from the hunting grounds of the sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Respirators jumped on their feet as soon as they became aware of the noise of the aircraft's engines, but could not see what was moving in their direction through the cloud.
The incident happened last night not far from the city of Aveiro in Kosta-Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of the few breathers who published a video of a shocking spring in social networks, said, "He flew very low twice, and there was a moment when it showed that he was going to break up."
Nuno Arroga added, "I've been working on the serfing, and I swear, it was a feeling that the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on Aveiro's beach were terrified when the plane showed up from the fog and flew to a very low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft had conducted a training flight to detect fishing vessels at the shore, and had to be so low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said that the plane flew a little lower than usual due to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby hot forests, but the air force insisted that no one was in danger.
This summer, forest fires damaged Portugal’s property and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today made a statement that the pilot had to fly so low because of the circumstances — dense fog and the power of forest fires that had worsened visibility
The aircraft was trained and the pilot was instructed to detect fishing boats in the field
The HASSP system has been mandatory for more than a year, but most of the cafes and restaurants in Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Checks are becoming more active, and the business is threatened by fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system has been a risk analysis and critical control point for food producers and carriers, as well as companies in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (TS).
Business verifications by Rosuszüzer to comply with these standards in Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials have only paid fines for individual violations of the regulation (see "Creation of documents"...).
However, the non-implementation of the regulation in general affects the company in 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and in 1 million rubles for the second.
HASSP, as a system that takes into account the risks associated with and preventing food products, was conceived in the United States in the 1960s.
Then it was about food safety for astronauts.
The system is now being used in all food businesses not only in the United States but also in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating in the TS territory.
The development and implementation of the business system was 4 years old (HASSP was required in the TS Regulation in 2011).
However, entrepreneurs themselves and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the rule applies only to food products, not to restaurants, - explained the head of the General Council of Elena Certel.
Now everyone's trying to get lost.
The expected period for the renewal of the charter trips to Turkey at the end of August was beginning in September.
But they're not asking a curious question, because their target audience -- their families and children -- is already preparing for school, and experts are noticing.
Yesterday, the Alliance of Tourist Agencies sent a letter to the Government asking the charterers to be released.
“For many Russian tourists, the choice of quality and accessible sea rest is unacceptable, as most of the accommodation facilities are already banned in Krasnodar County and the Republic of Crimea until the end of September,” notes the authors of the letter and stresses that the opening of charter transport in August does not significantly affect the already existing demand for Russian maritime tourism.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union of Tourism (RST), if Russia and Turkey are quickly agreed upon, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected for a month.
A clear understanding of when the charters will be renewed until they are gone depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft can fly in September, even in August, if the tour operators are operating programmes and agree with airlines on board," said Pavel Romanianzov, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Office of RTD.
He said that it was possible to renew the charters - good news, but it was not too much of an impact on the market, because the main buyers of charter tubes - families with children - had returned from vacations and had prepared for school or vacations in other countries.
In the summer season, tours are purchased mainly by single travelers and couples.
Charting programmes can be expected for those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously," said Pavel Romanianzov.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists, if it will now offer a very budget proposal - between 50 and 60 thousand rubles for two tours, because there are people who are looking forward to a very cheap tour," says Valeria Rosental, Director General of Optio-Travel.
In other cases, it is not necessary to calculate the accommodation exactly - the main mass of travel is already planned.
Paul Romanians also believe that since there is a demand for regular travels in Turkey, the charters will also be requested, but the wait is not worth waiting for.
"For Turkey the launch of charters is now a repetition of the next season," said Paul Romanians.
"The opening of the charters in Turkey is a positive news for the next season," said Valeria Rubzova.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from NDFL provided by law from compensation payments within the limits of the approved rules relating to compensation for damage caused by injury or other health damage.
The issue of milk to workers employed in work with harmful working conditions is provided for in Article 222 TC FP.
However, the rules and conditions of extradition have been laid down by the Order of the Russian Ministry of Development, dated 16.02.2009, No. 45.
According to this document, free delivery of milk or other equivalent foodstuffs is made to workers on the days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions due to harmful production factors at work.
On the basis of those standards, the Russian FNSF concluded in the letter under consideration that, in accordance with paragraph 2(3), 217 CSFs were exempt from the NDF incomes of the milk paid to workers on working days with harmful working conditions in accordance with the Standards and the conditions approved by the Order of the Russian Ministry of Development of 16 February 2009, No. 45n.
Moscow's Gastrobank remained without a CB license.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew a licence to conduct banking operations with the credit organization of the Shareholders Commercial Bank GAZSTROIBANK, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, AKB GAZSTROIBANK conducted a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of cash in low-quality assets.
Adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a credible reflection of the value of the bank's assets led to a credit institution's finding of grounds for implementing measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in suspicious transit operations.
The bank shall be appointed by the temporary administration until the date of appointment in a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization under federal law have been suspended.
ACC "GAZROIBANK" is a participant in the investment insurance system.
It should be recalled that the payment of insurance compensation to bank contributors, including individual entrepreneurs, under Federal Law No. 177-FZ “Concerning the contributions of natural persons to the banks of the Russian Federation” provides for a 100% balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million rubs in total per contributor.
Payments, according to the Contribution Insurance Agency, will start no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the report, 335 seats were held in the RF banking system on 1 August 2016 for the assets of AKB GAZSTROIBANK.
London School, which joined IGIL, was killed in Syria
Cadiz Sultan, one of three British schoolchildren who left London last year to join the IGIL, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akunji said her family knew about her death in Rake, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Rakka, a wave of groupings in the country, as ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"It can only be hoped that the only advantage of this is that it is overcrowding and abdicating to others, that it is the risks involved when travelling to a military area, to convince people to make the same choice," Akunji said.
In February 2015 Sultan and two other schoolchildren from eastern London settled on a plane in Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan family said that she had married IGIL's warrior in Syria and had been widowed for several months.
Reed asserts that Clinton will remain loyal to Harland as a candidate for the High Court in the event of election
The leader of the Democrats in Senator Harry Reid said he was convinced that a democratic candidate in President Hillary Clinton would appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected as President.
The Republicans of the Senate blocked Garland's claim, and President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the majority of the group in Senator Mitch McConnell said that the next president would choose the man who would be able to replace the last judge of the Supreme Court, Antonina Skalia.
Reed said on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland as "some degree of confidence".
Ms. Reed later said that he did not speak directly to Clinton about whether she was going to bring Garland up and just made assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn't want to skip a boat with a new choice.
Harland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Colombia.
Reed said that the Republicans that block the Garland designation were "admissible" and "subsidiary" of the Republican candidate in President Donald Trampa.
He said Tramp wasn't fit for a post.
Traats claims that erotic calendars for women as well as for men
The Journal of Treats collaborates with the photographer David Bellmer to release the 2017 calendar, inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of being impressed, they are intended to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with captured museums.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine, with a large number of modeled models, differs from old-fashioned Playboys, because Playboy is for men.
I'm doing it for women.
Apparently, he thinks he's a calendar too.
"We need to return to the exhibition of an eternal and classically decorated figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the woman's body," said Shaw in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can take photos online or personally on open casts in Los Angeles and New York.
They'll give Moscow memories of unfavourable Internet stores.
In Moscow, they are going to release a memo that will tell us how not to become a victim of the Internet store.
This was reported in Roszuztwor, written by M24.
It is reported that the experts of the department are preparing a memo that will help citizens to choose the Internet Store correctly and identify possible fraud schemes.
The concept of this brochure provides for several sections.
These will be general information and legislative frameworks, rules for the delivery of goods, ways to protect their legitimate rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how to make the claim correctly and so on," said Rosustwig.
The memory is being developed to date.
It will then be located on the Roszuztwor website on Moscow, is also planned to release a printed version and distribute it to the Moscows.
Mid-Russia issued a statement calling the name of the second suspect in the organization of the conflict in Crimea.
Persons from Ukraine and Russia who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among them is Lord Evgenius Aleksandrovic and Zachay Andrei Romanovic.
"All of them give a good witness," says the report.
The former resident of the Zaporozian Evgenius Panov area, who was detained on suspicion of the organization of the crime in Crimea, admitted his guilt for questioning.
FAS charges Google for 438 million rubles.
The Russian Federal Anti-Money Service (FAS) has appointed an administrative fine for the Google Corporation of 438 million rubs, said on the agency's website.
"The fine for Google's violation of anti-monopoly legislation amounted to 438 million rubs.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine soon," said FAS Deputy Director Alexei Docenko.
During the FAS investigation, it was found that Google provides smartphones that are sold in Russia, the Google Play app shop only provided that other corporate apps will be installed on the device.
These annexes include a search system to be placed on the main smartphone screen.
Thus, the corporation violates article 10 of the Law on the Protection of Competition (use of dominant provisions).
We are confident that compliance with the requirement will provide an opportunity for competition in the mobile market in Russia, which will benefit our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act must be respected by all companies whose products are placed on the territory of the Russian Federation and by transnational corporations, including," noted the Head of the Office of Communications and Information Technology Management of the Russian Federation Elena Zaeva FAS.
The government suspects 16 Russian shops.
The "New Book" network was used to sell the book "50 days before my suicide."
The new bookstore network for the sale of the book Stace Kramer 50 days before my suicide, reports the Moscow City News Agency.
As reported in Rosustwor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be seen as “provocative or motivated by the suicide of children and adolescents”.
The District Court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products to children and decided to appoint a fine of 49 copies of the printed product seized by the Rosustauzer administration.
The source in the New Book confirmed that it was the production of Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that Moscow's largest bookstores were being screened for the book "50 days before my suicide".
In Moscow, the memory of the Unknown will come to an end.
In Moscow, the memory of the sculptor Ernst Unknown is going to be spent the night, TAS reports.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central Literature House.
Unfortunately, not all of them will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States personally.
It was therefore decided to set up this evening for those who wanted to exchange it on their own land," said the Russian Jewish Congress press.
There they noted that it was important for the widow of the sculptor Anna Grem and his friends all over the world.
In the evening, close friends were invited, including the poet Eugenia Eutushenko, artist Boris Messerer, President of the GMI for Puškina Irina Antonov, director Mark Rozovski, as well as Russian Culture Minister Vladimir Medinski, head of the Moscow Culture Department Alexander Kibovski, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Pechternik.
Earlier it was reported that the relatives of Ernst the Unknown planned to hold a panioid on a sculptor in New York, allegedly by 14 August.
The final consumer was guilty: who actually buys plastics?
The only men in the middle of the year love guilt.
And as long as you haven't let a section of the commentaries down with gross insults under the pseudonyms of NeAllUniversityThe Men of the Middle Ages, this claim is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the discussion about the recovery of the plates is due not to a boom among the generations of two thousand who want to penetrate the new material and the nostalgia of the middle years.
Those who recently bought a wine album c most likely are 45 to 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
It is also not just a favorite collection act - it is an emotional matter: older buyers are more likely to hold their feelings in their hands (56 per cent versus 53 per cent) and enjoy loneliness (69 per cent versus 66 per cent).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog was a television news reporter, the camera would follow me while I was walking the center of Soho's relived street, in a modest serum suit, and vesicularly vesicularly before the stop, laying my hands and saying something exciting, "Yes, let's see."
Yeah, let's see.
While Soho’s heart slowly fades from its charm and graces — the kidnappers, the coffee shoprs, the Paperchase shoppers now have half the buildings, once occupied by independent sellers — several musical shops with fantastic specialists remained.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to different people in some of these stores and try to assess their age and emotional mood by observation.
Glazgo Stuart, 55 years old, whom I walked from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably over 20 years old), in London on a noon date to meet, and to go to the shops for a few hours.
He's a collector, I'm asking?
"I believe so," he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 plastics.
These plates, as described above, (he sent me e-mail pictures, I didn't track him home), go through the walls of his hotel.
Its reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles is partly due to its income: it can now buy plastics that he could not afford when they just left, and buy the items he sold when he was young and on the mill.
"Many of what I'm buying is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, the things that came out when I was 11 or 12 things, for which I probably was too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plastics are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
It's my fault.
Wes, 25 years old who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets are in line with the profile of YouGov.
He noted, however, the new concern of the people who were affected by the noise in the media, the people who heard of the return and felt the duty to buy their old plates.
As far as I was concerned, people have been released from their collection, usually in 1998 or 1999.
Clients who once sold their vinyl to buy compact discs now sell their compact discs to buy their plastics," he says.
This may explain the boom among the returnees due to a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of plastics?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store, such as Phoenix, to understand that plastic stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Weza, some of the senior clients, in particular, have been offended by the unemployment pay system.
Some wine lovers may feel a shock from the digital world and prefer to be removed from the permanently known plastic envelopes, items that arouse memories of endless youth.
"I think that sometimes it can be a filling of waste or a possession of material things as a kind of relief," Wez says.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think many people have it.
It's a simple way to take care of your head.
"We're like their social workers," said a colleague from the plastic store.
The ICM survey in April showed that almost 50 per cent of the people who bought the wine album last month had not yet heard it.
The survey also found that 41 per cent had a gambler that they never used, while 7 per cent of those who bought the wine did not have a plate player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably have looked seriously inconvenient, promiscuous with Bosano's collectors.
The "Trofheine" aspect of the rebirth is what Johnny, 42 years old, has observed in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came up recently and said, "I don't have a plate player, but I want to buy a radiohead plate so we can put it to ourselves," he said.
It's not a big percentage, but it's definitely going to happen.
It's more of a piece, less of music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a plastic player."
They're younger, they're not older, they're a little less than twenty, they'll just know about it.
Fopp, who's now taking almost the entire wine floor, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples who in 70, tourists who take pictures, boys who are wealthy and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less unimpeded than in the above-mentioned shops — the latest Wild Beast synth and sex pop, not the jazz improvisation — it is pleasant to see the variety in its customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it's hard to establish a painful psychological trauma for 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleonora, 27 years old, went to Fop for a few minutes, considering the different plates available for sale.
She's looking at the goods, not the money.
It does not earn much, according to her words, so to collect the plates is not a very suitable option.
It's worth it.
Listening to music on a computer or another device is simple, but the beauty of the wine is ...", she's in a dream with a breath filled with love.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really unrepeatable.
My last stop is a shop, which, they say, has contributed to the emergence of a new generation of lovers: City models.
While I'm making an illusion that I'm looking at the gins-based shorts, I'm looking at a bunch of girls-in-laws, every minute of the Polaroid cameras, before the father and his daughter start discussing the buyer's purchase of Crosley.
On the left is a ladder with tiles of Adel, Jeff Buckley, Amy Waynehaus and Flitwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classics, binding tiles for any medium-sized collection.
No one sees — perhaps because they are mere decorations, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's the present "godly guilt."
However, given that any attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the Soho depth for a while, almost nothing to complain about.
It is not surprising that the stock of the population with more likely than most of the time and money than most of the population is the stock that spends most of the money on luxury items, such as guilt.
But as far as my conclusions show that the results of YouGov are accurate, at least in Soho plastic shops, they do not exclude the existence of a large number of women collectors and lovers of guilt that exist in reality, in plastic shops and online forums.
These people are probably working at school or in offices.
But they are obviously not on Thursday morning, walking through the stores of plastics on Bervik Street, embellishing plastics and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old false leader who writes on the shoulders of non-suspecting men of middle age.
Greenland Polar eagle — The Longest Calling Animal — Video Record
Scientists say that the Greenland polar shark has the largest life span of all bells on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, claims that the record has placed a male age from 272 to 512 and a length of five metres.
The French court rejects the offer to take the store to the refugee camp of Jungley
The French court rejected the offer of the Kale authorities to remove dozens of individual shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At the trial hearing this week, Kale authorities said that the State should be able to carry a total of 72 individual shops where people in the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to cut or sell 50 cents (40r) or simple meals for several euros in private restaurants.
Prefecture Kale said that these places should be reduced because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they are at risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vitally necessary, claiming that free custody offered by the pro-government association and other groups does not provide enough food for the growing number of camps.
They said that individual shops and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those in need.
The Court of Justice ruled that there was no legitimate reason to expel the people who managed 72 individual shops, but stated that Kale prefecture’s problems “were fully understood”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that bakalai, coffee, and restaurants played a much greater role than simply feeding people who "live under extreme conditions".
He said that space provided a peaceful meeting of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk was the children ' s coffee of the Jungle Book in the camp, which worked for no benefit and offered 200 meals a day, English and French sessions and asylum consultations for hundreds of vulnerable minors without escorts to the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect children’s coffee.
The letter sent to the Guardian stated that his closure would be "a disaster for these children, some of whom are not over eight years old".
Two charity agencies, Refugee Assistance and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of people in the Jungle camp increased and exceeded 9,000, the highest in all history, after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.

Britain stays on silver in Regbi-7 after Master-Class Fiji allows them to take gold
The impressive series of Great Britain in Regby-7 was decomposed at the final obstacle by the Fiji team at the final on Thursday evening, when they were completely destroyed 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has given a master class on the control of the ball, the scattering, the removal, support of the games, the running of the lines and the rough force to win the gold — their first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat was not too poor in the form of a silver - third in Britain - a day - and they were proud of their efforts in the first Regby-7 Olympic tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on their way.
The painful slaughter of Boxes, 7-5 in the semifinals earlier that same day, could be returned to negatively affect them in the finals.
But despite anything, Fiji won as much as a 15-person team.
This may be of some comfort to Britain — but probably not — that at least one British man will hang on a gold medal’s neck tomorrow: Chief Coach Fiji-Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
It was a journey for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
This is where they lost each other.
These strikes will cause pain, but progress is disastrous.
Fiji started a great deal of fun, refusing to try to take over the British ball.
It was like getting stuck in a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Collinsau dived into the corner.
The name of four minutes in the hours of Jerry Tuwa added another touchdown on the right flag that had been realized.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great attempt by Mitchell to capture a man on Mount Leon Nakarava from killing a third, but that only kept Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalou made a right-hand score, and Britain played 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resume and there were still more minutes... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravavo then broke through a few more severe attempts to take over Britain and stormed into line to get a point.
Implementation led to 29-0 interruptions.
It seemed as if Fiji was born for the game in Regbi-7, while Britain still holds the trade mark.
That's a lot like that.
The UK has done mass replacements for half-games, and they have bribed the Fijian lady... for every four minutes, that the first half standards were good until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton realized the attempt for Britain, made a tacdan in the left corner to make the account 36-7, but the game took a long time on the way to the South Sea islanders whose fans sang, fanned the flags and danced in the courts.
It was impossible not to admire Fiji’s approach with complete joy.
Mother William has decorated a Fijian cake that didn't need to be decorated, another attempt in the last few seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians were engaged, and Britain fell on the ground, completely defeated.
Earlier that same day, Fiji won Japan 20-5 in its semifinal, and Britain slightly surrounded South Africa in the tense semifinal of one attempt for each one, the different British implementation.
Kyle Brown will close the box in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great job, broke his leg and hit the tops in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt by Marcus Watson, a 15-year-old brother on the side of the English team, Anthony, to win — and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning were inspired to win a hard fight for cancer
It won't be any more exciting gold in these games, and that's what it says.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy acquisitions in history, Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning found additional significance of their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who had stretched the sails, there were three votes in this boat, coach Robin Williams was always there while they were striving for the second round of the Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the British sports anals who had reached such a height.
Their superiority was absolute, at the end of the day it was their 39th unconvincing, again unprecedented.
What we see is that two brilliant sportsmen rolling on the surface with the elegance of the bees do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
For every gold battalion, hands are ready to help gradually growing victories that are important, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, didn't know if he would live until he saw that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous thing.
I had a tumor cancer, which is one of what they can operate, and they did it.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
This could have been a pretty bad situation.
It's a little bit of a change in your future.
Williamsus diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky that he could start treatment early in 2014 in the interseason, keeping the schedule at a minimum, if this could be a correct expression in such circumstances as these.
I needed a paycheck, so I needed to make a quick fix.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and was dancing at the station — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they were talking about a few steps.
That's how it starts.
The handle itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
In the next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, the captain of the Artillerian police with his shoulder service in Afghanistan, said, "I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe it's a little cross, but that means so much."
It just confirms how much that means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin, too.
It was fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so thanks to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I could not ask for a better training partner or a better trainer.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning didn't lose any race in five years.
This couple has a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were very busy.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
Now it's very important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do something amazing.
We weren't waiting for the fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to be able to do well and go out and win this race that we did.
A couple will need a year to decide their future.
The floor must be at the wedding next month, on her own with Steve Backshawl's TV client.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
London took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government extended the period for the destruction of authorized products
The Government extended until the end of 2017 the period of destruction of food prohibited for imports to Russia.
The decision was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, which was published on the official legal portal.
The embargo was introduced in our country in August 2014.
The ban was subsequently extended several times, now in force until 31 December 2017.
Russia is prohibited from importing certain agricultural products, commodities and food from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, marine products, vegetables, fruit and milk products were banned.
The use of food imported into the country into the embargo is being carried out in Russia since August 2015.
Only for the I quarter of 2016, around 100 tonnes of prohibited products were removed from the sale.
The desire for a ban.
On Friday, rain and hail are expected in Moscow.
An atmospheric front will be passing through the steel region, which will bring precipitation and lower air temperature.
During the day, the air goes up to 25 degrees of heat.
Yes, a short-term rain, possible rains and windfalls will take place in Moscow on Saturday night.
The day is expected to rain with rains and wind breaks up to 12-17 m/s.
The rains are also forecast in the Orlova, Kursk, and Voronez areas, reports Dni.ru.
The next working week is unlikely.
The WTO panel found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the organization ' s rules.
Import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia at the time of accession to WTO.
"This is the first case when the WTO has taken a decision against the RF," says a communication on the official website of the organization.
However, the referees stressed in their conclusion that the EU did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia ' s measures were "systematic" or "absolute".
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt the import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is reflected in the communication from the Ministry of Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to appeal to the World Trade Organization for Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement by the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the conduct of the United States in dealing with WTO disputes undermines the principles of discussion.
Such a statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the Euro Union and other WTO members for refusing to approve the second term of the South Korean court of Chan Son Hwa.
In this regard, Russia will not address the WTO on Western sanctions imposed against the FP.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It is now made up of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The President's administration has changed the manager
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, appointed the head of his own administration, former Deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Wyno.
Vladimir Putin moved to the President ' s administration and hoped that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Wyno said at the meeting that he considered the important anti-corruption work that he had begun to take on the post of President Ivan's administration and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Previously, the Reports said that experts considered the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov as the head of the administration to be transparent and understandable, and that nothing would change in the work of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the manager who worked with the President's administration for a long time has effectively carried out the activities of the AP.
He was replaced by the Deputy Chief of Administration, Anton Wyno, a man who was well aware of the specific nature of the work.
In Poland, they allow them not to buy fuel from Gasprom.
The Polish State oil company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years' time, gas supplies from the RF may become attractive to it due to the re-orientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Polish Vice-President for the Finance of Boslav Mažez.
His word is passed by TAS.
"It may be that we will not buy gas at all (Gazprom), we will now diversify our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines for us will become the East, the raw materials from the GSP terminals and Norway," Mažez said.
Gasprom is currently taking the dominant position in gas supplies in Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that in the first half of 2016, the Russian supplier placed almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas at 30 per cent above the 2015 level.
The Russian gas giant's share of PGNIG's purchases increased to 49.8% compared to 40% earlier.
Recall that, on 22 July, the Polish Anti-Money Authority did not agree to the establishment of a joint venture "Gasproma" and its European partners for the construction of the "North Stream-2" gas pipeline.
During that month, Poland had left a request for Gasprom to supply 11 billion cubic metres of gas under the North Stream-2.
The Vice-President of the Dutch Government, Alexander Medvedev, said so.
The North Stream-2 auction will be held in 2017, and the auction will be scheduled on its website in autumn 2016.
At the end of May it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action in connection with the Polish party's intention to refuse long-term gas supply contracts from Russia after 2022, the Vice-President of the Management Board of Alexander Medvedev said.
He recalled that in the 1st quarter of the year, the Polish had only increased by 42 per cent of the RF's gas supply.
The Gazproma prison added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG itself made a statement to the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not yet mean that the negotiations are terminated.
The Polish company had previously appealed to the court to achieve a reduction in the purchase price for Russian gas.
The Polish Government ' s gas and energy infrastructure officer Petri Naimsky reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the gas supply contract.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expired in 2022.
In March, the authorized Government of Poland on gas and energy infrastructure, Petri Naimsky, stated that his country could be denied supply of blue fuel from the east six years later.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which connects the country with the Norwegian Shelf.
"North Stream-2" provides for the construction of two marine gas pipelines of a total capacity of 55 billion cubic metres per year from Russia to the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers around the Ukraine border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first SMS lock in Ukraine by Alexander Hughes.
"I can confirm that the SMS has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, responding to the relevant question of journalists, "RIA News".
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is peaceful, there are no security incidents.
Observers tracked the three crossing points across the Russian-Ukraine border.
There was a video on the ground at the airport of Ufu of the Jak-42 passenger plane, which was driven outside the flight-season area for 400 m and dropped on the left wing.
The video was released by the 360 TV channel.
The CPC took place at 4.30 a.m. in Moscow.
ChrisAvia's flight came from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place that was not affected.
Only the aircraft was transported to the station.
Oufa Airport is in normal operation.
The DRC's transport investigation was conducted by identifying the reason for the severe landing of the plane.
UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in the occupied areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict are denying the use of chlorine, but the UN special envoy for Syria, Stefan de Mistura, considers the fact that there has been no dispute.
Such statements were made before the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations, which should begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists began investigating reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on the use of toxic gas, supposedly chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
The opposition then stated that in an area where the Russian military-traffic helicopter had been hit recently, the air dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow these charges were called a void.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defence accused the opposition group "Harakat Nur ad-Din az-Zinky".
It soon became known that two bombs were started by toxic gas.
This was confirmed by the BBC as one of the victims.
"Just a few minutes later, I felt gas smell, started burning my eyes, it was hard to breathe," he quoted as saying to the audience.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of toxic gas is confirmed by experts, actions will be considered as a military crime.
UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters: "The evidence that this really happened is a lot."
The prohibition of the use of chlorine for military purposes is contained in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict denied the use of toxic gases, in 2015, human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of the use of chlorine by the Syrian army against “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo makes it difficult for the shootings of its areas to be carried out daily, while terrorists prevent the city from getting out of the city.
As Reuters reports, the United Nations expects Russia to put a "humanitarian pause" into military action.
The current system of daily three-hour rest in the organization is considered to be “adequate to help nearly 2 million peacekeepers who have been hunted”.
Advisor to Staffhan de Master of Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egelan said that a 48-hour cease-fire would be required to provide assistance and evacuation to the city of the sick and injured every week.
"We have to send heavy goods from a colonized truck to a place where the roads are practically destroyed and what remains is gone," said Mr. Egelan. "But the Russian delegation has confirmed the willingness to sit with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” continue.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
On 11 August, Russia announced a three-hour cease-fire regime for the Syrian city of Aleppo, which will operate daily from Thursday.
The creation of “humanitarian windows” is intended to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and items of the first need in the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defence was taken in the face of increased international pressure on Moscow, with the requirement to engage in the military operation and to facilitate the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result, four people were killed by a series of explosions in the Thai resorts.
There were a few explosions in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed, 19 injured.
The blaster came to the city of Hua-Hin.
Ten foreigners were among the victims, four citizens were not Russians.
The responsibility for the incident has not yet been taken up by any of the terrorist groups, but the IMF has hastened to declare that Islamists do not participate in it.
Several people have already been detained since the outbreaks were suspected.
According to preliminary local police data, the extent and specificity of the explosions indicate that they have been directed against the warheads of the country.
The attacks took place in popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the Phuketa area and the city of Hua-Hin, Trang and Surat-Tani.
After the arrival of the military junta in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few sectors that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people have visited the country, with 1.5 million more in 2015.
The first suspects were already detained in the preparation and organization of the attacks, reported by police Colonel Krisan Patanacharoen.
While speaking about the purpose, he added, but in the IMF, “it is believed that they are not related to international extremist groups”.
It was too early to make conclusions, Mr. Patanacharoen said.
But we certainly know that these incidents are not directly linked to any kind of terrorism, in fact it is a local diversity, and we are trying to identify the people behind them.
The explosions took place on the day of the birth of Queen Tailanda Sikrit.
The Thai hunta believes that the protection of the monarchy is one of its main priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to the statement by police general Citchichai Srisopacaroenrate, the bombs were bombed at a distance of half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on the alive streets filled with food in restaurants by tourists.
It is known that one of the four dead became a Thai girl who was selling street food.
The identity of the remaining victims is still unknown, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them four German citizens, three Dutch nationals, two Italians and Austrian citizens.
There are no Russians amongst the victims of the explosions, reports the Rosturism press.
Local experts also link the explosions to the last 7 August referendum, where 61.4% of the country ' s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by the Commission for the Development of a Constitution appointed by the military junta.
It was necessary to determine whether they supported the system in which the Supreme House of Parliament was fully appointed military and had a significant role in the election of the Prime Minister of the country.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time at the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Remember, on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the Commander of the Pruuta Chan-Och army.
At this point, he said, the army had been subjected to an ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military set up the National Council of Peace and Order, set up the Commandant Time and Censorship, set out protestors and the Parliament ' s upper chamber.
How Bangkok proved to be in an emergency
The Government of Thailand, with Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat, announced in January 2014 that the emergency situation in Bangkok and the capital of the provinces had been introduced.
The special regime extended for 60 days.
As in Bangkok, there were two explosions.
In January 2014, two explosions took place in the centre of Bangkok at the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, resulting in 28 people being injured, five of them being in a critical state.
The explosions were caused by unknown motorcycles.
The authorities have strengthened security measures in the capital and have attracted military forces to protect demonstrators.
In the dry log, conditions began to develop.
As “U” was known, the Government was invited to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the gold-plated location of Suhai Lodge with the maintenance of two key constraints.
The auction is proposed not to allow companies where 25 per cent or more belong to foreigners, and those claimants whose capital is not at least 25 per cent of the attendance.
The industry does not expect the Government to rewrite the conditions, noting that many players are not at risk of taking a complex and expensive project.
The auctions can be announced in August and held in October.
The Government has submitted to the Government a draft order and the terms of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold settlement in Russia, Suhai Lodge (Irkutsk area, stocks and resources of 130 million ounces), two sources of "U" known to the situation.
The project was introduced on Wednesday evening, which is one of them.
The project has been implemented in the Government by the United Nations in the form of a "U" in the form of a project in the form of a "U" in the form of a "U" in the form of a "G" in the form of "U" in the form of "U" in the form of "U" in the form of "U"
A representative of the curing vice-prime minister, Alexander Chloppinina, said "U", that the project had not yet been implemented in the office of the officer.
"The auction can be announced already in August, immediately after the Government's order has been issued, and, given the time limit for the collection of applications by potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender can take place already in October," they say in the city of Mindura.
According to "U", the project maintained two key requirements for potential participants in the option that was addressed to the ministries and FOIVA in July (it is at "U").
The first is the presence of at least 25% of the claimant's capital.
Second, the refusal to access the auction for foreign investors was based on FZ-57 understanding of investment in strategic societies.
According to the two FZ articles, as already written by "U" on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (25% and above) are not tax residents of the FF or have dual nationality may not be admitted to the auction.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, since Suhai Lodge is of federal importance (saves of more than 50 tons of gold).
The project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies”, but refused to comment on details before the Government.
The demand for participation in the bid was launched by the Irkutsk Region, spoke "U" in Minorida in December 2015 and later confirmed by the governor of the region Sergei Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the city of Minororida by his predecessor Sergei Eroshenko, "I had an investment agreement with Rosteh".
Those who lobbyed the restrictions on the admission of foreigners do not specify the "U" interviewees.
"But it's in the spirit of time: not to give control to the largest gold settlement in Russia in the face of Western sanctions," argues the interviewer "U" known for preparing the auction.
The head of the Municipality of Sergei Donski said on 1 August that foreigners "can go to a consortium" if the applicants attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners".
Consects of the "U" consider it unlikely that conditions will be adjusted in the Government.
The main candidate in Suhai Lodge in the industry is the consortium of the largest producer of the RF PAO "Polish", Suleiman Kerimov Saydu, and Rosteh.
According to U, in July, the partners created S.P.L. Gold, where 51% share in the "Polish" structure of Rosteh RT-GR - 49%.
In Rostohehe, the comments were rejected, in Poland they declared "U", that "no doubt interested in this asset" and had all the necessary skills and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be taken after the announcement of the conditions," they added to "Polish".
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision of the RF Government has been called "U".
A Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, developing assets in Čukotke, said that they could participate in the development of the Sukho Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to the U, were not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of Gold Industrialists RF Sergei Kashuba assessed U investment in Suhai Lodge in December 2015 in $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential claimants are not only afraid of investment, but also of the complexity of the project: there is a need for a serious awareness of the stockpiles and technology of complex mines, explains the "U" interviewers in the industry.
In the pension market, M&A launched the biggest deal - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" launched the merger process of four sub-control NPFs.
As a result, NPF will be established on the basis of Gazfund Pension Stocks, with a stock of approximately 373 billion rubles.
On the start of the merger procedure of the four pension funds - KIT Finance, Pragrofond, Inheritance and Gazfond Pension Stocks - yesterday, the owner of the KIT Finance Pension Administrator reported.
“Reorganization is carried out in accordance with the CB’s compliance with the requirements for non-decreasing the terms of the existing treaties,” the company reported.
The association is conducted on the basis of the Gazfund Pension Stocks.
As NPF Director Oleg Bálošicki notes, the pooling of funds has several challenges: increasing the geographical presence, concentration of resources for development, reducing costs, tracing the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the indicative deadline for completion of consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of NPF Gazfund Pension Stocks, it will become the largest player in the OPC market.
According to the data of 31 March, the amount of pensions of the pooled funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As reported on the fund website, the beneficiaries of their owner - the KIT Finance Pension Administrator - are currently Anatolio Gavrilenko (under the control of 65% of Gazfund) and NPF (35%).
However, the only group that joined had started much later on.
Yes, the O1 NPF Sub-Control Unit "The Future " swallowed Stalfund" early this year.
Currently, this combined NPF joins the Uralsib and the Russian Standard funds.
"Joining into a single structure, apart from reducing costs, is necessary to address structural challenges," notes NPF Director-General Nikolai Sidorov.
The active work on fund consolidation since April is also being carried out by the Safmar pension group - NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Regional Fund" - should be involved in the NPF "Safmar" by the end of the current year.
In 2017, the Dvoría NPF will join them.
"The pooling of funds will have an effect on increased control of risks, operating processes and costs", noted in the Safmar pension group.
The delay in the pooling of funds supported by the “CIT Finance Manager”, may be caused by several reasons, the experts state.
Until recently, NPF could not buy more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure bonds in which the group was active.
Following amendments to the CB decision in March of this year, there are no longer any restrictions on a number of issuers that meet the regulatory requirements.
If necessary, all issues can be purchased by one major game," says the Director of the Akra Financial Institutions Rating Group, Yury Nogin.
Several top-15 NPF managers for another possible reason call a split of influence and, as a result, staff appointments in a single fund that had to be agreed by group owners.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for comments.
At the request of "U" in NPF "Gazfund" they also didn't respond.
While the consolidation of funds is a workable and non-profit event, the decision will be justified in a long time.
As Dr. Sergei Okolesnov, Director of the Consulting Company " Pension Partner " , the "Gazfonda Pension Collections" is less inflows, accession will allow the stabilization of the base of other group funds.
In this way, more successful experience will be gained from the KIT Finance and Progro-Fondon NPFs in the construction of various ODA sales, as well as the use of more modern ODPs.
The requirements of CBs for processes and NPF staff are growing, and therefore, to double the infrastructure in four funds with a single investment policy, the Managing Director for Corporate Ratings "Expert RA" Paul Mitrofanov.
"Effects from the reduction of duplication clearly exceed the possible costs of merger," notes Mr. Mitrofanov.
The cost of the merger of the four funds is estimated by Sergei Okolesnov at 30 to 50 million rubles.
"The cost of the four funds of such sizes is about 400 million rubs a year, with the medium-term consolidation of the budget actually reducing twice," Mr. Okolesnow said.
The best design film "Pit and his dragon" appeared in the Russian screen.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the charming dragon, the life story, and the country-style song enough to re-trust old-fashioned magic, is considered by ELENA CRAWCUN.
The frightened little girl improved the dragon, becoming a human child and a gentle nurse, and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, honors a box of stories, plays with him in the driveway and sleeps in the picture.
Six years later, when he grew up and was in a good relationship, he could no longer distinguish himself from another imaginary forest climber, Maugli.
In this way, Pete finds the rustic wife of Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while Brigade Gavin (Karl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively rocked by the forest.
Now she'll have to believe not only in the existence of a dragon, but also help save him.
Pete is taking an accelerated course "to be a man" in the neighborhood of the idyllic Americans who are wearing cowboys, the moral code in their hearts, and smiling more blindly than in any advertisement.
None of the characters look or act too terrible that the viewer is currently starting to hate or fear it.
Even Gavin, who set out to hunt the untypical inhabitants of his superior forest, was far away from the uncorrected crime.
A huge, dry dragon was also found to be quite fearless, with a good muddy bulldog, a flying wing, and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is fun, mulling, even squeaking, and fortunately does not say, because he always wants to starve, it is beneficial to all known cinematographic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of holding hold ensures such a high level of emotional involvement that at the most tense moments, the three arms are desperate not only for small audiences but also for adults.
Amazingly good and young Oaks Figley in the role of Pete, who breaks up between a possible family and the present.
And Robert Redford is giving up a cannon grandfather who would love to have a baby.
How did director David Louri remove a fantasticly nice frame of the forgotten "Dracone Pitt" movie in 1977, mediated from the nose to the end of the tail and remembered only by the mix of animation and the play movie, and make it his own soul movie this summer?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
In his painting, Laurie from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There were music numbers and most of the strange jokes on board.
This good story reads the drawings from the "Bambi", "Inplanetian" and many other kind hearts of children.
Disney's study continues to expand the gallery of high-quality frames in the 21st century.
Of course, "Pit and Dragon" is not as charming as "The Book of Jungle", and it has no experience of the evil that Kate Blancett has seen in the role of a cat in the new "Wolve".
However, this naive film is no less successful in helping to believe in miracles and good in better dysneic traditions.
In fact, the keys to the magic lock The Disney director Louri will get another one for the artistic adaptation of the story of Peter Pene.
The "Pita and his dragon" tandem David Louri and the screenwriter Toby Helbrooks entered a new ambitious project on a non-growth boy by James Barry alone.
Journalist RBK Alexander Sokolov has filed a new indictment
Journalist RBK Aleksandra Sokolova, accused of organizing the extremist structure, stated that the prosecutor had found minors in their custody.
The fact that the prosecutor's office has made such a presentation, we found out from the investigators literally yesterday.
We had been scheduled to attend a judicial meeting on the subject of limiting the information on criminal matters, but there was no meeting, and the investigators informed us of the submission made by the prosecutor," said lawyer Olga Dinze.
She said that the prosecutor had indicated to the investigators that the qualifications of the case and the collected material were inadequate.
The investigators will now have to remove the gaps in the evidence base and present Alexander Sokolov with a new indictment.
Either the other article of the Criminal Code (AC) will appear, or will remain the same, but with other evidence and new evidence, Ms. Dinze will clarify.
As told by "U", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the accusation of the RBK journalist ' s wording of "degradation of the political situation towards instability" and "infringement of authority by illegal means".
Aleksandr ZILBERT, the correspondent of the Kommersanthoboscosport, lived the Olympics in the Olympic Village, inspected the Russian assembly house, ate at the local table, and even passed the WADA test.
Looks like life doesn't die here for a second.
Even at night.
The last beginnings are sometimes completed at midnight, after which the athletes need another half-hour to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, there is no stop-and-go out of the village because some athletes finish their talks and leave Brazil, and some, on the other hand, only arrive here.
At 7:30 a.m., the heads of all the Olympic delegations are wearing one of the temporary curtains.
In these meetings we usually discuss some operational domestic issues, as the head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team, Igor Kazikov, tells us. - Despite the fact that the house in which we were located, you think, modeled it into the operation of one of the first and demonstrated to all the examiners, even in it, that there are some misunderstandings.
It's a hot water problem, so I'm sorry, it's a unitasm.
We fought for purity for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the clinics came, but they only rub some substance in the field, yes and everything.
They have fields, do you see some innovations?
Mol, you can't wash them humanly.
We know these fields are ordinary.
In general, there have been changes in the clanging company and now everything OK.
The Olympic village is such a South Boutovo, a sleeping area that is surrounded by mountains on one side, by an impressive curve, by salty waters on the other.
There's still a two-metre track for reliability, along which the automatics are walking.
The whole village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings, a huge Russian flag hangs - this house is completely dedicated to our collection.
With the view of a small lobby at the entrance, it is possible to determine at once what problems appear to be most pressing for the national team.
Two announcements are pending: "Please, don't throw a paper in the toilet!" and at the hand of "Primo in gift badges.
The stasis itself sinks into the brigades.
Their cheerful blossom contrasts with the headlines of the brochure: "The remembrance of infectious diseases for those going to Rio de Janeiro", "The first aid in warming, the fall of the international body in respiratory pathways, the loss of consciousness - the stages of cardiovascular renaissance", "The first aid in fires, the heat strike, the fractures and the bleedings".
Text inside is generally encouraging.
For example, "Infection is accompanied by disease and subsequent treatment.
However, not all are waiting for a positive outcome.
Of course, the Russian assembly has a medical centre, which at any time is ready to provide home-qualified assistance, including relaxing and sporting massages.
On the contrary, the centre is the headquarters of our delegation.
It's like, "No matter what we win, we're gonna win."
And, of course, verses:
All the arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear (Allah) will believe in it.
Let us, the sweet taste of victory, Russia not retreat, not break!
And for the more exalted of the soul is the proclamation: “Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and the whole of Russia, Kirilla is carrying out the spiritual care of sportsmen of the Russian Olympic assembly by the protoires of Andrey Vladimirovich Alekseyev.
You can order a petition and other requests on the phone...
In fact, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious Work for representatives of all denominations in the village.
Well, the Russians, in a privileged situation, have their own watch.
Because of the charge of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to land on the ladder recommended to be used during the fire.
And in the dark there was a glimpse of the bodies lying on her.
They were, on the whole, sleeping associates of a new clanging company.
I believe that at any time they were willing to go to the hall of innovative sex, they decided to set up a quiet time directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was awaiting a meeting with a former known Vitalie Fedorovice Dubko, a coach of our Batutistas who brought them to the Olympic Gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his teacher, the European champion Jan Paulov, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
We're living in two, sleeping, of course, almost in a hurry, but it's not critical.
Sanselle's one on the fourth, but that's why it's spacious.
The scarf, of course, funny, out of fabric, trust doesn't cause, but there's something you can put.
"No, you're bluffing, they're done with tea!" -- she's divorced by a tennis player named Lustlan Kuznezov, who met me at the main table.
It is called the main site, at least because it represents the area of 2.7 thousand sq m and is ready to accept at the same time 5,000 visitors.
There's six thousand shares in the day for free.
The options are: "Boys from Brazil", "Cooks of Peace", "Asian Guards" and "Pipe, Macaronics".
The last option I've seen is the popularity of our volleyballists.
And let's say I didn't find any soup in any of the giant restaurants.
What kind of soup?
I'm glad I caught Chinese with me, you fool.
And a cup of tea.
But, you know, we've got a lot worse food in the shorts.
There's something you can choose here, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I've personally chosen a pair of pair of fricadels in a tomato sauce.
A table with its name in three languages is available in English, French and Portuguese, as well as in terms of the food value of the product and the availability of allergens.
Well, to admit it was exactly the same.
I don't even know why it's always in the local McDonald's.
The so-called "hot" sportsmen on the way out of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends, representatives of the World Anti-Fraud Agency (WADA).
They're cheating on the hunter-victor, the winner of the football game.
They're provocative, you can say!
In order to receive a gift, it is necessary to answer at least eight out of ten questions.
There are questions in Russian! - I was attacked by a girl from WADA.
But it didn't attack.
I mean, I got stuck in a patriotic break, of course.
The situation has already become acute on the second question: "If I have received a notification of doping control, should I immediately go to doping control?"
I said, "I don't have one hour."
He's lost, so to speak, vigilance.
I forgot that WADA did not have to wait for it.
In general, we need to be right away.
Well, at the seventh stage, my situation became quite critical.
I was wondering why if I would find it difficult to follow a balanced diet due to my flat schedule (and I think it's hard!) I could use bioadditions to get "additional nutrients to improve my productivity".
No, no, no, no!
More precisely, the answer is that categorically they do not prohibit, but strongly, they respond in a number of proposals.
It's an unfair WADA!
So, how's it going, Russia?
To retreat somewhere behind Efimova, Isinbaeva and all of our unarmed team.
That's why I've focused, and I've won an unfortunate football game from the last one.
Know what they say, ours!
In a winning mood, I went to the gym next door.
It's a coach's account.
He hit 250.
It was surprising that no Russian sportsman was found in this event.
But maybe it's right?
Let the one who can't play be trained!
And there's one of our guys sitting in a nearby polyclinic.
In turn to the eyelid.
Don't worry, don't shoot.
In the polyclinic, however, as well as in the whole village, it hangs a condom - delivery machine.
And there is a cry in it, “Fill with the camel.”
There remains only to be a rolling iron that reminds the door handle, and the condoms made from the Amazon's natural latex come out of the machine.
I took one, remember.
They won't get away from the sportsmen, they've taken them 450 thousand.
There is a whole entertainment centre in the Olympia village as a occasion for a holiday and a holiday.
In any case, it is worth knowing that the International Olympic Committee will spend $3.25 million a day on sportsmen.
The center features video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some strange devices like video trainers.
What is it? - I'm interested in a company in the form of a Ukrainian gathering that actively uses a wild game.
I could, of course, just say that he doesn't want to talk to a man in the form of a Russian assembly, yes and everything.
Here, in some strange setting, the eyes are catching from the boys in yellow and blue.
It's the most playful collection in the world.
It takes not less than three hours to walk around the village, looking at every corner of it.
But if it's just that you're going, not to go to the electricians, you're open to a house with a Canadian forest with a entrance and a closet with a refurbished bathroom, and a ticket office, and a laundry, and a gym, and a park store, and a flower shop, and a box with daily consumer goods, and a box with unique brands (you can't still transfer from the Chinese affiliates), and the bank, and the office, and the fototoiosk.
Later in the evening, you will sit next to the olive tree, lined with various colored strips in memory of those who have left the world, friends and relatives of the athletes.
And you're going to be under the combination of a machine that's unscrupulous liquid to kill insects, to think of eternity.
It's about the Olympic movement.
Which doesn't stop in this village for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world remained silent, it was observed that the Australians did not hear the American Dream Team, these patients went online.
Little one knows: the news that Inn Deriglasza won the gold in rapier at the XXXI Olympics, I got the first one.
Maybe I'm the only muscle I've ever seen, as it happened, not to those who were looking at the Carioca competition that night.
This can only be understood by the current patient.
Here's the sound of Moscow's night.
The neighbors down - as they always do until nighttime - fall asleep and begin to scream at each other, but it's very loud.
And it's threatening to move furniture.
There's no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
The TV schedule did not make any sense, so it just kept track of the Match, the First, and in any case, Russia -- although it's almost meaningless.
Russia is a family of repeats, all sports there for a reason in the records.
There's serials in the direct air.
Hope, of course, for "Match" - all night a young man shouted in news first about the great semifinal of Deriglas-Shanaev, then about the fighting for gold.
It would make sense to show.
But instead of basketball, it's U.S. Australia.
I don't think I can say anything bad about that.
The Australians were equal, the first half won at all.
They put in place officers of their own size Americans.
As a result, they have lost, but, as they say now, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be an ancient one.
It's all good, but it's getting close to Di Francisco, and on the screen without change.
I'm panicking, and I'm starting to write down channels.
That's the feeling, the second time in a row.
All right, let's go deep, on the cables.
There's no "Matthew" on any of the subjects.
And, in my opinion, the battle will begin.
I don't like the texting and television broadcasts of some sports sites.
The truck serfing produces an unexpected, but brilliant result.
On the First page, there is a direct technical transmission of all the competitions that are taking place at this time.
I'm clicking on a fett, I'm getting a gold unit.
Derigles are very contratracting, moving forward in the face - and it's obviously starting to take time.
The Italian is playing almost all the breaks.
Our point forward, to the end, is over two seconds.
The Frenchman is throwing himself on the Dérigals, and he's retreating, and the time is running out, the Italians are going around.
Victory!
In a few seconds, an Olympic messenger on the phone reported the fourth gold medal.
It's coming out, I'm the first to see it with my eyes.
The fools, the faithful, the sinners.
Tatarstan is denied the use of the Russian language in the mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM was forced by its imams to preach Friday only in tatar to force young tatars to “seek their native language”.
In the administration it is stated that it is "no harm in any case" to the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazani remembers that the Tatar language does not understand up to 60 per cent of the people, including foreign students, migrants and tatars themselves.
Imams are afraid that their sermons in Tatar will “not reach the entire audience.”
Yesterday, the Tatarstan DUM plenary unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the republics only in the Tatar language.
As Tatarstan Mufti Kamil Samigulin said, it must be an incentive for young tattoos to “learn their native language”.
"For those who say that "weight" in every large mosque, we intend to organize the Tatar language lessons absolutely free of charge," said Mr. Samigulin.
He added that “the decision has already entered into force” and today in all mosques “must be in Tatar language”.
He recalled that the Tatarstan DUM is publishing the Shora magazine with typical Tatar sermons.
I've got something that doesn't speak well enough to say, "It can be prepared in a basic way."
DUM Tatarstan brings together more than a thousand revenues in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to Muftia, Friday’s sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, the Russian language was mostly used in several mosques in Kazana.
In particular, as the Mufti pointed out, it was practiced in the Burnaev Muskete, Zakaban and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhamethzin stressed that the leadership tasked all students with both national and national languages.
"No harm can be done to a Muslim netizen," said Mr. Muhamethin, explaining that the preaching itself is “not a binding, fundamental part of the emmass."
In this way, the text will continue to be read in Arabic, and lessons and lessons in Russian will be preserved in the mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Muhamethin said, "U", that there was no serious threat of extermination of the Tatar language from the mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, it is reported that the Republic is not used in its sermons.
The DUM decision was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WCT).
The head of the U.K.P.O. Rinat Zakirov said, "U" "Mechety is an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language had gone out of this area.
He noted that preaching in the Tatar language was “the desire of the Imams themselves”, but in the WCT, they “considered it to be right”.
The requested "U" have been preaching in Russian, ready to comply with the DUM decision, but they believe that there will be difficulties in understanding the clergy.
There's tatars in the castle and Russians.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course they'll be sad.
"I have to go back," says I've got the Burnaev Mosque Farhat Mawletdinov.
According to him, the preaching in Russian is closer to even many tatars, since “Russian in schools and in children, on the radio is original.”
However, he believed that the muscles would be able to continue lessons and lessons in the Russian language that were held in other days.
We put our trust in Allah.
"Allah will show you the way out of this."
But about 60% of us don't know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbek and Tajik and Azerbaijani.
We have a lot of foreign students: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been in Russian for four years," I said.
He believes that the Tatar sermons will “come to a more narrow circle and do not come to the entire audience”.
But we will be subject to the decision of the fleet.
The outcome of the preaching work will be different.
But time will show.
"I, for example, will only be easier, because the Tatar language is my native language," Gabdulla Gallillin concluded.
Former Director of the FSIIN
The Moscow Prosecutor ' s Office has passed an indictment on the case of the investigating CSU of a criminal offence involving the acquisition of budgets for the purposes of the Russian FSI.
A former head of the prison department, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy, who caused more than 2.7 billion rubles to be damaged, will be brought before the court.
The Civil Prosecutor's Office sent a criminal case to the Zamovskor Court with respect to the former Director of FSIIN of Russia Alexander Reimer, his former Deputy Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the Director of FGI “The Centre for Information Technology and Communications of the Federal Service for the Enforcement of Penalties” (FGIP CITOS) by Victor Overenova.
Depending on the role and extent of participation in the crimes, they are accused of the CPCSC on Moscow at 3 p.m. 285 CSFs (use of authority with serious consequences), c. 4 CSFs 159 CSFs (manufacture by the use of their position as an organized group, particularly large).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under article 222 of the RF (unlawful acquisition and storage of munitions).
According to the CDR version, in 2010-2012, the persons identified by fraud seized from the public penalty the budgets allocated to the FSIIN to provide the branch with electronic monitoring systems for the subcontrollers, so-called electronic brochures.
For the loss of budgetary money, the group developed a scheme under which the CITOS GSP under control, with which the relevant public contracts were concluded, produced control and oversight techniques, including electronic brochures, and implemented several times at prices.
Although CITOS FGUP had no production equipment, buildings, equipment for the placement of production capabilities to create a final cycle of the production of electronic brochures, between them and the FSIIN Russia were locked up by more than 3.3 billion rubles.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubbs were stolen from the Samar branch of the GHF, of which 1.2 billion rubbs were stolen.
According to the investigation, over 140 million of the funds recovered were personally received by Mr. Reimer in his office by one of the participants in the criminal case for which a separate production was committed.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who participated in the machinations, found an unknown origin of the patron to the awarding gun, which allowed him to file an additional indictment.
In the present case, the amount of 133 volumes, FSIIN claimed to the accused the reimbursement of material damage of 2.7 billion rubles.
Soccer Hakan Shukure is suspected of taking a trip.
The Turkish authorities issued an order for the arrest of the former footballer and then a member of the Hakan Sukura parliament and conducted a search in two homes of his family.
The Turkish football star in the 1990s, which was the beginning of the 2000s, is being searched by the country ' s authorities for a coup in the past month.
Forvard, who completed his sports career in 2008, was accused of being an "armed terrorist group".
The Hizmet movement is a society associated with a well-known Turkish religious actor and opposition to Fetholha Gulen.
It was his President Erdogan who was the organizer of the military coup on 15 July.
Fethollah Gulen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities require his extradition.
According to local media, a warrant was issued today for the arrest of Hakan Shukura, and the police have already conducted searches in two homes belonging to the family of the former footballer.
According to the investigation, his father was also involved in the Fethollah Guilen organization other than Hakan Shukure himself.
However, neither the former footballer nor his close friends were there.
He and his family are now living in the United States.
In the home of a footballer, Hakan Sukur protected the colors of several Turkish clubs and served as a gathering country.
He spent most of his career in Galatasara.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as English "Blackburn".
True, he did not spend more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukuur has so far remained the most effective attacker of the Turkish assembly: in its assets 112 fighters for the national team and 51 swords killed.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his post due to the initial corruption investigation of the Erdogan party and its immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish Hurriyet newspaper, an order was issued in Turkey on 25 July to arrest at least 42 journalists.
They are accused of supporting the military coup and the connection with the opposition Islamic preacher Fetholha Gulen, who lives in the United States.
In view of the gravity of the charges, the media staff can expect long prison terms from ten years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovski wants to create a film network only for family movies.
"I would create a cinema network exclusively for a Russian cinema, which was in 2-3 times less than for films of foreign production," he said.
Mr. Conchalovski noted that the Russian films were difficult to compete for the audience with the big Hollywood tapes.
We have more than 100 images per year in our country, of which there are an average of 20-25 tapes.
"And they even find it very difficult to compete with "Transformers" and "The Iron Man", in which huge budgets are being promoted," the film director said.
It is recalled that on 1 July, the Universal Youth Education Forum "Tavrida" began work in Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals from various creative and humanitarian areas across Russia and a number of neighbouring and distant countries.

U-Novosta - The New Genocide promises to surrender Zenit Arena by 26 December.
A new champion of St. Petersburg stadium, which is to be won by the Cup of confederations in 2017 and the World Cup in 2018, the Metrostre company promises to surrender the arena by 26 December, reports "RIA News" with reference to the head of the Federation's Interim Commission for the Preparation of the World Cup in 2018, Wadima Tulipanov.
"Today we have visited the building with Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko, with us as Director of Metrostray Wadim Alexander.
He said he would deliver the stadium by 26 December.
It's a serious peterburg company, it never violates the deadlines.
Vitalia Mutko and I have remained quite visible and heard," quoted the interviewer's agency.
In the past, Vitaly Mutko arrived in St. Petersburg to check out the venues for major events.
Mr. Tulpanov also noted that the Sovfeda commission would continue to monitor the construction of the stadium and would visit the building regularly.
Last night, it became known that Metroster would complete the construction of Zenit Arena, the value of the contract would amount to about 5.4 billion rubb. The same company won the auctions for the well-being of the stadium, the value of the contract would be 2.4 billion rubb. Contracts with the "Transster" Corporation", the "Transster" Engineering Corporation" and the "Transster Engineering Corporation" were dissolved.
Two companies had not yet been allowed to fight for the construction of the stadium.

In Miasse (Chelabean Region), former Deputy Governor Nikolay Sandakow Konstantin Akulik was detained.
As “U-South Ural” reported to another accused lawyer, Sergei Kolosovski, Konstantin Akulic today called on the investigation department of the MIASA to file an annual case of killings.
Then Constantine Akulik went to the DTP station as a lawyer to assist one of his participants.
"It was originally initiated with regard to unestablished persons. Now that he began protecting Nikolai Sandakow, it turned out to be Akulic," says Sergei Kolosovski.
Constantine Akulic became a former deputy attorney of the Governor in early August.
In the meantime, half an hour before a lawyer called for protection in the MIAS, the party was informed that Monday was due to be informed of the fraud cases in which Nikolai Sandakova was accused.
It is recalled that two criminal cases have been committed against Nikolai Sandakow.
As part of his first (false act), he was incriminated by a promise of 1.5 million rubles to assist in the appointment of Mayor Magnitogorsk Head of the Administration of Lake Evgenia Tarasov.
The second criminal case relates to the acquisition that Nikolai Sandakov had allegedly received from the director of the Piton Cup in the form of an illegal free provision of property services of at least 1.3 million rubs.
Read more about Mr. Sandakov's case in the "U" material "Exterior Deputy Governor requires the merger of his cases".
The Russian honey company (RMC) is ready to take on social responsibility and to give more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMK has taken up the modernization of one of the country's oldest and most environmentally "grey " enterprises, the Caribbean mede-flight combination.
The Karabash Mede fleet was founded by an English stock company in the head of Lesley Urkvart in 1910.
In the Council's time, it was important for the economy of the industrial industry, and it actually ensured the viability of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, production was stopped because of financial problems, resulting in serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, a decision was made to resume the work of the Karabash Medal.
It was also necessary to address one of the major environmental problems of the Karabash plant.
By the early 2000s, Karabash had already been known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company was run by the Russian dairy company.
The company began to modernize production, which gradually reduced the environmental burden on the environment.
This has been noted recently by the Governor of the Chelabean Region, Boris Dubrovski, who visited the first issue of July, Karabashmedi.
The head of the South Ural called the major changes that have taken place with the company since Karabashmedi went to the RMK group.
The main event on the modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sero-stolic tube to capture up to 99.9 per cent of the metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Honey Company, the amount of investment in the project amounted to some 7 billion rubles.
The next phase of the modernization of the CARABASMEDY ZAO is the reconstruction of the convertible.
The replacement of three converters, vacuum cleaners and gas tractors was planned at the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubs.
In addition, at the end of 2016, a new clean-up of industrial goods is planned to be worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, taxes on the city of Karabash will also increase.
The federal penalty will be 8.9 billion rubs for the entire duration of the Tominian GOC project - from the start of construction and until the second stage of operation.
Following the introduction of the GOC, the total budget revenue of all levels may be 80.9 billion rubles.
For the year of production in the Varennes region, a budget of 346.3 million rubles is listed.
And that's the first year.
"As long as the company works well, the amount of the payments may be higher," Valerie Ulanovski added.
In the RMC, it was clarified that in 2015 the tax calculations from the Mikeev GOC were close to 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of CRM enterprises in the life and development of their territory is not limited to tax deductions.
The RMC is helping to repair and maintain schools, children ' s gardens, sports facilities, cultural and recreational facilities, and to enrich the territory.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian dairy company in Karabash has become capital repairs, and in fact, the almost complete conversion of the N9 child gift to 95 students.
The building, built in 1960, was in an emergency condition.
Also in the territory of RMC Arena, a landscape park with artificial dust, underground and underground parking for 600 machines, coffee and sports shops will be located.
RMC Arena will be able to carry out outstanding professional sports activities at the international level.
But the main objective of the project is to make physics and sport accessible to the people of Chelabinska, especially to children.

The Sandholm refugee centre in Denmark has suspected that the adolescent population is engaged in prostitution.
That's what The Local reports on Thursday, August 11.
According to him, some teenagers told staff in the institution that “some people in Copenhagen are organizing prostitution”.
According to the publication, the suspicions of reception workers arose after Swedish newspaper Sydsvenkan told similar stories in Malme.
In 2015, the crisis in the European Union arose due to the influx of refugees from Africa and the Middle East.

WSJ: The United States is considering the imposition of sanctions against the RF because of the collapse of democratic servers.
U.S. officials are considering introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the collapse of the Democratic Party's servers, writes The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
It is reported that, for sanctions to be imposed, the US President Barack Obama will have to be formally charged with attacks on Russian servers or supported by the Russian hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other American services are virtually confident of Russia ' s participation in cybercrime.
WSJ notes that the United States usually prefers not to mention hackers.
The exception is the entry in 2014 of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, which was officially assigned to the CSD.
However, last year Obama issued an order facilitating the imposition of sanctions on those who implement or promote cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be lengthy, the publication writes.
Even if officials found that hackers had been operating with Russian support, they would have had to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose information.
They have to determine whether it is so serious to increase the tension in bilateral relations.
Earlier, it was reported that the Barack Obama administration allowed sanctions against the State that hackers had broken down from the Democratic Party's Nazi party.
WikiLeaks has published an electronic copy of the National Democratic Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved.
In Kremlin, such messages were called absurd.
FAS hit Google almost half a billion rubles
There has been a distortion of competition in the mobile applications market.
The anti-monopolate procedure was initiated at the Indices initiative.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the prevention of applications from other developers, in particular from "Andex".

However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the department have been in judicial proceedings.
In FAS, it was noted that despite the fine, they discussed with Google the possibility of concluding a world agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
Such an opinion was expressed by Ehu Moscow by the leading researcher Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazine also noted that the fine would not affect the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

Anime effect Snapchat criticises as a caricature of Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by an anime, but some viewers say it is racially ill-fated.
With the help of the Snapchat tool, about 150 million users per day can change the reality and play with individuality in ways that limit absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a person to support the painting of Roy Liechtenstein.
The lines are rough, distorting lines of instruments that create more than 30 million adjusted self - control per day.
Any mistakes are quickly made public.
Snapchat's lines were criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising black-haired persons or encouraged selected persons as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users this week were offered a lens that gave them hairy eyes, curved teeth, and soft teeth, some critics thought it a racist cartoon on Asians, yellows.
And they wondered whether these repeated contradictions to the more serious problem of a company related to diversity were identified.
On Wednesday, reports on The Verge and Motherboard were reported and followed by a breakdown in reports on the next day after Snapchat stated that they had removed this function.
The company commented: Linza was designed as an honor to an anime, not as an Asian cartoon.
But experts who know that racism is not hearing, Linza reminded us of abusive stereotypes in effect.
Others totally rejected a comparison with anime.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American artist whose photo tweets were actively shared, said that the lens was "suffering and at least unbearable".
She added that "it was difficult to argue with a side-by-side comparison of very rough cartoons on Asians and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellowing, but to a maximum extent destructive yellowing.
Snapchat is not the only company that walks through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, starting from corporate meeting halls to Hollywood and the girls we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapchat, who are more racially diverse than their older generation, can mean that they are more likely to be understood.
When a Snapchat lens creates an image that is offensive to the user, in an interview with 25-year-old Katy Jou on Thursday, "it's much more difficult to stay undetected than it was before."
On Thursday, Ju, the product manager and the engineer who is working on the Medium, decided to remove his recording in Snapchat and urged others to do the same.
In the article for the Medium and in the telephone interview, she said that racial contradictions were due to insufficient diversity in the recruitment of Snepchat.
Ju criticized the most prominent white management of the company, consisting only of men and ended up with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Ju, who is the American of Chinese origin, wrote: “They do not have enough black people in the state to make such decisions, or they do work, but they do not hold positions that can be safely and openly spoken to.”
Other viewers share her point of view by expressing discontent that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, stressing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but according to a trusted person, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on the poorly represented populations and on active attempts to engage in domestic resources.
For his part, Ju said that she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say that they won't. "
The military leadership has violated IGIL intelligence, reports the commission of the Congress
Officials from the U.S. Central Military Command have amended intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, rather than on the ground of events on the ground, the commission of Congress reported on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group, established by the Presidents of the Committee of the Chambers of the Office of the Representatives of the Office of the Office of the Secretary-General, the Committee on Intelligence and the Subcommittee on Military Provisions, found “wide-ranging dissatisfaction” among the analysts of the Central Command Intelligence Service, which claimed that the leaders had undermined their assessments of American actions aimed at victory over the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military management in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The research documents confirmed by Centcom’s Supreme Command generally gave a more optimistic picture of U.S. counter-terrorism action than actual data from the scene, and were more optimistic than the analysis provided by other special services,” said the report.
"What has happened in Centcoma is unacceptable: when the senior management appears to be uncertain, our military suffers," said a member of the House of Representatives Ken Calvert, a Republican of California.
The problems with leadership in Centcoma are at the top of the organization.
The ten-page report explains in detail the ongoing shortcomings in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at the training of the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain conclusive evidence that the members of Obama's management ordered the falsification of the reports, he claims that analysts felt that Centcoma's leadership forced them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as IGIL or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony of the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than actual events”, the report reported.
For example, Centcoma official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remained under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is probably known," said a member of the House of Representatives Mike Pompey, a Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the U.S. Central Command's highest intelligence management has been subscribing command intelligence papers to reduce the threat from IGIL to Iraq.
The Republicans set up an operational group when they learned that the analysts expressed concern that the intelligence of the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation is under way, the report published on Thursday will be followed by more extensive data.
An additional unresolved investigation by Centcoma has been conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
The representatives of the Democratic Party in the Committee on the Intelligence of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress published their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican operational group.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centco has established an excessive closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments regarding IGIL and Iraqi security forces," claims a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Shiff, the lead representative of the Democratic Party in the Committee.
This procedure, according to Shifah, “has halted the issuance of intelligence documents”, has damaged the morale of analysts and has “deficitly reflected the disparate views”.
But Shiff and the Democrats claim that there was no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom's analysts to raise their conclusions under the “designed or political interpretation”.
Preliminary results of the Congress' investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of an investigation by the chief inspector of the Pentagon, which was opened after the complaints of Centcoma analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress while the Chief Inspector was still investigating.
But he said that "experts sometimes rely on comprehensive data, and the services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital issues relating to national security".
The consequences of the investigation are beyond the scope of whether the targets of American bombings in Iraq and Syria (as the Ministry of Defence has now increasingly approved).
Last year, however, statements raise doubts as to whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other critical points.
The criticism of the Islamic State's intelligence repeats the disputes that took place more than ten years ago when a researcher at Centcoma Gregory Hooker wrote a research article claiming that President George Walker Bush's administration, due to the protest of many analysts, had supported a small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought of what followed the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by the Islamic State ' s intelligence.
Last year, according to officials, the Hukera team concluded that despite the public return statements, oil-fired aircraft belonging to the Islamic State did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary oil-fired plants to sell oil on the black market.
But the opening was not distributed outside the Central Command, as reported in September of the Times.
The then Commander of Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year for witness testimony in the Senate, which many Members considered to be too optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The United States has won 4 consecutive rounds of women's grass hockey, thus approaching a decisive deal with Britain.
By killing three goals in a match that ended up winning over Japan with an account of 6-1, Katie Bam opened the account in Thursday with the first two goals for the US women's grass hockey team when the Americans won a win over the India team with an account of 3-0.
Five heads in two games must be a memorable achievement, but Bem, 27 years old, says she's not sure if she would ever do something like that.
"I don't know," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who follow their goals.
That's what she knows: an account of Americans 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan's win with a 2-0 on Thursday.
British and US teams will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams apply to the quarter, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams, and who will be the second.
The winner will avoid meetings with a strong team of opponents from the Netherlands, the leaders of another group, shortly after the four-finals begin.
But the Saturday game shows that the Americans here made a noise of their unexpected series four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams in London games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time, took a hockey club on the grass when she was 3 (the older twins played in this kind of sport in Drexel), and joined the national gathering at the age of 16 and became her youngest in history.
She missed Olympiad in 2008, when she did not go through the final round.
Then came 2012 when she and her teammate did not care.
The following year Coyg Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training," Bem said.
In London, we didn't have the productivity that we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the account in the first half of the game with a hand with a short distance.
India went to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team was surprised and kept account 1-0 until the end of the third period when Bem took the initiative in his hands.
She made a long walk with a ball down the left side of the field, then the brake went in the middle and sent the ball firmly to the door, thus giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonzales added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" win was the first on the U.S. door tour to Jacky Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's hit.
Like Bam.
"We are in a good position right now," said Parnhem, but how well it depends on the result of the Saturday game.
In the midst of the absence of the Olympic Games - "day" of the bees on the boat
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be unchanging and inevitable, a combination of competition and aspirations.
It's the Olympic fire itself, and there's the hot façade that's being transferred from the bowl to the swimming pool, to the gymnast, to the triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbors in the coffee line and not hear about Simone Bailey, Katie Ledeka or the enemy between Michael Felps and Chad de Clo.
There's still Logan Duley.
Duly, the first time in the Olympics, a beautician with hooks on her cheeks, could be among the celebrities that are shown in the prizes that sponsors and life-threatening advertising roles, if he were a hunter, a gymnast, or even a fettor.
But 28-year-old Douli from Lake Forest in California is fighting for gold in the Olympics on the boat.
The Olympics don't highlight all the events the same way.
In addition to the centre, partly in the shade, there are sports that are not generally recognized: fire from a pneumatic gun, fire from the bow, badminton, tekwondo.
Brass will always be with us for a long time.
But if I'm allowed to defend my personal passion, let me draw your attention to the modest promise of the bees on the boat.
Although battalions have been an Olympic sport since 2000 when they debuted in Sydney, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many of the people who have been asked about me have not been aware that they are generally the Olympics.
This could be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States had sent athletes to the competitions, they had never won medals in boots on the boat, and their athletes had not gone to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russian usually share male awards, while Chinese and Canadians are female.
Dun Dun from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will protect their London gold medals this year.
But the boots on the boat have the charm of an outsider, especially because for the uneducated ear they are more associated with a circus college than with the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a grounded enthusiasm.
Indeed, they have a comical potential — a caricature of endless bees — but also the discovery of gymnastics and bees in water, two types of sports that they mostly combine.
The word "butt" comes from the Spanish word "el trampoline", which means "tramplin for bees in water."
The winners of the victory are on a giant battalion, which is about 30 feet [30 ft] in the air, and they must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, gears, and salt) until the final landing on the foot.
They are assessed by performance, complexity and time travel, according to the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two sportsmen from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will meet in Rio.
The most widely distributed Olympic course is ahead.
Medal applicants must go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, there in the field.
They aim not only for the final drawing or the starting wall, but also for the telecamera, to another hostile alien: the world record or the Olympic record.
This persistent desire is noble, worthy of praise, even fanatical — and is enough to make even the viewer pass away.
But it, in my opinion, is a little tired when you look at the game.
He's got the boots on his boot.
The battalion is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, looks like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then no effort up again.
And, of course, they don't do without competition or difficulty, but there's no crazy turn to finish throughout the program, there's no long-sleeves, just a weird, exhausting waste of time and gravity.
It's the closest to the day of Olympic sports.
Women ' s qualification contests and then the final will take place on Friday, day-to-day broadcasts in Eastern Europe; men on Saturday, also on the hour.
NBC will broadcast the final in the agenda from 14:00 a.m. to both days.
A peaceful, beautiful moment is expected in the course of the Olympic Consciousness, which can be easily seen in the common bag.
And if awareness increases can only be achieved under the leadership and objectivization of male athletes, as the Wall Street Journal has recently suggested, the U.S. Gymnasium men, Douli is just waiting for her new enchanted crowd of fans.
Protest generation in Ethiopia, the former US ally
Angry protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the Government.
The witnesses say that dozens of protestors were killed during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of a breakup?
For the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly developing economy.
But in recent months, anti-governmental protests have shaken the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
Only in the last week did thousands of people go to the streets, demanding radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s response was cruel.
The witnesses claimed that police officers had shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video recordings from the protests allegedly withdrawn at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands to the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Rog project in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly — even a new suburban train in Addis Ababa.
Her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, was hardly a model of democracy — human rights organizations constantly referred to governmental repression - opposition in the territory of the State, by the fact that dissidents had been forced to silence.
Many of them were imprisoned, imprisoned, killed or expelled in remote deserts.
But it can change.
"If people constantly push and leave them no choice but to protest, there will be a resurrection," said Seium Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
A generation of protests.
The complaints are numerous, starting with land use, ending with the government coalition.
Following the widely criticised elections last year, the Government party and its allies have fully challenged the opposition and are now controlling 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the Eritrean border are growing; fighting for this uncertain, controversial border brought hundreds of lives to June.
Analysts are afraid that separatist groups, which have been destroyed more or less in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use volleyball and rearm.
A number of factors explain why the bitter feelings of a few years of breathing in the depths of the soul are now raging.
First, it would seem quite harmless: smartphones.
In just the past few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate in social networks, as cheap smartphones have become popular and Internet services have improved.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through the proxy server that they hide where they are.
A few young Ethiopians said that this was the way they were organized for protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhar, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amharah are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara from the predominantly Christian high mountains of Ethiopia has flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of which are Muslims and live in low areas.
But that also changes.
"We will work together at one start," said Mulat Hamec, leader of Oromo.
Major protests took place in the areas of Amharic and Oromo.
Many of the Amharic and Oromo feel that in Ethiopia, the ethnic group of Tigris is unduly dominated, which is approximately 6 per cent of the population, which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have predicted danger.
Analysts argue that he had particularly experienced the first signs of discontent and used investigators to obtain data and dissipate opponents.
"The current regime is not sound enough," said Abdi, an analyst for conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Heilemariam Desalen, appeared and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was born from the Tigris region in northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say it is not used to trust the security services controlled by Tigris.
Many fear that this will lead to even greater bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such tensions in 2005, after thousands of people protested that, as analysts have said, there were apparently elections that the Government had called for and then had the results.
During the subsequent repressions, many Protestants were killed, even in less than the last few months, and this period of anxiety was relatively rapid.
Development experts expressed appreciation to Ethiopia ' s leaders for the long-term development of infrastructure, such as a new international train and significant success in the fight against poverty.
But this clearly did not stop the increase in internal discontent by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, the protests in Honduras, the city of Amharic, attacked businesses belonging to Tigris, and anti-Tigerian hatred in social networks became comprehensive.
Analysts claim that the protestors make the United States and other Western allies uncomfortable.
The U.S. Government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it had recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose its power in the already unstable region.
"And it's gonna be hard to go through this stuff," said Abdi.
Donald Tramp explains his statement that IGIL was founded by Obama, "sarkasm"
Donald J. Tramp tried to replace the last conflict, covering his pre-election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when several times this week he claimed that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the candidate to address the American people in a reasonable manner as president of the Republican Party.
It also put his substitutes, who tried to protect him during a period of anxiety, into an unwholesome situation, because they had to explain the statements that he probably did not mean.
On Wednesday evening, Tramp strongly insisted on his statement on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the President and Clinton had founded IGIL.
But in a post on Twitter early this Friday, Tramp wrote that he was just committing suicide.
This post was a direct opposition to the claim made on the day before, when Tramp said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his indictment.
When Hugh Hewitt, a radio-conservator, tried to help the Tramp to ease his speech, reminded him that Obama wanted to destroy IGIL, the candidate for the president of the Republican party did not take the opportunity.
The last scandal raged when Tramp tried to refocus his campaign on the economy in the face of a decline in ratings.
Trump and Clinton spoke with competing economics in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Tramp tried again to get back to the subject.
Once again, he turned to Twitter and warned that Clinton's plans would lead to tax increases, and he said it was boring.
Tramp used sarcasm as an excuse before.
At the end of July, after he came up with a general criticism, practically expressing the idea that the Russian should break Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his comments, saying, "I'm kidding at last."
Such an approach enables Tramp to go beyond the limits allowed in political terms and to take their words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing some of the messages in response to his worshipers to see how they are doing, and then "explain them on the other side, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, an expert on communication, examining the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is careful in his statements and knows that they are sloppy enough to treat them differently.
Instead of easing speeches for a large electorate, Tramp has taken even more sensitive tone in the last days, while his rating continues to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that the Trump is entering Clinton with a large turnout in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and is going to Florida with it.
Although Tramp usually tries not to apologize for the provocations that he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and not understanding his sense of humor.
But since Tramp has been the object of the presidential campaign in recent months, his jokes have put his faithful allies in a horrific position: they must publicly support him, no matter what provocations he may have been.
Rudolf U. Juliani, former mayor of New York, who is one of the most well-known Deputy Trump, has made serious efforts to protect the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," Juliani said when asked him about the credibility of the Tramp's claim that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true that, before Obama IGIL was almost unknown to a small organization, he called it a non-proportional threat, absolutely unjust, and that's why it all happened because he took the army out of Iraq.
Most of the medium-sized Republicans are convinced that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as the Secretary of State, has allowed IGI to develop, as it has not been able to cope with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Tramp continued to attack the media on the media for the sensitization of every word he said and foresight towards it.
He looked at the poor, unhappy TV experts trying to tell him, and he said, "They're weak!"
Some of the democracies have made a mockery of the Thramp's excuses, as a further confirmation that it is not due in the presidents.
Once a brewed coffee goes back to Greenpoint.
The Verb café was surrounded by only the available places in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but a good coffee was delivered for 15 years.
Of course, they pulled her out of her window room at Bedford Avenue.
The Soup Sherry shop, which took place in Verb in summer 2014, is selling soap in the form of cakes.
The local people mourned her as the last loss in the refreshing city.
The artist Molly Krabapl wrote in Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is destroyed, and Verb has now become a soap store."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, being updated.
The Rebirth of Verb was opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
In the new Verbe there are Wi-Fi and credit cards, but there are some same staff and a simple atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The new “Verba” is the head of Sisko Rodríguez, an old coffee maker who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to offer him a new place, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodríguez, who was 36 years old, left a lot in his old age.
"Verb" works with the same beige distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It even contains the old "Verba" patterns.
But Rodríguez said he would also like to experiment.
He proposed new rituals.
The menu presents sandwiches with bacon, eggs and cheese, and there is a capper topping or a burning bow.
There's a guard of a bad character.
The coffee is no longer served with beer, but freshly baked juices are now being prepared.
Nine months later, Rodríguez said that he drew attention to the constant flow of old customers.
"Many of the former customers also paid prices from Williamsberg," he said.
In one recent resurrection, Rebecca Oliveira was one of such customers.
Olivera, who was 34 years old, had lived in Williamsberg before and often visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After the lockdown, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me at Verbe," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, although on that day instead of the usual ice coffee she ordered a cup of tea, another newspaper.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-standing client, has been faithfully visiting Verb since 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same thing.
"In fifteen minutes of eight, every day, like in hours, I came, and they prepared my bagel with butter and all the stuff," he said.
Rodríguez said he wanted to experiment and introduce new controls into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal is still making an ordinary order, but at some point he's changing something with the help of a bacon, egg or cheese on a beige with all its ways.
Rodríguez said he was not offended that the store had once taken over the old place.
In addition, the owners of Soup Sherry offered to make a special soap for Verba, using coffee made in a cold way as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree to their proposal," Rodriguez said.
The permanent inhabitants of Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved this caffeine.
One of these new clients moved the menu into Polish, and Rodríguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the autumn to make his new neighbors feel desirable.
There are other benefits in the new place.
The local point for the sale of juices is intended to be poured into bottles and to sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is a likelihood that the caffeine will join the nearest building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Verb" will include their favorites in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a constant client and shared that he was killed in the heat when they were closed.
When the coffee shop opened up in the new place, Whitt said that, coming in and ordering a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
"How long have I wanted to feel this aroma," he admitted.
Depressive food of depression in the "Plot Trapeza"
In March 1933, shortly after the President's resignation, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat in the Oval Cabinet.
As a gurman, President Roosevelt loved the fashion scenes of the Fifth Avenue, for example, Fua Gra and the Maryland Hare Soup.
Its menu on that day was more modest: fried eggs in tomato sauce, potato powder and dessert pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband, Andrew Cou, added, "This was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
Women living in Brooklyn Heights are experts in food history.
The last book of Koua, "Rago of China", was about the Chinese cuisine in America, and Zigelman told the story of life in a single apartment in the Lower East Side through food in his book House 97 on the street of Fruit Garden.
Their new joint work on the "Silver Trapeza", which will be published on Tuesday by the Harper publication, is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
To some extent, they have met with the reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple, tasteful restaurant in the Fletharon Quarter, which has been working since 1929, in the year of the Birjevov crash.
Zigelman, 54, ordered slurry cheese and butterboard with pieces of olives, and Cou, 57, took Indian, potato powder and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple considered it an appropriate starting point for a discussion of food in the days of Depression.
"The roulettes used a great deal of demand," said Zigelman.
There was an Arabic roulette, a liver roulette, a cotton roulette.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that made it possible to grow the ingredient.
Imagine that you ate as much peanuts as you needed for dinner.
Who's sick.
"He must have been lying in a yellow rock," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
The women's groups were prepared for farm men, and the freshly cooked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who fed hungry Europeans during the First World War. The "Plot Trapeza" describes how the country managed to stop being a country of abundance in the second place.
"It was the time when food became a central, unforgivable theme for Americans," Kou explained, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Similarly, the new budget management was not easy: puzzles, such as roulettes and capacitors, became the main food products; the capacitor was "a wonderful way to exploit the compounds," Zigelman noted, as the pore could hide the unappetite ingredients under a thick layer of sous.
Fresh fruit was replaced by more expensive dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the backbone of American food for many years, has become an economical luxury.
Strange mixes have been tried because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary health.
By studying the book, which includes recipes, Zigelman prepared the observance of that era: a sealed bow, carved with aarhus oil.
"This supplement to the lunch table has not been successful," Kou said.
Siegelman added, "That was very strange."
Arkais oil does not exactly fit the liver.
This was characteristic of many domestic recipes.
As never before and ever since, household specialists — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Office from 1923 to 1943 — have managed the country’s food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budgeters”, to accept challenges, and to transform the bud into protruding spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
"Stolen trapeze" is the epitome of curious historical facts.
The Government's reaction to hungry citizens, for example, is particularly marked by the position of President Herbert Guver in the spirit of "let the pirogues go."
Publicly carrying a simple farm strip of the state of Iowa during his childhood, he was fed as a thin millionaire who became.
"He liked the continental kitchen, for example, fish with grape juice," Kou said.
He was practically in a golden table, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically distracted from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to give an example of his own desire.
As noted in the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economy that was totally not interested in taste, and this led to the White House “not only using the most edible food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly prepared”.
Many of the culinary receptions of the Times of Depression were forgotten as soon as the country got up again.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Zigelman, and how science has been used to prepare food.
Spouses tell us that during the writing of the book, they were better able to understand the food habits of the mother of Zigelman — that she could not eat, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being careless about eating," Kou said.
Siegelman remembers, "She poisoned people in a whole series."
There was one unpleasant case with the propitrons.
When the dishes in Eisenberg's relax, they got a dessert with Kou, which they prepared home: a dessert from blackberries, which President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a blackfish," said Zigelman, adding that it was a common reception -- to give humble recipes a brothel.
It was not only blackish, a little bit of pain, sugar, water, and cover.
All unsolicitedly loaded the bed in a narrow, brown, lipid.
To my surprise, it was not bad.
I've asked for extras twice.
With the voice of a trusted budget collector, he said to the woman, "There would be no obstacles to a small-scale Greek ore."
The arrest of the figures on the mass dragon in the Hovana Stock Exchange extended until 14 November
The Press Court left before 14 November under arrest of the figures on the mass dragon in the Havana Stock Exchange, in response to the relevant application for investigation.
There are 14 people in charge.
Let us recall that on 14 May, a massive battle took place at the Hovan Square, with several hundred people leaving Central Asia and the North Caucasus using weapons, resulting in the deaths of three people.
The former head of the headquarters of Yuri Chabuevou and the lawyer, the founder of the public organization Health Nation, Alexander Bocharnik, was charged with murder.
The question of the second pension index for 2016 can be resolved within the next two or three weeks.
On 12 August, the Vice-Chairman of the Government of the RF Olga Golodeck announced this during a visit to the Bryan Region.
We have specific parameters to increase the pension in order to mitigate the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Economists are now undermining the results of the six-year period, and we will complete this work within the next two or three weeks," says the Hunger Interfax.
Commenting on the proposed chapter of the Centre for Strategic Development by Alexei Cudrin, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the topic was not addressed in the Cabinet.
At the end of July, it was known that the Government had agreed on the position of the full pension index in 2017.
The stone and the Grigorian went to the finals of the small-caliber-gun competition.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamenski and Kirilla Grigoriyan went to the finals of the small-calibre-shooting competition from the Olympics in Brazil.
As TAS reports, Sergei Kamenski has picked 629 balls and took the first place, a new Olympic record of qualifications.
Cyril Grigorian became the second - 628.9.
There were eight best athletes in the final.
The stone is a world record in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition Fethollah Gulen requires an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup in Turkey.
"I require the independent international commission to investigate the attempt to convert the State," says the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition also said that "if any part of the charges will be confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gulen refused to participate in the coup, stressing that his organization had never claimed political power.
The Istanbul Court had previously arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethollah Guilen.
Recall that a military coup attempt took place in Turkey at night from 15 to 16 July.
Gilead companies reimburse the costs of legal services during a patent dispute with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to recover the costs of legal services it has incurred in connection with the severity of a hepatitis patent with Merck & Co Inc's drug manufacturer, the Federal District Judge has decided.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in damages for the violation of two Merck patents related to Gilead's medicines, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the US judge found several violations by Merck, including a lie under oath and other non-ethical actions.
At the time of trial in the fourth U.S. Federal District Court judge Beth Lebson Freeman said that Gilead had the right to reimburse the costs incurred during the dispute.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 per cent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck were brought before each other in court, claiming their rights to laboratory work based on sophosbuvir, an active ingredient of Gilead medicine.
Armed forces established with the support of the United States claim to have taken over full control of Manbij in the Islamic State
The armed forces established with the support of the United States took full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last remaining in the city of the Islamic State had left, the representative of the group reported on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now cleaning the city after the remaining group of fighters that were hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages who were detained by the military, told Reuters Sharfan Darviš of the Manbij military council's alliance with the SDS.
"The country is under our control now, but we are carrying out cleaning operations," he told the Reuters agency.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of federal tax
Hillary Clinton announced its 2015 tax returns on Friday, which showed that the candidate for the Democratic Party and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in charity contributions, mainly in the Clinton Fund, the former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in fees for statements, and the former State Secretary declared income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her stay in the State Department.
The potential vice president Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane from Virginia, along with his wife, Anna Holton, issued tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"The Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to establish a standard of financial transparency," said head of the Clinton pre-election headquarters, Jennifer Palmeri.
Unlike them, Donald Tramp is hiding behind false excuses and violates his past pledges to publish his tax returns.
It is a common case for candidates in the Presidents of the United States to publish their tax declarations, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Tramp and his lawyers called the verification of the State Tax Service as a reason for his refusal to publish his tax returns.
"Your move," wrote Twitter adviser to the pre-election headquarters Clinton Jan Sams, referring to the declaration of a candidate from a democratic party.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trampa Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow the Trampo to issue them until the checks were completed.
Critics of Trampa, including a candidate in the presidents of the Republican Party in 2012, Mitta Romni and other republican members, said that his refusal raised questions about his status, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other connections, including with Russia.
Clinton caught up with the issue and released an online video on Friday, which focused on the issuing republicans who convinced Trampa to report the tax.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during the Michigan economy.
"He refuses to do what everyone has done without the exception of a presidential candidate for ten years: to announce his tax declarations," she said to the assembled.
Politico reported that Tramp had not paid any or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the business suspect of the New York Times on Friday quoted many tax lawyers and accountants who believed that the case may still exist.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of a dispute in the presidential elections.
Clinton supported a rule called the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would guarantee that people who received more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, offered Trampu to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under IRS, and that Tramp was afraid not of a tax collection agency but of voters.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters issued tax returns up to 2007.
Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration for 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was the source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index savings fund, and Clintons reported dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Chili powder condoms and fireworks increase protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmental struggles in Tanzania have used a non-traditional way to prevent elephants from sinking in human settlements, leaving them with condoms filled with chili powder.
The method was effective, and Honeyguide Foundation, which came to its head a few years ago, together with the American Nature Protection Committee, took on its progress, training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step, way of protecting their homes and crops, not causing harm to animals.
Many have used a copy before to protect themselves.
On Friday will be the World Day of elephants, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"Since we have invented a set of tools ..., we have seen a change in the relations within these communities, which makes them much more confident that they will not be able to leave elephants on their fields without causing elephants to harm," said Honeyguide Executive Director Damian Bell.
The first two steps are the burning of the jaw before the breaking edge of the elephant and the signaling of the horn.
If he couldn't escape, they'd drop the so-called cloud of chili.
The chili powder mixed with soil is placed in the reservoir with a cap and its end is bent, and only a pen is left outside.
When the condoms are burned, it is washed with a groove, spraying a small dust powder of chili in the air.
One dune is usually enough to turn the elephant on the other side.
The ultimate measure is the power plant that shoots the Roman candles in the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Turkey has not yet returned to Turkey to 32 Turkish diplomats who left the country after the attempted coup in July this year.
Such data was brought by the head of the media of Turkey, Mevolut Chaušoglu, in a conversation with local journalists.
At the first stage, we have called 208 staff diplomats to continue their work in the centre.
32 of them have not returned without objective reasons and explanations," said the head of the Turkish foreign policy department.
Recall that in July Turkey attempted a coup d'état.
The authorities formally stated that the coup had failed, and reported that more than six thousand people had been detained, including the war crimes of the highest and middle rank.
As a result of the attempted coup, 290 people were killed, according to the media of Turkey.
The Jewish director strongly criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's telephone code for "asking" Arabs – reported the RT News channel
The French director of Jewish origin has launched a scandal in the media, finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli phone code, while the officials refer to "asks" by Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoa, expressed his dissatisfaction with taking Kempinski Bristol to Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lansman hotel, he tried to find Israel in the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, had not been mentioned among the States in which to call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of new Germany, Israel has been excluded and eliminated?
He wrote Lanceman.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In the search for an explanation, the director raised this issue at the level of the hotel administration.
The answer he received there, according to Lansman, was "shocked him."
Clark Hotel said that the measure was "a surprising solution to Kempinski's chain of command."
The reason behind this step has caused even greater anger on the part of the director.
"Most of our Arab guests, and they demanded that Israel's code be removed," he said, according to Lanzman, who served at the hotel.
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany James Hadas-Handelsman called the case "a terrible sight," reports Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's really a terrible sight.
What happened in Germany, and that's what happened in this chain of hostages, is even more obvious.
There's no need to explain.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," the officer said.
The incident caused a slight resonance on the Internet; people called it scandal.
Some claimed that Kempinski's hotel simply went "on" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"We would be ashamed," said another post, saying that the hotel located on the famous Kurfurstendamm street is close to the synagogue.
The hotel itself has hurried off any charges, calling it "inadvertently" and "excuse yourself" before Lansman, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the fast-set list," quoted the representative of the Kempinski Hotel Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use liquefied gas and resin bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The students met with the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday to protest against government reform of the State education system.
The police used liquefied gas and resin bullets against the protestors.
The riots began when police officers tried to drive the students away, resulting in the use of resin bullets and liquefied gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their concern about plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 state secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some of the protest participants were seen writing on the graffiti walls against President Michael Temer's temporary duty.
The last protest took place only a few days after the protests went out on the streets to support the removal of President Dilmu Rusef, when the Senate voted for her influence.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% — reported RT Business portal
With the abolition of sanctions, the slave trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, according to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Jagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in the interest of Russian companies in conducting business in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing their contacts with Iran, and new companies are ready to gain market access.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The increase in trade has been achieved through the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the Ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that this year, Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission to Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mainly tourist, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top-20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia.
You can be sure that last year's record of the number of Iranian tourists who visited Russia will be beaten," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Jez, where the memories of ancient Persian civilization remain in good condition," he said.
The State continues to twist its cracks into the defence-industrial complex.
A reason for dismissal has become a "systematic failure" of the mandates of the Director General of Almaz-Antei, "a loss of confidence" and "a loss of confidence".
The leader of NGOs has been appointed Gennadius Benderski for the next three years.
Disengagement information appeared only on Thursday evening and did not generate a broad resonance in the media.
What can explain such silence in the context of the large arms embargo?
It is likely that the RF leadership does not want any hearings or negative assumptions to be disseminated in the public environment.
This further confirms that the defence-industrial complex (OPC) has many problems and the State does not want to draw attention to them from society.
The removal of Necodova is certainly an important development in terms of order in the industry.
Almaz NGO is the main business of the concert, which specializes in the production of marine and ground-based Zenithn-Raite Complexs (SRCs).
Almaz is currently working on the establishment of the Polyment Redute and Morpheus CCC, which is planned to be installed on new curves, frigates, esminaries and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia Dmitry Cornev portal believes that the non-profit release is due to a break in the deadlines for the projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007, and the construction was expected in 2013.
"Poliment Redout" must become the main WFP system on the latest IMF ships.
According to the information I receive, for several years no successful test has been carried out.
True, as far as I can judge, there's no clear fault in Almaz," said Cornev.
The expert is afraid that the delay in the operation may also occur with the C-500.
The project's expertise has not yet been completed, but the first complexes must enter the army during 2016.
In Minobore, it is assured that “the work is on schedule and will all be completed within the time limit set”, although in 2014 the department recognized that there were problems with the development of C-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Necorodov, who has been led by Almaz since 2011.
Cornev noted that project deadlines could be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his view, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information on internal processes in OPC and business management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large money, as you know, loves silence.
The director of defence companies usually withdraws from positions of his own will, under the agreement of the parties, or is transferred to another work.
In this case, the removal has occurred in public, even if it has not been resonated.
This suggests that the leader of Almaza was perhaps a quick figure and opposed to the lower "disorders".
In all cases, the State no longer intends to do so.
It will eliminate those who prefer to dispute with the Mino-Debour institutions and do not fulfil the tasks assigned to them.
At the same time, the RF's leadership seeks to punish the trained managers (manufacturers on Starships).
Improved attention is given to the issues of the sector by the President himself.
Vladimir Putin is head of the Military Industrial Commission and is conducting periodic re-arming meetings.
The Kremlin protects a number of OPC managers, seeking to have a loyal part of the directors, who will carry out the duties they have received above the order.
This is a far-reaching policy, but there are no other instruments available to the State in the face of corruption and lack of normal competition in the OPC.
The complex defence situation, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical environment encourages the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of management in the OPC, the RF leadership is taking very successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The personnel of the army acquired a new quality with the arrival of the Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu.
It is hard to believe that the President has taken up a well-known reservation, "You want peace, prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military power of the Soviet Union and the nuclear parity reached in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which secured the influence of Moscow on the continent.
In all cases, she worked very effectively in the bipolar system.
This proved to be a lack of war on the European continent and a relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The "winners" trade in the cold war has resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of attacks in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world", please do not remain a calm corner.
Despite the overall poverty, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
Under such circumstances, our country's only allies remain fleets and armies.
Strengthening the military capacity will enable Moscow to resist national interests more effectively and to move to new world policies.
Scotland's Kallum Skinner leans toward the finish line, resulting in British taking a bicycle gold.
Scotland's Kallum Skinner was looking for a triumph in a male commando in Rio last night, resulting in the British commando trio protecting its title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glazgo was in the role of his best friend, Mr. Chris Hoi, and the young man was proud of his own history, wandering in the finish line to win a victory for the Favor team from New Zealand.
Britain declared the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, when Hoi declared the right to a fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they've repeated the trick after they've done a modest six at the March World Championship on Trailers in London, despite Hoi's career as of then.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of an expert from Jamie Staff.
They did it just once when the Hindus showed up.
The care of Hoa also created the void that Keian Emmadi and Matt Cremton were trying to fill.
Skinner was a man held by British coaches, seeing the potential in Scotland, which has now been realized.
Hindus, Kenny, and Hoi champions four years ago, and Skinner set up an Olympic record of qualifications, but the norm was taken over by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported it.
The change of strategy was a major part of the transformation, where Hindus went on a larger transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
He watched from his seat as an invited BBC expert and took the view of Skinner, Kenny and Hindus when they entered the Pedestal.
The 23-year-old Glazgo Skinner said, "This is a simple comparison."
I'm here to do everything I can and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world championships.
That was amazing.
There's no better way to win.
After the London triumph in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoe, Hyndes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on track after a failed start.
He later declined to comment, and there was no way to appeal by UK competitors.
There was no such issue this time in the greatest victory.
Hyndes said, "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags at the tribunal."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We played so many races with a world name that winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for the country that won seven of the 10 names of goons in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress in the past five months, then the winner is waiting for another five days of success.
In the form shown by Kenny, it is not beyond the opportunity to present, as he repeats Hoa, the winner of three Olympic gold medals in one game.
This would show how Kenny, who was 12 years younger than Hoya, who was also born on March 23rd (it seems to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also Steve Redgray, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister’s birthday) brings his account to six gold medals and one silver medal.
It'd be like Hoa's.
The next time, Kenny competes in a syringe that starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old exit from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your friends.
It's not easy to win each other, if it's true.
He said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he'll have to get a kingdom."
It was the only day you played medals, but it was the next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Berk and Owen Doll are the fastest four-kilometre team race to pursue four.
They ended up at 3:51,943.
The world record set for the 2012 London gold win is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will be exactly in focus.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, before the qualifying train, when officials needed him to measure his weight.
In the relevant women ' s event, which is resumed and completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Roussel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katy Archibald from Milngavi have improved the world record, showing time 4:13.360.
The British team has come to believe that it is up to a possible team of bikers to take ownership of the Olympic Games and earn a medal.
After indeed the exceptional demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were weakened in the gradual preparation of Rio.
There were dramas on the second level, not the last one, from the post of technical director Shein Satton in April due to charges of sexism and harassment, and major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the race of the first evening on the wheel, it seems that the legendary glory of Britain now appears to be achieved at the right time, perhaps once again.
Future of the Portland metallurgical plant under threat due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminium plant in Victoria, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is threatened by the fact that the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of the owners of the plant, is going to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This step is a consequence of the decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend the subsidies granted to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed grant for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs can be threatened by Alcoa in Portland.
The total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — can be in the risk zone as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metallurgical plant at Point Henry, which led to the closure of the power plant in England last year.
The Portland metallurgical plant of Alcoa is losing money and risking closure.
These actions resulted in a thought about the future of a plant that has continued for several years, originally due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later because of the price of the plant.
The AGL company, which provides a large aluminium plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrob Walli, reported that it expects the other three owners to also take steps to break the contract.
The controlling share of the plant belongs to the joint short-term company Alcoa and Alumina and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp have fewer shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to work, that is, the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not be stopped," she said.
According to the AGL, the contracts mentioned are so-called ‘hewed contracts’ that were to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month separation period, so they actually end in 2017.
"As a result, AGL still expects these contracts to bring their share of revenue in the financial year 2017," the electricity company said.
Any potential impact on AGL's profit from the financial year 2018 has been limited to the forecasting of a strong future market for optical electricity prices.
The AGL company stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its accounts for $187 million in terms of “provisional disbursement”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to operate a metallurgical plant or to provide electricity to a metallurgical plant”.
The American company stated that in 2010 it had concluded a twenty-year contract with Loy Yang, which had to enter into force in November of this year, but it still had to explain why it had broken the contract.
The analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Talking to analysts earlier this week, AGL Chief of Operations Steven Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year, and Tomago is about 900 megawatts.
If both plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
For us, as for the manufacturer, it will be bad," he said.
Not only the star of the Cardassian show, Candall on the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, model and fourth daughter of Clan Cardashian-Jenner, mother-in-law Chris, appeared on the leading September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who was the brand Estee Lauder, who defiled the fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"When I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at the cover and cried," wrote Kendall.
The news of the siege was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of the Cardashian Family?), prepared video reality, in which the entire Cardashian-Jenner family (debossiers Rob and Caitlin, also joined by the most popular grandfather of the show business, producer of the Cardashian Family, Ryan Sikrest), forgot about the appearance of the sister on the siege, and at the end of the classic turn: they planned a party surprise.
It's a standard subject line for almost all episodes of children's television shows dedicated to birthdays. (Creet says, "You thought we'd forgotten about you?" with the sincerity of the multiplicity of the program at 8 a.m.), but Chris needed to get this glory somehow to other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have no doubt entered the new epoch of Cardassian show.
Let her sister Kendall Kim fall on Vogue's cover earlier (she showed up with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is the achievement itself.
The September issue is the most sold Vogue issue per year.
A large number of advertisements (see Facionista Portal, 615 pages from the previous 832-page issue).
News of who is coming from the star on its cover is expected to be so impatient that in the last two years, photographs of the magazine have flown to the official ad.
Among the previous women who fell into a trap are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have, of course, been more "nomaignities that work in models" than "nomadic models".
The award winner Oscar and the brand Dior Jennifer Lawrence was presented on the bill in 2013, a year after Lady Gage was awarded the award.
But even in the unlikely case, if Jenner, whom the magazine described as the "extensive model" of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in a bad company.
These celebrities are not family members of known people, reality-show stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (Genner wants to fall into all these categories).
These are really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Baionse, who appeared on the cover last year, this year was one of the most successful careers for the Lemonade album.
Of course, we're not all happy with Jenner's success.
The situation of Jenner in the world of fashion, because of her last TV reality star, has always been a joke.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gidji Hadid, who called them "the battles of the moment".
These moods were again confused after the news of the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue cover.
But it doesn't make sense to get involved in discontent.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September Vogue.
It is a supermodel in all meanings of that word.
She's defiling Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you a tonic cream from Estee Lauder.
She, yes and all her sisters, sells your photos to you in their own apps available on payroll.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter of LIVE.
And at free time, she may still be seeing her sister Cortney and her children, she's participating in the reality show on TV.
Public legal centres refuse to serve 160,000 people per year
Each year more than 160,000 of the least-protected representatives of the population refuse to serve in public law centres, as this sector is preparing for an impact that will further reduce funding for and so on.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who are not able to fight unfair property loss and so on — have already been denied, seeking free legal assistance and representation.
Public legal services, which are already beyond their scope, are preparing for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centres have to lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of the Public Legal Centres of Queensland James Farrell said that according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands of people have been denied each year.
Farrell said that if the federal government decision was not cancelled, the situation would only worsen.
"The public legal centres in Queensland are constantly getting insufficient funding: this means that thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who are forced out of a relationship with others, people with unmanageable and devastating debts, families who are through divorce, unjustly fired workers — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will reduce funding by 30 per cent since June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected people in Queensland will be forced to address complex legal issues without assistance.
We call upon the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis to cancel these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need when they face legal problems.
Last year, the Government of the State has fulfilled its obligation to raise funding for free legal aid to the country's average.
Now is the time to draw attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and the Government of Palaštuk's time to engage in this important work.
Donald Tramp's pre-election headquarters was brought to court after the officer allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to reports from New York, Donald Trampa's pre-election headquarters was brought to court: it is alleged that the headquarters did not do anything after the announcement that his operating director in North Carolina threatened the staff member with a gun when they were walking to the gypsum in February.
The incident was described in a court case filed in the court of the state in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, a former program manager in the pre-election headquarters of the state.
Bordini said he waited a few months to solve the problem internally, but he realized that "it won't happen."
Director Earl Phillip "takes out a gun, puts his right index finger on his hip and puts a bow on Vincent's knee," says Bordini in a complaint.
In his complaint to the local and regional pre-election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more persons had become participants in similar incidents with Phillip, and that he was approved.
"We don't have to shoot guns to harm them," Bordini said in a complaint.
The wish took place only two days after the Presidents of the Republican Party made a fulor, he told the North Carolina audiences that "the people of the Second Amendment" - known as the owners of arms and their fans - could begin to act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could choose judges.
Trampa's pre-election headquarters said that the media had removed his words from the context and that he had not expressed support for violence.
In his complaint, Bordini called for compensation from the pre-election headquarters for inadvertent control, and from Phillip, for the threat of physical violence, abuse of action and moral damage.
The representative of the Trappa Hope Hicks is pleased to reply to the request for a comment.
Trying to talk to Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Philip had recently left the pre-election headquarters.
In response to the call to his consulting firm, the Innovation Consulting Services, no one has called.
The candidate for the president of the Republican Party, Donald Tramp, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg District Court (Charlott).
Britain must send the necessary Olympic spirit and expand Hytro
It will also bring restoration and prosperity not only to our people's places here and throughout London, but also throughout the country.
As I believe it was the huge advantage of Hitro, as was the case with London 2012, where we have made every effort to benefit our people and regions from the game.
The Olympic Games have been of great benefit to Stratford and East End.
And we'll do it again, creating opportunities for locals and companies near Hitro.
We will create 10,000 new traineeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London in 2012, those who thought that the task of expanding the Hitro would be too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be in a difficult situation on the world stage.
Skeptics went wrong in 2012, and they will be found to be wrong about Hitro.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hitro answers any question about him.
Like the Olympic Games Hitrou, it is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion of economic growth, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a wonderful team in Hitro, which has implemented a programme of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment in time and within the budget, from T5, which is chosen by the best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the two world's most busy refugee camps.
They are now ready to provide a third flight-in-the-board, confirmed by 16 billion private investment pounds.
The 2012 London Olympics have been a great success for Britain, and I am sure that the expansion of Hytro will also be.
It is time for us to put the Olympic spirit in the right direction and to expand Hytro, to ensure our commercial future and to create the heritage of the skills and employment that Britain will be able to boast.

Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing in the "mushroom" on the issue of blocking advertising
For companies that make money on the Internet, trying to turn around software to block advertising is a game in the "bitch" of a company that creates such software.
On Thursday, literally a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block advertising blockers on its website's desktop version, Adblock Plus posted a blog that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the website's version would change the focus of its advertising to make it more difficult for blockers to identify which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims he was able to bypass a new code.
In his blog post, the representative Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "a kind of mutual fight between the community of blockers with an open source code and those who are trying to circumvent it is continuing from the time of the creation of the blockup", and that Facebook might present its own decision in the near future.
The fact that the largest social network in the world has entered the struggle is a clear sign of how big a problem the blockers have become for the industry.
Around 200 million people around the world use advertising blockers, according to the last year's Pagefair and Adobe study; almost four times the number of those using such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users entering Facebook through mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's income from advertising.
However, the company will be looking for a table-based advertising blockers, as mobile advertising blockers are ineffective in Facebook mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
However, the advertising in the version of the table is a rather profitable article for Facebook to consider such a step as a beneficial investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its "advertising preferences" tool to give people more control over how they target advertising.
On Thursday Facebook stated that new Adblock filters are causing concern, as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we are planning to solve this problem," said a Facebook representative in an official e-mail.
Advertising blockers are a cruel tool, so instead we focused on creating tools such as Advertising Preferences to hand over management to people.
The woman was transferred to the Swiss highway to the apparent suicide episode
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses, after the woman had moved several vehicles to the highway early in the morning on Thursday in an obvious attempt to commit suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 off the coast in the canton immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman was on the road in the darkness "in despair" and was hit by several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
The victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, was apparently trying to kill himself, hit a number of vehicles, including a truck.
She died in the place.
Several intruders have already been questioned, but the identity of some has not yet been established, has been reported by the police, calling them and anyone else who has witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case, a “logical” step in such a situation, was initiated, said lawyer Gile Hoffsetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be ascertained whether any of the drivers involved will be indicted.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine," Hoffsetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years allow drivers to assume that they will not be held accountable.
In each case, both of which are involved in the darkness of the highway, the newspaper reports that motorists cannot expect a random meeting with a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of the death of indiscriminately, after she struck and killed a man lying on A1 next to Payern at night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, heard the court.
The court found that the police woman, who responded to the extreme challenge, managed the vehicle in a manner that was justified and that the existence of a person on the road was “a perfectly exceptional and unpredictable situation”, said the judge.
Any person who has information about the incident on Thursday near Morge must call the police for 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have been inhabited once, according to NASA's new climate model estimates.
The students from the Nassau Institute of Space Studies of the Year have developed a model for the study of the past Venus, using instruments and algorithms similar to those used by climateologists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have a hot, waterless surface and an atmosphere that was recharged with carbon dioxide, ever having conditions similar to that of the earth.
The students had previously assumed that the small speed of Venus is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modeling suggests that Venus may have had a dispersal atmosphere similar to that of the earth, and it is still slowly turning back.
The model also considered the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but at one time there was enough water and enough geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid extinction.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent thick.
"According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus places the sun on its daily side for almost two months at a time," explained in a press release from GISS Anthony Del Henio.
This heats up the surface of the planet and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as a protection zone for the planet from the essential part of solar heat.
The result is medium climate temperatures, which are, in any case, a few degrees colder than in our days on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development that has previously been suggested by planet study experts.
Although Venus may have been inhabited at one time, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet exposure for several billion years.
Her oceans had been evaporated and her water pair had been burned with ultraviolet radiation.
When her hydrogen flew, there was only a flat atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect — Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model Venus in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy leaves the Avalanche team coach post
Patrick Roy left the post of coach and vice-president of the hockey event Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, referring to the lack of influence during the decision-making process in the team.
The Executive Vice-President/Chief Manager of the Colorado Command Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club was about to start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have performed my duties as chief coach and vice-president of Colorado Avalanche's hockey activities with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I thought seriously about how I could improve this team to give her the depth she needed and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice-president of hockey must be ideally consistent with the organization ' s vision.
It should also have the right to vote in making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best league coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He has brought the club to 112 points and victory in the Central Division, but Colorado has been devastated by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and has played playoffs for the past two years.
The Avalanche team announced an evaluation of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points left for the Wild team to fight for a second easy trip to the Western Conference.
The winner of the Slavium Hall, Roy won four Stanley Cups — two with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oilmen resume negotiations and halt the strike
The oil strike in the North Sea has been suspended, and all parties to the discussion are entering the new round of negotiations, the leading representatives of the parties reported.
The attacks against the oil service company Wood Group were organized on platforms in the North Sea under the leadership of the Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the United and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve current disputes," the joint statement states.
We will hold several full-day meetings for the next few weeks, starting at the beginning of the next week, to look at issues in a fresh light.
The trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first over 25 years, was directed against potential wage cuts of up to 30 per cent.
This year, the Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract staff working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent due to negative market tensions.
The company's interest rates decreased by 10 per cent after the downturn in the rates for contract staff working on the coast in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions will give it space necessary to overcome market decline.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil-gas activities in countries by 10, as it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega-combination with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the low prices of crude oil: the economic situation has deteriorated as a result of the decision to leave the European Union, adopted in June Britain.
The Scottish member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major labour conflicts that have arisen in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, was vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, yes and throughout the country, we need an economy that would work for most, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea in 2016, compared to the average value of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the star rotation at Pleiade's excavation
Kepler's latest space telescope mission helped astronomers gather the most complete of the speeds of the stars in the Pleiades.
New data help astronomers to understand why the stars are returning at different speeds and how the rotation periods relate to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Louis Fishall, a scientific officer of the Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
Pleiade's excavation is in 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars are now only mature; they were born some 125 million years ago.
They're going back as fast as they're never going to.
At their peak speed, these adult stars select large amounts of star wind.
On the way through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds have a braking effect on the stars.
As the star grows older, its speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of each star’s rotation, tracking the time between the occurrence of known star feathers — such as the sun’s fins.
The new speed index suggests that more mass stars are turning slower than less mass stars.
Fishing compares stars to dancers: larger pirates are slower than smaller ones.
"In the Ballet, we'll observe that those who are turning slowly are usually more massive, while those who are turning faster are usually very light stars," Riball said.
As Pleiade's excavation is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars to the speeds of rotation.
"The Pleiade's constellation provides a starting point for the theoretical models of star rotation, both younger and older," Riball said.
We still want to know how, where and why the stars slow down their speed and hang their dance shoes on the iron.
Fish and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the speeds of returning Pleiade in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The research on the activities of the group of detainees in the Crimea of Ukrainian Diversants is conducted by two units, says the Commission.
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of the diversions in Crimea.
As previously reported, the Ukrainian resident Energodar Eugenia Panov agreed to cooperate with the result.
According to him, he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armenia, the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerchen paramilitary, the gas pipeline, and one of the military airports.
The law enforcement authorities believe that not all disparate parties have been able to hold back.
This, in particular, was the basis for arrest of suspects in the Kyiv court of Simferopol, notes the publication.
Stanislav Čerchesov, head coach of the Russian football assembly
At the meeting, a decision was taken by the Russian Football Union to appoint a major Russian football coach Stanislav Cerchesov.
The contract will be awarded for two years before the end of the CM-2018.
On 11 August, the FFS team appointed as Russia's leading football coach Stanislav Čerchesov.
This is a well-known footballer who has previously played in Moscow's Spartacus in the position of the doorman, as well as a coach with solid experience as a teacher of Russian teams, such as Spartacus, Sochi's Women's, Terek, Amcar, Dinamo, and the Warsaw League, who has become the winner of the national championship and the coup d'état.
It is announced that the contract with the Church will be signed as soon as possible and calculated for two years.
Thus, it is his duty to prepare for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that Miroslav Romaštenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikik will enter his training station.
There is information that the salary of the entire training staff will be EUR 2.6 billion per year.
According to the media, the RFS leadership has set before Stanislav Church's goal to bring Russia together to semifinals and win medals.
As the coach himself stated, he considered the establishment of a competitive environment in the team as a priority and was going to give footballers an opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Churchesov, he was glad that the election had fallen on him.
The first match under the leadership of the Church of Russia will be held in Antalya on 31 August, which will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
In the past, Leonid Słecki, a leading coach at the Russian football club, had taken him to the CSCA.
He expressed his withdrawal from office after the Russian National Command in Euro-2016 in France.
However, he took responsibility for the poor outcome of the gathering.
The greed between Angola and YUAR has greatly affected Namibia during the long fight against apartheid.
However, after the independence of South Africa in 1990, that country, with a population of 2.4 million, has achieved tremendous success, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success was that the Government paid great attention to education.
While people in developed countries see free primary and secondary education as their own, in many poor countries, they require education in secondary and even primary schools.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to introduce training for “cost-sharing”.
However, primary education in Namibia is free of charge.
More than that, since 2015 secondary education has become free.
The country ' s authorities are also active in other important areas.
The efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases of disease by 97 per cent over the past ten years.
In contrast to the international trend of inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared with the 1993 rate of Gini, which is the standard rate of income inequality, 15 points have fallen.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
Poverty decreased from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) has also decreased from nearly 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest rate of freedom of speech in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country has greatly surpassed the United States and other rich States.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the Index of Corruption, which is a human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that commodity prices fall, Namibia is able to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt ratio to GDP is about 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The level of unemployment, at least in traditional methods of assessment, remains sufficiently high, almost 28 per cent.
As with other countries in the region, the high level of HIV/AIDS in Namibia is nearly 17 per cent of the population.
According to the World Bank, Namibia is among the above-average income countries, but the authorities insist that their State is actually a developing country.
Namibia, of course, faces some of the difficulties faced by poorly developed economies.
The State must develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
In the territory of the country, in the desert, isolated horse breeds of hunter-gatherers are living, which must be integrated in modern society, without losing their identity.
The integration of people who had been in the world economy for the past four centuries was a challenge for any country.
It is even more difficult for Namibia: like any other country in the world, it faces the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia did not intend to give up, and the country was addressing its problems.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities were involved in the creation of a diversified economy and a divided society.
It is remarkable that competing political factions have gathered together to work for common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides financial services not only for its own citizens but also for its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of visitors to medical facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia spoke of the construction of a wall that would separate the country from the poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians realized that the neighbours were not elected, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate with the lack of water, to participate in regional health projects, to encourage investment and exchange of students.
In addition, the Government of Namibia has rightly held that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the richness of many.
The authorities understand that Namibia's natural wealth revenues need to be invested in infrastructure and productive capacity.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek the maximum proceeds from the sale of the country's resources, and to review investment laws and procurement contracts to make sure that they do so.
Transparency is crucial to this process, so strong support by the Government for freedom of speech is so important.
As Hage Gaingob's head noted, the media often say that he doesn't like it.
But after fighting freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has received, the President said.
Not all Namibia ' s key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, are renewables, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Each year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that start with serious deficiencies - racism, colonialism, inequality and low levels of development - can get on the way to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the Golden Varna, the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 years before our era).
This was the largest archaeological sensation in the 1970s: in Bulgaria, a fantastic amount of gold artifacts was found in the excavation of Varnen Necropolis, more than three thousand pounds [6 kg].
Only one burial known as Mogila No. 43 was extracted from 990 gold objects of a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world's oldest gold could soon be seen as a bus found by archaeologists in July of this year.
Again, in Bulgaria, in a historical settlement known as the Tel Yunaki.
Unlike Varna, the port city of Tel Yunak is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunak of the Pazardjik region.
Busina is a gold pole turned into a ring.
Javor Bawjiev, the digger at Tele Yunaki, dated 4600 years before our era and stated that she was the oldest of Varna's gold at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna are remembered for about the same period, 4600 to 4200 B.C.E.
There are currently no technologies to accurately date metal.
How, then, can you be sure of what gold is older?
Professor Bajjaev obviously knows more than he told the Reuters agency, "I'm absolutely sure that the gold of the Youths is the gold of Varna."
It's a discovery of extraordinary importance: it's a tiny object, but it's big enough to take a good place in history.
In an interview Reuters Bajajjev reported that scientists were soon studying the composition of the metal, as well as studying again and more carefully the archaeological layer where a gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bus as accurately as possible.
The location also explains a lot.
Young people's body is a famous village even if you've never heard of it.
Tel Yunaci is currently considered the oldest "city" of Europe.
Tel was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) for seven thousand years before our era.
Over the centuries, metal processing in this region has developed rapidly, from the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a fully valued industry.
The family history of this archaeological community has a special title: the Balkan-Carpathian Metallurgical Province.
In the five thousand years before our era around the metal processing centers, urban settlements began to emerge.
They are now called the oldest cities of Europe.
Of them, Tel Eunaki may be the oldest, since the artifacts of the year 4900 were found here before our era.
I would call the Tel Yunaci a prototype of the modern city, although it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This is the older place of Shomera for a thousand years," said Bajujiev, referring to the generally accepted view that urban culture was born in southern Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.
The first cities were created there in the ordinary sense of the word.
The caverns of Tel Aunaci have been in operation since 1976.
During that time, archaeologists dug up almost 12 hectares, about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall were found, which once reached three feet [3 m] in height.
From homes and masters, few remained, but archaeologists made a clear distinction between streets, public buildings, the city’s flats, the “work center” and the residential districts.
The young are often called "The Bird City": dozens of clay figurines were found here.
All birds are represented in a state of peace, from which there was a assumption that they were not decorative objects but a local cult object.
"The Bird City" was destroyed about 4100 years before our era, perhaps by the Indo-European tribes coming from the north-east.
There were no cities of horses, so there were soldiers and guns.
The three-metre walls of the fortress did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found clear signs of brutal warfare: the remains of the elderly, women and children with wounds caused by the beatings were found inside the house.
New findings and new facts appear annually, changing the usual ideas about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking, not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe, born in the Balkans.
The search for this civilization has become a powerful incentive for Varna's gold, found relatively recently, in 1972.
Logically, Varna's golden roses must have been something ahead of them - something like a crooked golden bush set up in Telle Yunaci.
In Porsche artificially old model 911 Targa
It has been officially declared that the preparation of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is conducted by the manual specialists of the department that operate with serial machines.
The "Retro-Luk" is, for example, the special color of Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for Porsche 356B models, and even the logo of the model.
In addition, the market has received a firm white chart along the ships and a special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel drive, as well as some piece design details decorated with "white-gold".
In the retro-character interior, it is smaller: it is largely different from the gray-blue range of the design, the new panels with extended ranges of electrical regulation and the separate black anodized steel with the unit logo.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a gift of chocolate for the car and a well-distributed album with photos of the production process.
The strong installation of Porsche Exclusive has not become an exclusive feature: the retro-tape of the characteristics coincides fully with the series.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbo-density of 3,0 litres, which develops 420 litres and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of 911 Targa 4S is capable of speeding up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued with a limited circulation, but neither its volume nor the value of each specific athlete shall be reported.
Facebook and Ad Blockers Disbanded the “arms race”
The recent implementation of Facebook technology, which prevented advertising from being hidden on the site of the site, has prompted decision makers to block the advertising for response.
In AdBlock Plus, they released a "anti-fouling," but Facebook plans to do it soon and it's useless.
So AdBlock Plus has announced its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
The members of the Society noted that, in an effort to mislead the new "unblocked" advertising technology, the AdBlock Plus decision, along with commercial announcements, also blocks many regular posts from friends or pages.
In Facebook, they expressed regret over such an AdBlock Plus policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
As a source of techCrunch, a code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop will be ready within the next few hours.
Thus, interlockers and blockers have isolated their kind of “arms race”, trying to take care of each other, and the affected party has become users who have missed interesting records from friends or seen advertisements where they have not been used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of the blocking of advertising have recently caused heated disputes.
In Murmanska, the violent man will be brought before the court · Evening Mormansk.
His case had already been investigated in the Russian Federation ' s Labour Committee on the Murman field.
The 54-year-old man charged with sexual assault is very serious.
The result was that at the end of November 2015, the accused in the area of Paulva Street in Murmansk committed sexual acts with violence against 20-year-old girls.
The sentence of that article provides for maximum imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng brings to Russia Crosven Fengguang 370 and Rich New's pickup - ruelem www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a popular representative of the Chinese class of cars that combines the dignity of minivan and crossover.
Another Russian prime minister, Rich New.
Many Western companies, the Moscow International Autosalon, have decided to ignore this year, so the desert of the exhibit halls "Krokus Expo" will be filled by Chinese companies.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation will be a powerful front, with large Russian markets and plans in the near future to offer our car lovers a number of interesting news.
One of these will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 cross-country nationals who sold in China at this spring price of 55,900 yuan (less than 550,000 yuan).
To the Russians, this is hardly a question of supply in our country as yet under discussion.
In China, for example, Fengguang 370, as a result of the June sales, was able to reach 11th in the list of the most sold minivans, although due to the high road education (175 mm) and the protective plastic cover on the lower perimeter of the body, it can be attributed to crossovers.
Crossven is built on a prefabricated Fengguang 360 model, 370 of the same wheel base in 2725 mm, but the pieces can be heard longer (4565 mm against 4510 mm), the design is stronger, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden planks, but the large vertical sensor screen "as at Tesla" on the central console was only on early exhibits of cross-sween, and the machines with "music" were sold easily.
Five of the seven landing sites are easily constructed, forming a level load area of 1650 mm, with a maximum baggage capacity of 1500 l.
The Fengguang 370 engine is equipped with a single, 1.5 litre petrol "atmosphere" power 115 BC, meeting with the 5-stage mechanical transmission box.
The manufacturer has a modest reduction in the dynamic quality of the machine, and he promises the saving budget of the owner an appetite of 6,7 l/100 km.
Pikap Rich New is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navara of the requested generation, but with a comfortable Chinese designer.
In spite of the moral ageing structure, this model has still been used as a stable demand for the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unscrupulous “worker of goods”.
At the same price, Rich New is probably interested in Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become immeasurably expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two elective engines: petrol 2.4 l (137 l.c.) or turbodiesel 2.5 l (116 l.c.).
The transmission box is only a mechanic, the device is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a strictly connected "precious".
It will be on the Dongfeng stand and a new flagman seat A9, his Russian Prime Minister's representation of the Chinese company was announced in June.
The Chinese retail crosswords are growing, one of the latest news - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, Russian director Dongfeng is made up of two models: S30 and H30 Cross.
Seven months later, the Chinese company’s dealers made 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notices will cease to be sent by mail to www.zr.ru
The tax inspection has changed the order for the transmission of property tax notices.
All Russian drivers have been accustomed to a scheme that has not changed in recent years: in summer and autumn, they receive a ticket to pay the transport tax for the previous year.
However, many of them will not be expected this year.
The case is that the tax inspection without noise has changed the order of the citizens ' notification.
Those who are registered in the "Personal Tax Office" on the official website of the log.ru department will be notified in electronic form.
In the inspections, such Russians were automatically considered to be online users and removed from the standard, "paper" transmission.
The news is about all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All others will continue to receive ordinary letters.
On the other hand, it is possible to return to the old scheme and to the account holders on the site.
To this end, they will have to visit the Tax Office in August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more comfortable.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after its completion, when the letter will go for a few days and may be lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet tax inspection service has been exceeded by 18 million, allowing the department to seriously save mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly insufficient to inform citizens of the change in order.
Some could be registered in the "personal office" to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not be expected to be informed by mail and, without doing so, will fall into the category of non-payments with all the consequences.
Access to the "Personal Payer's Office" is made in three ways: by recording the gosuslugi.ru portal, by means of an electronic signature or the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained personally in any tax inspection office (depending on the place of account).
We recall that transport tax should be paid by 1 December this year.
The notification began in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, in which the preparations are aimed at achieving a very high impact, is something in itself.
But the controversial concept did not disturb G-Power's masters who took over the modification of Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its passion for BMW cars, but nothing human to her masters is foreign.
In fact, why not improve G 63 - 571-strong flight deck with an aerodynamic tank and a discharge up to a hundred in 5.4 c?
With the "muscules" of the falsified "gelic", the master took advantage of the advantages that opened up a 5,5 litres of an eight-litre breath.
And that's how it's going down to a hundred, it's going to get better at the indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "kirpic" is capable of a 5.3 s.
On the other hand, the speed of the average is likely to be much better for him.
The speed ratio is alarming: if standard G 63 does not drive 210 km/h, the tunnel all-way with an off-line electronic "fisher" is capable of surviving 250 km/h.
