Inflation in Europe jumped for food
The rapid inflation target in the euro area is due, in particular, to the steady rise in food prices.
The November price growth in 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, with 2.6 per cent in October recorded annual inflation 3.1 per cent, the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union announced.
The official forecast was only three percent, and Bloomberg announced.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian emission banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the basic interest rate by reducing together with rising raw materials prices and reducing unemployment by creating inflationary spirals.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below two percent, however close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: inflation must be "adjusted" so that it does not have to do anything later on in this matter.
In Germany, November inflation represents 3.3 per cent of the 15-year record; then in Spain it rose from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has exploded because of fast rising food and energy prices.
The term wheat prices rose by 88 per cent, and the soybean price has also reached the highest values since 1973.
In 2007, however, it was necessary to pay substantially more for oil and milk products.
The price of oil on world markets this year rose by 52 per cent, and last month, one barrel of black gold has already become nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will increase in 2008 from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate will continue to remain at approximately 3 per cent in the following 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The Fidesz movement has grown significantly since the beginning of December, and has now been the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Gallup Institute's Socialists, the 13% support has never been targeted yet.
In the case of certain parties' wishes, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition's wishes - would be more than two-thirds (71%) support against the MSP's fifth support.
The MDFs and the SZDSZ are based on a study on the threshold for Parliament's accession: their support for the entire population is two percent.
Among certain voters of the party are the beneficiaries of both camps by one percent more.
The public's view of the economy has also worsened in view of the previous minimum - it has never been the ratio of those who consider the country's economic situation to be very poor, so high - 41 per cent, while the other 46 per cent consider the situation to be quite bad.
The family's assessment of the change in its material situation after the spring and summer hopeful prospects is now more pessimistic.
With regard to the next year, it counts most of the population with further deterioration and only tens with improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, most of all of Gallup's studies today, judged that the prime minister is doing his work worse than well.
Ference Gyurcsány believes or very believes 13 percent of the respondents, while Victor Orbán shares 38 percent of the beneficiaries.
The Prime Minister doesn't even believe 54 percent, the President of the Fides movement 27 percent.
One of the indicators of political development is how much of the public believes that discontent with the prime minister can be resolved without changes in the government.
While after last October's disturbances, the government and the prime minister were considered as demanding 35 per cent, at present this share is only 20 per cent, with a relative majority (33 per cent) looking at the solution only in writing new elections.
In the interest of the referendum, 60 per cent of respondents replied to the question of their possible participation, that it would certainly come and another 20 per cent said it would probably come.
For comparison, "Parliamentary elections scheduled this week" would certainly be attended only 55 per cent and another 15 per cent considered their participation as likely. The success of the referendum would be beyond doubt on the basis of current intentions.
The school would say no 74, the fees for doctors 79 and the hospital stays 84 percent.
If we look at the same proportions only in the circle of people who certainly promise their participation, then the introduction of school fees, medical fees and hospital stay fees would be 81, 84, and 89 percent.
The dearest is Auchan, almost five times Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Buddhist triangular trade had been maintained last year, an average of 16% of the price level, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article of the journal Napi Masterság
The usual Christmas consumer basket of Napi Myrság's journal in the Budaur shopping triangle this year has grown by 16 percent, but in all hypermarkets, there has been a significant increase in the price over thousands of forints.
Since food prices in supermarkets "flighted" already fell in December, as a percentage of the previous high base did not appear to be so drastic.
However, for the consumer, it is certainly unsatisfying that what they might have been willing to buy at a price below nine thousand forints will not be able to order even ten thousand now.
The consumer basket of the daily economy in the hypermarkets examined exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints of at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 there was a consumption basket of 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and the living fish remained almost at the last level, although the cruel breasts, nuts, and also worms were greatly affected.
The prices of bread and milk corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although we found in Auchan a kilogram of bread for 139 forints.
The competition didn't go with the price of the product under 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of two litres of Coca Coly in the neck bottle was below 200 forints, so only 257 forints were made in stock.
However, this year, according to the consumption basket, Napi Masterság Auchan appeared as the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our polls, prices in Napi Masterság's daily consumer basket for Christmas Cora prices rose by 15, while Tesco and Auchan were about 18 percent.
When comparing the last highest and this year's lowest value of the basket, the difference was 12 per cent, while the increase between the lowest and the last one is 21 per cent.
There was an increase of 1,480 in the unit.
The average increase in the price of the hair was 1,206 forints, with prices being affected by the rise in VAT.
It is precisely this process that has disrupted the trade, and the trade houses have clearly failed to decide how large price ranges are to be determined in individual products as they have not been able to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of the turnover of the product concerned incorrectly, the price range may result in significant profits due to the adjusted intensity of the turnover.)
Due to the VAT, the rise in the price of Napi Masterság's daily consumer basket showed so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest made the price difference of 844 forints worldwide.
This year the final difference did not appear, the most expensive basket now stood by 1,630 forints more than the elephants and also the cheapest of 1,284 forints.
In comparison with the two Christmas season, there has been a dramatic rise in prices, and in less than 20 months, daily consumption in hypermarkets has been sought by more than 30 per cent.
(In addition, it does not fully confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office: in the case of a number of basic foods, an increase of more than 30 per cent over 12 months.
Other than milk, for example, in the case of eggs.)
However, in the latter case, according to the consumption basket of the Daily Economy, it seems almost impossible because the price level of the product, quite expensive already in the last year, has proved to be the basis even in the worst case of price growth of almost 10 per cent.
The suppliers of the flours take a stronger position than the egg suppliers, and the drastic increase in prices has also been found in international chains.
Hypermarkets in a golden triangle do not complain, they still refer to a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in the three visited shops are no longer interested in the price.
They buy everything, they buy the cash, they get the food on the payroll.
On Wednesday morning, long fronts were created in all three supermarkets, as the number of visitors grew rapidly.
However, as we know, there is a lower trend on the outside, many international networks are complaining to research firms that markets are lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food but also in the case of sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, there are disinfectants.
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection have been reported in hospitals mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The health conditions of the patients, the filling of the beds, the burden of staff stopping the infection do not help, the prime minister of the National Epidemiological Centre.
In many places, there are also disinfectants.
A recent diagnosis of MRSA infection was made at the traumatological department of St. John's Hospital.
Bacteria resistant to antibiotics were found in a man who was hospitalized after a serious transport accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
A patient injured in a serious car accident was released at home, however, shortly after he had to return with MRSA infection and because of the bacteria in his body still could not be performed an important operation.
By December 10th, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant disease had been reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance, told Karolina Böröčová, head of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant diseases have been registered in hospitals with certainty, others do not know.
Nearly two thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacilin with a resistant golden staphylococcal.
Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) carries a third of the people in the body without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. breast-feeding, meningitis, skin infections, infected infections) respond well to antibiotics and are treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered to an excess or inappropriate extent, the bacteria will develop well-responsive bacteria, which are very resistant to antibiotics and which are rapidly expanding under inadequate hospital conditions.
In particular, in the case of transient or persistent failure of the immune system in patients with weak body, low body weight or in patients over the years, serious hospital infections, such as damaged infection or blood poisoning - sepsis may occur.
According to the physician of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infection in patients with daily practice.
"The infection must not be replaced by an epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the cause of the disease is not examined."
Depends on antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the curing staff treats them in rubber gloves and in masks and for their treatment we need antibiotics," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital have been examined in advance whether MRSA is present in their body, nor can the infection always be avoided.
Selection is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, however, the current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not for the prevention of the emergence and spread of multi-resistant causes of disease, says Karolina Böröčová.
As this infection occurs markedly in hospitals and seniors, patients treated should be monitored and the MRSA carriers should be immediately isolated.
However, the selection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not fashionable.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance this investigation.
Most of the cases are revealed if the patient suffers from a preventable MRSA infection, the primary epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strong recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
It is necessary to strive for the target of antibiotic therapy, or a microbiological examination should be carried out to prevent resistance to medicines, however, not to be observed in all cases.
Microbiological samples have been reported more frequently in primary and ambulatory patients, Karolina Böröčová.
He's looking at disinfectants.
According to scientific evidence, MRSA spreads among patients most frequently through healthcare.
Therefore, the role of hand-washing and use of gloves and masks is very important, but serious deficiencies occur in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted with capella infection and touch, but under the conditions of home patients, it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close to themselves, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 metres away.
As Karolina Böröczová pointed out, unfortunately, we can also meet with the fact that in patients who are in an adverse material situation, they are on disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients, which are still increasing the chance of infection.
According to Karolina Böröčová, the necessary protective measures, similar to infections, are observed to be significantly less or further spread of the cause of the disease can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of the MRSA infection is a huge expenditure for health insurance, which is why it is fought everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has written down the MRSA prevention programme and reduced its appearance.
The program seems to be successful, according to the published data, shows a downward trend of MRSA infection in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is responsible for the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant origins (including MRSA) and for the respective hospital infections caused by these origins, among their priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk
The official record statement in the case of the police captain of the XXII district, which caused a fatal accident, is ready.
It may be excluded that police captain XXII. of the district, which killed a walker on Tuesday and who, in the meantime, withdrew from his office, led under the influence of alcohol or congenital substances, would inform the speaker of Attila Morvai's Chief State Representative on Friday after a thorough review of this case was completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the outcome of the original investigation, which has already been found to be that the former police captain did not drink any alcohol before he was seated as a wheelman.
The then head of the 21st District Police Directorate hit Lajose Kossuth on Tuesday in the 21st District of Lajose Kossuth on his own personal car in the direction of a 15-year-old man who entered before him when crossing the vehicle outside the designated crossing.
(The last known fact that the walker has crossed beyond the zebra, the rest, according to road traffic rules, is not an easy circumstance, the turning car must also be given priority.)
After transporting to the hospital, the walker died.
As a result of this incident, the District Police Director withdrew from the office and requested a transfer to the service, according to the police, because the case was so upset.
The case is conducted by an investigation by the Budapest State Investigation Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been working with state investigators from the beginning.
Other EUR 400 million in infrastructure
The agreement on the three credit frameworks totaling EUR 400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy were signed by the Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajeck, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Friday.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved the financing of projects in the transport and environment sector implemented by the Cohesion Fund, a framework of EUR 300 million, which the parties had previously concluded a credit agreement of EUR 100 million, the now signed agreement concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A loan agreement of EUR 150 million is also used to finance projects linked to education.
The EIB has approved for Hungary a total of EUR 300 million for these purposes, with the use of the remaining EUR 150 million later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed the contract for 50m euros, which will use the budget primarily for the research-development project of the Debrecen University.
The conversation was also about the 4th metro route.
The parties agreed that once Hungary agrees with the EU on the details of the financing of the meter, it will return to whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to János Verese, this may occur in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of EUR 8.4 billion for 113 projects.
The amount of loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment commission is linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is a reality paradise in the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of the whole of Europe is being turned to a somewhat isolated Balkan country.
What, where and who are buying the most cheap, yet fast with the damaging EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
The most sought-after Eastern European property purchase goal is now the doubt of Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the seashore.
From the mountains are the most in the course of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, then on the seashore Albena, Golden Sands, Sun Coast, ancient cities Sozopol and Nesebar, however more people are also looking for properties around Kavarny and Balčik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, the interest of investors and the central part of the country - for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and still more of the stakeholders - is also buying in the vicinity of the exhibition of the cheap city of Russia.
The capital of Sofia is also a facilitator of opportunities, commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to turn into one of the most attractive golf regions of Europe, and thus to be near the summer and winter season sought for the purpose of the trip even in the next two years.
Forecast investors are already buying in big, for example in the area of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their life and lifestyle at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but customers from France, Belgium, Spain, and more often from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors here, at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts, there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The sinking people buy either renovated properties worth between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or buried old houses for between 5 and 15 thousand euros, which then renovate.
They require good access and communication opportunities, which are important to them near the big city, shops and local doctor’s corrections.
The second category is the buyers of chat (Bulharsko was ranked among the first 10 German recreational goals in December).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who are buying in hopes of a rise in value in the medium- or long-term horizon.
The city's real estate is unstoppable, because demand is as strong as possible.
In Bulgaria, however, the lowest prices of reality in the European Union have grown by 21 per cent each year in the last five years.
The increase in real estate prices is significantly higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and six percent of Hungary
According to the Minister for the Environment and the Water Industry of Gábor Fodor, the meeting of experts will be completed on Tuesday and the international conference on the climate regime will continue to be held by ministers after the mid-term official start of 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are talking about the Bali Roadmap, which will resolve the efforts following the reduction of emissions by the Kyoto Protocol in force by 2012.
At this point, there is a heated debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that they are not going to deal with precise numbers now, although they are going to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 per cent by 2020 in view of the 1990 situation.
The next major question of the conference is whether the developed countries will join in addition to reducing emissions also to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that are dedicated to it.
The agreement was also born on grants for developing countries.
The grant fund, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, will be run by the 16-member management board, probably within the framework of the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the UN - we can read in Piac es Profit.
Six percent of Hungary
The Minister for the Environment and the Water Industry, Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leadership in efforts to achieve global climate protection and to assist in the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 against 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the adoption of the "agreements after 2012", and is ready to commit to a 30% reduction in the case that other mature countries will also be willing to accept the responsibility and commitments that they have.
Gabor Fódor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had reached the target of a 5.2 per cent reduction, and that the EU 15 Member States had then committed 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent against the 1985-87 years, which will be fulfilled by our government. - The press report of the Ministry of the Environment.
The Bali is a lot, because within two years it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policies, otherwise its entry into force with certainty would have moved up to 2012. In such a case, the commitment to the reduction set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately affect the new emission reduction system, whose need in its latest report was also indicated by the UN International Scientific Assembly dealing with climate change - IPCC, which is the holder of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would result in a slowdown of emissions and an inevitable increase in average temperatures on Earth of more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army on YouTube · Global Voices
British military units publish videos from events in Iraq and Afghanistan on the server to share videos, which they promote themselves.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has liked YouTube: special units operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos from actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
The recordings, equipped with a miniature camera attached to the access, are controlled by the Air Force Commanding Operation in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are transferred to the internet.
Political message is inevitable
This form has already received 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers on the Internet, and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Defence Ministry registered in spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonweight Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Set-up in Afghanistan
Air forces have published the videos in accordance with their original intention for the recruitment and the Ministry of Defence is also good at getting to know the general public for the real purpose of the presence of the army abroad.
"The propaganda published in this form against traditional television broadcasts is hardly worth anything," the BBC expert on the defence of Gordon Mackenzie said, "but it is also necessary to carry a certain political message in it, because the special form confirms the validity of the military actions that the government has decided to do."
The Americans made the game
The army is concerned that alongside carefully adjusted, censored recordings on the server also receive amateur videos, including the death of soldiers: in some covert, "official" promotional films, the officers at least talk about losses, but there is no bloody image of the battle.
There have been many videos on the Internet from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, which was created during a severe set-up, yet the British army has come to them so far.
Americans perform the set a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which a player can get by means of more faithful simulation directly into the skin of soldiers.
There will be Christmas in the ministries with a tombol and pagillas
The ministry of work Monika Lamperth is obviously not sentimental: the place of the holiday party will organize for its employees a final working meeting to which the Pagans and coffee will be disbursed with 2007.
In some ministries, there will be a celebration with live music, and elsewhere it will excite officials with the Christmas atmosphere with tombol and spices.
Dinner, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and Swedish table - it's so fun.
State authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive Christmas celebration this year will be organised by the Ministry of Defence, but it does not expect its employees.
About Christmas orphans will receive gifts for the children of the fallen soldiers, while at Mission Christmas they will host family members of soldiers serving at the moment on foreign missions, but also arrange receptions for journalists.
The resort is dedicated to the atmosphere of the end of 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) will issue a copy to other resorts.
The GKM dinner is held in the centre of Jöv tongue, a total of 4,320,000 forints and of the six seven ministerial staff, approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will stick to its holiday tradition, but it will also come to various performances and will also drop the tombol.
The night of the NFÜ was 4,700,000 forints and held on Wednesday in the State Judicial Council (OIT) building - concerts and dinners were on the program.
The rent of the hall stood a million forints, the rest was set up for more than four guests.
It seems that one of the NFÜ's departments is invited to another Christmas celebration: there is a company providing the course of trends, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
To this end, they rented a theater building in Vigshinhaz.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG since it has not been able to reach the person concerned.
Clothing is not necessary
The construction of the ILO was not only hosted by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which organized the 7th December of St. Lucie's dance.
However, OIT did not want money from him for the use of his halls.
Five hundred people attended the dance.
The evening began by the Minister of Health, after dinner it was possible to dance for the follow-up of live music.
According to the answer to the portal question [origo] to the dance, there were no compulsory evening dress or dress at all.
The Puritan party is taking care of health resorts, work and local self-government.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and a celebration for employees for 400 000 forints in their own building.
The Ministry of Labour Monika Lamperth's collaborators are not even officially calling for a Christmas party, but at the final working meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests, who, according to the press department, will only get coffee and cookies, so only 350,000 forints will be available to the parties.
Minister for Local Authorities Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply join the Ministry of Local Authorities and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas meeting, where 436 employees are expected to be in their own large hall.
On the Christmas party, it devotes 2,500 forints to the guest - the total includes reception with Swedish tables and dishes.
Since the time that Minister János Veres has been, PM workers celebrate Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be lacking, officiality will strengthen not only the ministerial speech, but also the afternoon of the ceremony.
The farm resort is scheduled for the 20th of January's New Year's reception, the ministerial holidays are not known.
The reception will be held in the city of Vajdahunyadvár in the City Fruits and, according to the Ministry's announcement, 1,000 forints per person are for a hundred guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception inviting only relevant foreign diplomat accreditation in Hungary.
These annual receptions start as a short medical minister and end up being a little bit of a guest.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not organise the Christmas parties at all, has informed the [orig] relevant press department.
The price of the holiday festival of the environmental resort in the press department was not able to be communicated.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party at the Museum of Art.
He's headed for the giant station.
The Association of Associations of Associations of Committees of the League, and the respective National Association of Labour Councils (MOSZ) will establish their position committee on the coordination of Monday's open-ended positions on Friday.
On Saturday, a protest public meeting will be held, on Monday - on the day of final vote on the health insurance law - will be stopped.
The action will certainly cause a serious interruption of transport, as rail transport will be almost completely stopped and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be posted within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the meeting of the Association of the League together with the General Association of Working Councils with the details of the joint organised Monday's events.
The LIGA-MOSZ stand-by committee will also be set up, which will coordinate Monday's actions.
On Saturday, there is a protest public meeting, then Monday, a committee joining the camp will stop work for a period of uncertainty, if no agreement with the government is reached.
This means that the deadline was not set for the end of the sentence, which begins on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not finally adopt the Health Insurance Act, the committees will immediately withdraw the call for action.
However, if the legislation is repealed, the intervention committee shall be consulted and shall decide on another procedure.
According to the Monday part-session of Parliament, it is also possible to vote on the Health Insurance Act until late evenings, if any, at night.
As a result of the start-up on Monday, it is possible to count with serious interruptions of transport: work on the railway will be stopped for an indefinite period, one can stop in the afternoon part of the construction community and more than half of the company Volán.
At the same time, there are many places in the country also to close half of the road.
A number of committees and civil organisations, whose list is constantly updated on the sides of the League, have joined the conference.
Some organizations have been adjourned for an indefinite period of time, others have issued a temporary suspension of work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railway (MÁV) and the Independent Railway Staff Association (VDSZZZ) had not been able to agree on adequate services, while at the beginning of the Christmas holidays they travel on the railway as many as possible.
According to today's announcements, from the beginning of the operation up to 13 hours in BKV, from 7 to 9 hours in the morning at Budapest Airport, the Committee's working associations in the energy industry of the LIGA, to a 2-, 2-8-hour stop, respectively, called for the Committee's Pedagogical Association and the Democratic Committee's Pedagogical Association.
The association of Hungarian doctors will be held throughout the country, the Democratic Committee for Health and Social Affairs (EDDSZ), which is part of the Cooperation Forum for the Committee for Trade Unions (SZEF), will organise a two-hour surveillance event.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League is that the government withdraw the proposal for a health insurance reform and submit a new concept to the public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating the income is gradually introduced from next year.
Third, to ensure that early retirement for the relevant working groups is eligible for inclusion in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Railway Workers' Association (VDSZZZ), which is a member of the Liga Association, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economics and Transport concerning railway lines, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian guard increased the country's risk
The work of the Hungarian Guard, based on support for the movement of Jobbik Magyarországért in August of this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute, has now increased in several aspects of Hungary's political risk and the whole area.
The "risk warning" developed by the company says: in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "by focusing on the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and the non-Romanian population of Hungary, it can already come to violent ethnic shocks in a short time."
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to focus on the launch of such an action - it is being delivered by the research institute.
As it is written, all of this can be explained by one of the greatest disadvantages of Hungarian political representatives: "The public debate on the Roma issue has left public life representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could put a political strategy at their disposal in the Roma-Madar conflict."
This problem deepens, disables normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - a judicial institution.
In addition, according to the Research Institute, the Hungarian Guard's activity has had a major impact on domestic and foreign media "to a significant extent shown the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to faith in the stability of the country and its democratic achievement".
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and ultra-reform groups, which has been gaining ever greater publicity and vehhemence since the fall of 2006, is that since 2007 in Hungary, several organisations have been created, which themselves are known as "national Home Affairs" companies.
"The common image of these groups is that they themselves define themselves as a civil society, while they openly declare, even armed, their members' willingness to carry out defence tasks (in the case of life disasters, attacks by the authorities, violations of order), in addition with an indication of the inability of the police, the army, or the state," he adds.
It further notes that all of this is being done in a way that seeks to cover the most diverse political efforts made to resist society's political and civil interests.
The emphasis on civilisation and the form of society in the case of these groupings is therefore not only due to the rule of law of procedure, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the Hungarian Guard’s activity is also a risk factor for neighbouring relations.
"In recent months they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, ultra-nationalist political representatives of some neighbouring countries have been calling for the rise of the Hungarian Guard to apologize for their own anti-Material policy.
All of this can have an impact on the political stability of the area," he adds.
According to the Research Institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a single phenomenon, so the political risk for the region as a whole has increased.
As it says, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, for example, are similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation announced in August 2007 the ultra-reform Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
In the background of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Roman nuisances that exploded in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used to set up a guard with the aim of the organization being "national home defence".
In the past 17 years, according to it, there has been "cicanic terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained ineffective and fragile, the Institute of Political Capital recalls.
It adds that the initiative triggered a stormy debate among the Bulgarian public.
As it goes on to say, the increase in the risk of ethnic violence signals the announcement of some Bulgarian Roma organisations that they create their own guard on the mark of resistance.
Since the current activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that even the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own home defence, we can read in the warning of the risk created by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhász, research director of the Institute of Political Capital, pointed out the question of the press office: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, risk analysis is issued every year and if it finds something that might have an impact on risk change, they inform public opinion, such as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Celebrations are not everywhere free
In Hungary, the days of freedom are precisely defined by law, and it has become a general practice to move around the holidays, which awaits us less than once in the next year.
In the European Union and in America, celebrations are not united.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and working days.
Workdays of peace with most weigh on church holidays or on significant historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is the job vacancy - for the New Year already to allow people to rest after Silvestro.
During the year, we have a total of eleven free holidays.
The national celebration is March 15th, celebrating the 1848 and October 23rd revolution, a memorial day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20th, we celebrate the establishment of the state, May 1st, and November 1st and November 2nd, we remember dead relatives and friends.
Besides, we have the two-day Easter, Summer and Christmas celebrations.
Since our national, national, or religious celebrations are rarely on the agenda, the practice of moving a working day has become a practice in cases that we would work only one day before or after a free holiday.
The price for the extended weekends, however, is that we are staying at the workplace and at school the previous Saturdays.
The day that the celebration immediately precedes or follows, we have been working out, for years, he has been adjusting in his special statement by the Minister of Labour.
The law shall apply equally to all employees and their employees, to public employees and to persons in public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions which are in operation without interruption or having regard to their purposes, even in working days.
This year's change in the working order is only around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24th, life in the country will be almost stopped, because according to the experience of today's people, most days between Christmas and Silvester before "working" or using the preserved holiday.
In the next year, a few of our holidays fall in the middle of the week, respectively at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
First, the calendar will be changed around the holiday to allow workers to stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that it can be on Friday, May 2nd.
Another move relates to the celebration of October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, it will be working on Friday 24.
At the end of the year, however, it will be able to take place completely in the symbol of the celebrations, since December 24th they will have almost everywhere in the holiday, and even though Silvester is on Wednesday.
Six scary little things that can upset your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send out, voice messages that we never get, innocent lies that we don't even notice: it's all "screaming" every day at work.
The question is whether you will get used to these minor inconveniences, or you will put on gloves and unclear situations that others may upset, you will deliberately avoid.
Guys.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," your colleague will tell you.
That's why you've lost your mind?
In the best case, he's sorry and will try to fix it, he'll call the marketing department, and he'll say he forgot to deliver the message (this is a less common solution).
The most common thing is solved once apologise.
Before it comes to a shameful apology, it is good to think about what you can do to prepare your colleagues for the unpleasant moments, and wisely try to avoid it.
Are you borrowing something that's not yours?
It's nothing more unpleasant than getting used to some writing, office needs or their phone, and they're not there.
Remember, you put yourself on the table yesterday, but it's gone in the morning?
Or have you discovered your pen on the table of any of your colleagues who you thought were lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without your permission, otherwise they'll be right to be angry that you're going to bury them in things.
Do not take cover or adhesive paper from your office because it may be unpleasant when you get there early, and you will need it immediately.
Murders about the private life of colleagues?
There's no good solution to stop the spread of the cages.
Who, who, what was he doing with?
Where and why?
Don't let anyone know your news about the private life of your colleagues!
If one of them shares his inner secret with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock in what you have heard, and do not go through with your colleagues in his absence, even when others know about him.
No reason to report your absence?
If you call in the office and with a call for strong headaches, you report your absence because it's not good for you, or you say that you would prefer to rest today, you think that your work, undeserved tasks and work that have a certain time will have to do for you someone else.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to work, or that something might happen that makes you have to stay at home, let your colleagues and leaders not be confronted with your absence until the next day.
Pollution, hygienicity, telephone call
Are you ashamed of the work of which the wrath of your colleagues is to drive you out?
Were you reluctant to witness a telephone conversation that would be better not to hear at all?
Do not interrupt your associates by using consumption, singing, loud calls (over their heads), or by squeezing, constant swearing, loud dissatisfaction.
All of this can be disruptive even when they're not just banned from a project (writing, planning, organization).
You're blaming for the other's mistakes?
If there is something on time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame the other for your forgetfulness!
Do not respond to any chaos in the office and in the sounding colleagues!
Admit it if you're wrong and someone paid for it and fix the damage!
Ask yourself how you can put things right, fix your anxiety!
Do you feel at the office too much at home?
Heats and shoes: comfortable clothing at home, though not suitable for the office!
Don't take your clothes off for free time, even if it allows your profession!
Don't be rude, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in regular dress - and if your profession requires it, it's nice and elegant!
When a person wants to make a success of it, he stops being interesting
A ride in the usual morning jam.
The radio will answer the special melodies: the sound of noise, to which electronic effects are connected.
I'm adding the volume.
Music changes pace and the previous tone color is added bass, then the women’s congregation is added as a true curse.
At station mr2 is the composition of the Zagar group called Wings of Love.
The home music life didn't take us long enough with a quality e-pop.
Suddenly, though, the tape looks quite different because you're just listening to the new Zagara album.
The appearance of Yonderboie, a few new and interesting productions from the home digital underground, the overall picture slowly changes, and although it is again in the fashion of garage rock with its milking into the guitar, and the domestic electropop proves that it is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Peticostel, and he also played in Yonderbo's band, when it finally ended - perhaps because two dudes don't go to one card - he left his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music, which connects the elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to browse until he was invited to compose film tracks (e.g.
film Ference Töreka "Szezon").
His formations, at the beginnings of smaller clubs, met the wider audience after the magazine van2 classified their first album from 2002 among the 50 most important home desks and told Zagar in Yonderboie about the only domestic actors that could be sold in the West as well.
Zagar and his hats are undoubtedly "in the course", although of course no one asked if they were satisfied with this sticker.
The chapel reacted as it did: it made a new, better album.
Now released album called Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths, although the same name is trying to create a bond with the initial summers in Petikostel.
This is a single verse from the composition of the darkest old chapels of Balázse Zságera.
The reference to etheric, flying would be in place, but beside the etheric breath of this music now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, the trend of time - the louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs the singer György Ligeti, who currently works in England with the group The Puzzle, was represented at the premiere of the board in the Millenáris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station Mr.2 Pet¿fi, playing the last time from morning to evening popular music, we started to sing the various melodies of Wings of Love, fed with six home singers ("underground Divas").
So it's all right (?).
The portal Hvg.hu told Balázsa Zságer.
hvg.hu: In relation to this new hit, the question is offered, how much remains what you play, district music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of border music does not mean much to me.
I think there are two different sets of easy music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and that's just how it can come out for sales, which makes it commercial.
However, a good pop-up composition can come from an honest internal need.
This spirit also acts as accepted, regardless of language and state boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: In a foreign country, especially from us to the west, has a light music of greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people in 20s, but also older ones.
Much more is being followed by changes in light music going around them, because they also consider it part of a contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter to you who, where, and how much your music is listening to?
B. Zs.: Of course, it's a good feeling that our concerts go as far as possible.
But we never made music for the market.
We don't have music with purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public can be taken rather to concerts where the interaction is already functioning, but it is hidden only in non-negotiable changes at the moment.
Still, I noticed that if a person wants to make a public, from that moment on, he's stopped being interesting.
hvg.hu: How many are you going to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He works alone, and he's built his career from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We're not actually going his way, regardless of how our music sometimes tries to explain.
We're more team players who rely on the other's musical presence and let it develop.
At first, of course, it did not prevent our work from being compared to the Yonderboi compositions, but several of us separated from his chapel and went on a different path.
hvg.hu: In the heat station mr2 Pet′′fi the composition of Wings of Love was first obtained.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in relation to this composition.
The more popular style you have, you know, opened with a wider layer?
B.Zs.: We shouldn't have planned to write a hit to sell the board.
It's more about that song.
We imagined it as a final album that we tried to relax the previous sound organ and more complex topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose those six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel congregation.
Then came the idea to make this collection of soloists home music scenes with a good voice.
So this six - year - old congregation - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikˈ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth - was put together, which we then crossed into the Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: That's exactly what you meant by the song, or did girls make up something about it?
B.Zs.: The building has been in the instrumental version for a long time, when the material came to the board, we said that there would be something else needed for this collection.
After the accords, he agreed to join him in the song.
On the other night, I sang to him a song that girls later learned.
The whole thing went out almost the first and the most spontaneous.
I remember how it came back to life, but of course, it took Divy.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that energetically.
hvg.hu: As on the desktop, the concert seemed to be girls in the background.
They don't have solos (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own roles, they sing totally together, and they're not louder than music, so music doesn't just support their songs.
They also stood in the back of the van.
Is that intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they stood in the back was just because of technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to split up the solo role is the opposite of what's going on.
And that composition is that we forget a little bit about our ego, where is he, where he belongs, and let us just let those wings rise, the wings of love.
I wanted this euphoric state that we felt when that song was born, to feel the others.
Hvg.hu: What was the most work with?
B.Zs.: During the composition of the music, even with one, the harder pieces occurred rather when mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he long refused to work the grooves, then everything slowly found its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which composition of the new board is your favorite?
B.Zs.: This is still changing by the concert, and I've already released the board.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A traitor risked billions of minorities
It's a fake defalant.
This is what Jeroma Kerviel, a French banker giant Société Générale, owns the German Commercial Bank.
He's got a five billion-euro silence on him.
But instead, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to balance himself with his colleagues, and he certainly couldn't.
In contrast to all large banking homes, the US mortgage market crisis has suddenly spread.
"It's spiritually weaker," said his superiors, who sent him to the police.
But as it comes from Kerviel's statement by the French media, such as Le Monde's journal, it was the person who had a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year's trades.
Crisis Not Just in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in a statement.
In summer, he managed to make half a billion euros in the US crisis.
The opportunity had already been felt by the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that so-called sub-prime mortgages provided to low-copy customers or those who had problems with payment in the past would have problems.
This crisis has not had an impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and put it right.
At the end of the year, his profit dropped to 1.6 billion euros.
"Now that I made the first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly didn't leave anything for himself.
In the entire investigation, he admitted that he faked the records so that they wouldn't come to him.
He even managed to send the boss, even though he was beginning to be interested in his business.
The risk was profit
He was afraid he'd come to him?
Not anymore.
"I thought the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy it."
Where did he take so much risk?
He had to work on his position gradually.
He joined the General Society in 2000 just after he graduated from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 he became a single broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never make as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I knew they were paying for me.
For my education and also for professional and personal development," Kerviel described to investigators.
But soon after the show, the first big success came.
With Allianz's action, he made it, in the bombings on London, to the fall of this title, half a billion euros.
And it was a trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make, we'll leave you.
"It's like a snowball," he told the cops.
But the bosses knew all about it, or they knew it.
"When I made the money, they closed their eyes."
But then the morning came at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to see it.
When he came to work Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And the bank reported a couple of days later that it was worth five billion euros.
And how did they get to him?
He became a suspect for his vacation.
"I've only been out for four days in the last year.
A broker who doesn't have a vacation is a broker who doesn't want anyone to look into his records," Kerviel closed.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech Government's representatives signed a total of nine operational programmes, from which the Czech Republic can receive EUR 14 billion (approximately SEK 365 billion) in the coming years.
It is about half the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns will come from seven operational programmes in the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation programme.
The biggest money, up to 150 billion, is going to be heading for transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the funds available from the PRC.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be owned by 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Business and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and firms to obtain funding for innovation.
Companies should receive funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
In today's spending of money from EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the least successful in the newly adopted countries.
Twenty-year sentence for the representative of Nicaragua confirmed the court
The Court of Appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday a 20-year penalty for the former president of the country of Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (a total of 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a house in prison on his glove near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
If the head of this Central American State from 1997 to 2002 returns back behind the grid, it is not clear according to the AP agency at this time.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileany Pérezov will now be responsible for the prison officials, whether they let the Germans serve his sentence at home or travel to prison.
Four years ago, the Court proved to Germany that it regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the account actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of these money then ended up in the fund that Germany founded on financing its election campaign in 2001.
So we were approved by the budget.
That's right.
The State budget was adopted.
What is this budget exceptional for?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without support for the opposition.
This year, he went through with the support of the ČSSD because he was prepared by the Minister of Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford to accept it.
Unlike the Russian debate before the vote on mistrust, the government has done nothing dramatic this time.
This traditionally overlooked, even the most influential, sneezing of the law has been passed in peace.
It's a paradox.
Each administration starts and ends with each chapter and budget item, whether someone likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is a secret to the powerful opposition of the government.
This is more grateful to the media and is why it pays much more attention to it.
Policy-making is much more interesting for the public than hard numbers.
State budgets in the past socially democratic governments have suffered from three insanity which is not able to resolve at once for 2008:
The first is a high share of the law of compulsory, so-called mandate expenditures, which are not only pensions, but also social contributions, which were approved by the silent "coalic" ČSSD and KSČM last year before the elections.
The second of them is the lack of economics as a result of the insanity of the first.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of city and municipality budgets.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the State budget.
This one's public and relatively under control.
However, the time-bombing deficit is the budget deficit of cities and villages.
Many worry that, in addition to money from taxes, fees and loans from the bank, other sources of investment often issue bonds that were unduly owed to their advisers.
In the past years, they have been able to pay these debts for the mass sales of energy and other distribution networks from the state of privatization.
They don't have this source anymore.
If we just stick to official and verifiable facts, we'll find that:
Our economy has been going on for several years, as well as the rest of the world, a growing phase, which keeps ČSSD in its grip.
It was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, the state still owed more.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have hosted much more than our republic.
It's a huge shame that falls primarily on the previous government.
We are among the countries that are at least at global level threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have gone beyond the size of the giants in recent years.
Even if some foolish populist expenditures, approved this year before the elections, were to be abolished, if the threshold for retirement and pension reform is not reached in the near future, then any policy in this country will actually be put to an end and any government will only be able to do so.
With little emphasis it can be said that government policies will become officials, mechanically disbursing most of the money spent on pensions and social contributions.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the execution of normal expenditure by mandates.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be totally negligible if the previous governments did not manage over the past ten years as much as they could.
If we do not really want it to happen that only government policies will become officials, then we must be patient and encourage this rather strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can get on taxes and charges, to prepare for further reform laws.
Only those will allow for the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Britain, Switzerland and Canada decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
In the monetary market, there will be more than a hundred billion dollars through auctions.
In these auction banks, interest rates tend to be high, and they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $400 billion to auction, and the next $440 will be available to the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is after the attacks of the eleventh September, first, that the central banks of individual states agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step is intended to solve the biggest economic difficulties, which is the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow," he wrote in his report to customers Bernard Baumohl of Economic Outlook Group's consulting company.
"The coordinated actions of central banks have reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 per cent to fifty per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
The banks have already made $60 billion for unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what else can follow when they have decided on this process," said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
The central banks are concerned that if banks have difficult access to loans themselves, they will prefer to lend to their customers as well.
This would reduce consumption and send the US economy to recession with potential impacts on the economic growth of the world.
The central banks thus decided that the so-called LIBOR rate could not be reduced, the London interbank rate used to lend money to the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still worried about mutual lending money, and even though central banks in the United States, Canada and Britain had reduced their interest rate several times during the winter.
"It will have the same effect as another decrease in interest rates," said Agent Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not think that the central bank's move will contribute to the recovery of the crisis because it doesn't solve the basic problem, and that's the fall of the real estate market in the USA.
Klaus: Ecological debates are incredible
Global climate change is most likely to harm developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
The criticism has now come to the final UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he stated that ecological debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference, which creates a strange mix of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that binds it and the reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it is just a fire machine of words that is a substitute for solving the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President, in presenting his book, stressed that her theme is very important to him, and that is why he is so committed to it.
He also expressed satisfaction at the fact that the book also appeared in the German translation, because, as he said, "I often meet only with the cartoons of my opinions."
Now, then, the interested ones can read his unimaginable position.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write such a book.
He is therefore an academic, able to monitor and assess the trade unions, has experience with statistics and is also a national economy.
The main conclusions of the book indicated that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent opinion of all scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore do not pose a threat and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, as a person with experience with totality, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproved opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He has repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their use".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at Hayek Institute.
The driver couldn't replace 600 thousand people.
Six hundred thousand drivers went down and failed to exchange the old driver's license, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for an exchange to get them to the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is afraid that after New Year's time, they would be released on the road of the Statistic Drivers without a valid authorization.
According to the authorities, it has not been changed mainly to those who don't want to drive anymore.
While the municipality reports a sharp decline in the interest of the exchange of drivers, the authorities in the metropolis have been affected by requests and the interest in the exchange of tickets this week has grown.
The Magistrate delivers around 2,000 clients a day.
There's about half an hour waiting in the front.
In Prague, the driver's license has not yet changed some 140,000 drivers.
The exhibition of the new exhibition takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request an issue within a shorter period of five days.
In such a case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
For motorists who do not reach the end of the year and go on the road without a valid driver, it will be a threat of shock from the ice.
The offender shall pay no more than two thousand crowns.
But the police can solve the breach by agreeing.
In the case of administrative infringement, the fine shall be paid to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, he could have received a bribe from a counselor and a man who would not go anywhere.
He was supposed to pay 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had previously called on the authorities to be modest and to hold the maximum of a thousand crowns.
According to the Ministry of Transport, Karl Hanzelka's ten-thousand-thousand-thousand fines are harmless to anyone.
The driver's license is based on a document that allows people to decide whether or not they want it.
It's not a civil certificate that everyone has to have valid.
People who don't want to drive should give up a driver's license.
It shall only be transferred or sent by recommendation by mail to the competent public authority.
By the end of the year, the permits issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be paid.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of the tenders issued between 2001 and 2004 shall expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelky, it's about 2.6 million other documents.
The court reduced the sentences of detectives co-collaborating with Berdijk
Former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Konňarík, who are accused of having a criminal relationship with David Berdych gang, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years.
With the definitive validity of this decision, the Supreme Court of Prague decided to reduce the penalties so that they could be punished once a year and two years a year.
It initially threatened the Prague Crimes Committee's detectives for 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the present decision, only the appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdich is also accused in this case, but he is only waiting for the first instance verdict.
In other processes, however, he has already been sentenced to a total of more than 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Supreme Court acknowledged, in particular, the participation of 19 people who were guilty of theft, and today the Supreme Court has decided to withdraw 16 of them.
Most of the accused's complaints from the start of the investigation were rejected by the fact that they were the case under construction.
According to the Central Senate, police officers, inter alia, handed over information from police sources to criminals, covered a number of vicious attacks, and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
Gang gave up 30 percent for Opava and Horsemen for it.
The complaint concerns gang criminal activity from 1999 to 2001.
Especially the robbery, which victims have often suffered serious health damage, but also the abuse of the power of the public agent and the illicit use of weapons.
At home visits, the police discovered illegally held guns, steel cores, lasers, or self-defense guns.
Gang's been charged with robbery for tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to the unfathomable 20 men in this trial, the courts have already ruled guilty of other Berdych robbery and a number of other people.
Other men from around Berdych are still in trial in another trial, some cases have not yet been heard before the court.
The main character has so far been avoided by Tomáši Poitov and Maroši Šulejov, who live in an Irish prison where they await a final decision on their release for accession to the Czech Republic.
Children exchange account: 12 million
For the replacement of children at birth, the lawyer of damaged Igor Veleba's families wants 12 million crowns, plus judicial expenses, to be awarded to the hospital.
For every mother of three million, for father of two million, and for children of one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital Ondrøj Therefore, he disagrees with the Veleby proposal.
"We refuse such a requirement, it is very high," said he after today's discussion.
"But in order for us to make an opinion on the objection, we need an expert judgment that the opposite party has left to work out.
We'll find out if he has a corresponding value at all.
But we tend to believe that it will be in statistics for all," he stressed.
According to him, the share should move between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, a family in Jablon wanted a month when she did not raise her biological daughter, a million crowns.
Veleb served as a basis for negotiations on the compensation for the damage suffered by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motola.
Children’s parents, according to psychologists in the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological harm and stress in various degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better endured by men, even though they were struggling with the rumors that the replacement of the newborns did not stop them.
Women are again worse off with the current trauma and with what is happening right now, the contents of Veleba have been cut off.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses in the Tribune on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Kermákov to Pribyslavic and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslav Trojan to Jablonov.
Heitman Vysočina Milos Strutčil handed over each of the 100,000 crowns in late October to each family in return for their expenses caused by a miscarriage hospital that the country is setting up.
All the hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by the law for liability for damage.
In the event of a doubt, they must be transferred to the reserve fund and may exceptionally request the aid of the set-up.
The courts have so far recognized a relatively low level of compensation, the sums calculated according to the tables in statistics, with the exception of millions of crowns.
The Fall came about the kingdom of Valash
Bolek Polivka has lost the argument about the sign of the Kingdom of Wales.
According to the judge of the island court, he first used the name of the king of Wales, but the project built a long work around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor.
The hunt wasn't going on today.
According to his lawyer, the case probably doesn't end and the client's calling.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are paralysing in the popularity of Bolka Polivky," said Polivkov's lawyer after the process.
According to him, all of us in the words of the Kingdom of Wales are equipped with just actors and comics.
He has the same opinion as Harabish.
"There's almost a decade's work behind us.
Money laundering and the invention of actions," he said.
He thinks they're the cause of the money dispute.
"After years they realized that the project was successful and could have something to do with it.
They want to paralyze our work," he added.
Charging business
According to the court, the king of Wales first used Polivka in his television series.
In 1993 she was crowned by the actor Radoslav Quickorichty.
But then it did not have to do with the purpose of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of issuing Welsh belts.
From the original recession action, trade and lucrative business activity were excluded, on which Harabiš was then linked to the establishment of the Kingdom of Wales.
In 1997 Polívka agreed with the introduction of his name and signature in his walk and even offered their holders discounts at the visit of his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš has only used the bare idea that Polivka published in the management for his business purpose.
"The Popularity of Boleslav's Falling of the project of the Valash Kingdom certainly helped," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who had made an intensive dedication to him.
The cooperation today continued until 2000, when Harabiš organised official coronation in the Vsetina.
Since then, however, there have been disputes between Polívka and Harabusch, which have led to the meeting of the "King of Boleslav I selected for the furt".
The lead role in the kingdom was then captured by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as a royal mother in the valley of Harabis.
In 2002, Polivka filed a complaint with Harabiš and his company, which he rejected today.
Clearly, it could lead to the dispute by Haraish's captured curse of the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to know the details and the time.
"We don't want to make any progress.
It should be something like a king's ride to Slovakia.
The king should be free for a certain time.
And Mr. Polivka can quietly log in," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: mixed prepositions
Actually, I never fantasized a lot of Peugeot 206.
His driving characteristics were not very much, the quality of sorting, handling, and also the production would be marked by lecks as a mean.
But the market is now the successor of Peugeot 207, and the one is much better.
And the van called SW is still a bit further, and I'm not left to think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the space on my head in the back seat.
This is already the end of the complaint, because the van's body means that there will be no two-metre lengths in this direction.
The Summer of the World
I'm going through the interior very quickly so I don't get too repeated.
It's a whole kind of design, where I'm the only one with a poor middle tunnel.
Here I'd appreciate something more designer invention when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and you're there when we could complain about short seats or get drunk.
Side management also improved significantly against model 206.
As far as space is concerned, there is an increase in the size of the body.
Then, in the van, the said lack of room above the head.
Cached
So the main one on this car is his trailer.
I have to assess it as very well accessible (and also due to the release of the back window) and as properly consistent.
The deaf spots are equipped with retaining rubber, which are an ideal compromise.
It doesn't cross, it can spread, and it will keep even harder objects.
But let's stay together over the volume.
According to the table in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is more than the average value against competition.
However, not against the most sold car of this class in the Czech Republic - Damage Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with a new generation of juvenileslavic products, then we will find that Peugeot is left with a lot of well-known 52 liters.
This value is to be considered as a critical value on a holiday abroad or when loading a cart.
But if I should raise the positive, I still have to mention a completely flat floor after a second row or very low dust.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with an inlet quadruple with a capacity of 1,6 l with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, this is how it should look like a sixteen-year-old who's moving a family hatchback.
She's quiet, she's having a little consumption, and she's mostly pulling.
If I compare it to a period of damage that can barely work, as if it had a hadr attached to it, I can only be excited about it.
The price will rise
The price of the car is not human.
However, we must remember that we tested properly equipped cars with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a four-wheel drive for 329 900 CZK will still go away.
Our aggregate is 410 900 CZK, which is enough.
The test equipment Premium will then be equipped for another 80,000 CZK designs.
Although we still had the main airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic driver discharge, electrical control of the rear windows...
It's just the car stands all over 531,900 CZK.
It's a lot, but count the extra equipment at Fabie and you'll get a lot like that.
So there's no left to decide for the badge.
The integration of Slovenian pupils in British schools is not possible
In British schools, children from Eastern Europe arrive, and local residents are concerned about the further development of local schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far impacted on a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the original population are becoming more violent.
The problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated in the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovenian immigrants begin to be staged.
The jokes, the jokes, and the fights between the pupils also moved into the relationship between the parents.
The situation went so far as to keep a Slovenian woman in Chatham holding a ten-year-old girl with a iron tip.
She's guilty of defending herself from being attacked by racists.
The police had to intervene even after the two-year-old girls were attacked by a Slovenian immigrant.
The girls of the men reportedly honored the racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, some guy jumped out on the bus stop and started swimming on us.
When I told him to let it go, he looked at us with apples and thorns, and then he discovered his ass," she described another unpleasant occasion for The Times mother of Slovenian students.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the local residents even marked disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe for the fight against survival.
The above mentioned cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between local and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
In Britain, 70,000 Slovaks have been registered, who have headed for work.
Then 30 thousand Slovenian students visit the British school.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can be fulfilled if you choose the right course.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm as a fisherman.
Palms and all inclusive with cabinets, offering on the beach pizza, ice cream and side cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you will find it in full and even richer calculation.
Only on one island will you find much more, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
For the Spaniards, Cuba was the heritage of their America.
Columbus identified her as the most beautiful place that human eyes have ever seen.
Havana became the warehouse and translation site of the treasures that the Spanish people in the Americas have laid and moved to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The Hotel Nacional grew up at the end of the 20th.
He let him build one of the heads of the American Mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the United States (particularly for the ban) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
His guests were mine.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high - school homes grew, and after a wide variety of bullies, cars that belonged to the cultural symbols of the 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought his property in San Francisco de Paula, a piece from Havana, and in Cojímaru he had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, they left their signatures to show business stars and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Havana Bodeguito you can leave your autograph as well.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, you will be served with cocktails according to your wishes.
And those 50-year-old cult cars are driving down Havana so far, because sometimes imported chips and fiats in that salty and wet air have long gone off.
Although Havana is, in particular, the oldest part of it, much to blame, there are not so many beautiful colonial monuments anywhere in the area as just there.
Other places also turn into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Since travel brings so much money, its development is green.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but in particular in Varadera, on the coast of Holguín and in islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another librarian, which is unique in the world and is particularly appreciated by the train drivers.
A third of the scattered plantations were tied to sugarcane by narrow wheels of steam and motor trains.
Their car park hasn't been renewed for decades, and so there are machines that work there, whose layers are still in museums.
Where to go?
Most of Cuba's visitors don't have the most famous places.
And so about Varadera, or Havana, you don't have to sign up too much.
I just wish to remind you that in Hemingway's settlement already mentioned is a museum, and whoever likes this writer should not miss a visit.
The valley of Vináles One of Cuba's most picturesque corners is the valley of Vináles in the west of the island.
The green vegetation grows from the base of the volcano.
The potentials, arms and rocks rise sharply from the bottom of the valley, and in their dunes a fertile land has been avoided, thus also being a massive scale covered by dense growth.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is growing.
You can meet with his final image if you visit any of the Havana factories for the production of passengers.
Perhaps someone will also be interested in the fact that Major Zeman was involved in the Chilean section.
Trinidad
The ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
His fame and wealth brought him a trade with slaves and sugar.
Wealth turned into the beauty and exhibition of a small town.
The colonial Spanish architecture, particularly influenced by later French settlers, has almost changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountains of Escambray, is a place so remote that in the 50th century, there was no road there that that country would connect with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing happened there, and that's why nothing happened, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If a person has more time on the Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at the interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Ancón Beach, or the Gulf of Sugar.
The evening then belongs to the Casa de la Música, who lives after the harvest and the music in it is quiet over the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the very east of Cuba is marked by some as the most beautiful on the island.
The dozoist's opinion is already affecting the road itself.
Both the roads leading there with the Guantanam must overcome the high and the members of the mountains and pass through a nature that the human activity has not nearly marked.
Cuba's eastern island has been registered by UNESCO thanks to its uninterrupted nature on the list of world heritage.
They make the best chocolate there, in the church they have the Columbus cross (in fact it was a hundred years after Columbus swimming) and from the hill, where there is a castle and today's Hotel El Castillo, there are several tables, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, dolls, about the mountain of Sierra Maestra, about the Bay of Pigs and Island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropican Cabaret, about the holiness of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the santeria, the African religions that recognize the descendants of some of the slaves, it would be possible to describe many pages.
But, as they call it, it's better to see once.
The allies in Afghanistan are passive, U.S.
Few soldiers and lack of equipment are affected by the United States during the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should plan a specific plan for next year.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place as envisaged by the representatives of the countries with units in the southern part of the country in Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban movement, eight participating States are today discussing other plans and coordination of their allies.
While the United States, through Minister of Defence Robert Gates, has called NATO units for greater activity this week, Britain sees a priority in strengthening the Afghan government's authority and strengthening development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is material, but military forces can only be one part of the solution.
The next is to allow citizens to start further development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne said at the BBC station.
Ninety percent
The activities of the Afghan rebels are, according to the U.S. Army data, highest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts rose against 27 per cent last year, in the southern province of Helmand even 60 per cent.
NATO countries have approximately 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which about a quarter in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the compounds reached the same limit in the organisation and equipment units.
They specifically ask for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about specific goals for the next time and ways to achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense today, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke.
"I am not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's little," said Reuters De Hoop at the end of the class talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, disputes have also been raised between participating countries as to whether all allies are taking maximum action in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticised for its liability.
"The Germans have relatively large representations in Afghanistan.
But they are located in areas where at least violence and war claims on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
This week, the British bulwark letter Sun marked the German soldiers as Lennox.
"Afghan's retreats are revealed: Germans play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in material, supplemented by images of German soldiers playing table tennis.
Germany's image of the British unit in a race match in southern Afghanistan went into a counterattack.
State debt will rise to a billion in 2009
In every Czech country, the state debt is over 84,000 crowns.
Total debt rose to the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government was planning to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
State debt of the Czech Republic rose to the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
In nine months this year, it has increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, it has been reduced by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its state debt data from the beginning of October.
In every Czech country, there's a debt over 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"At the same time, it seems that due to the lower deficit for next year, we could overcome the billions of crowns by 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and billion crowns," said the iHNed.cz analyst Patria Finance David Marek for the server.
Similarly, the analyst Next Finance Vladimir Pikor says: "To exceed one billion we could get in the course of 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to walk more, it could be moved to 2010.
But I do not propose this change," he said.
Finger-twitching good
The State debt constitutes the central government's debt and generates, in particular, the accumulation of state budget deficits.
State debt is financed by cash notes, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has so far risen by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debt of the state has so far increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
So-called state-owned debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and declined by 13.7 billion crowns since June.
The State debt average has increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt for the first to the third quarter rose by 13 per cent, which is really much about how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, growth is generated mainly in bonds where 20 per cent is growth.
It is bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that it will deal with what it will do when the pension reform is here," Pikora said.
Better than waiting.
The 2007 government has planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The share represents, in particular, a deficit in the State budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion crowns.
It is also a planned maximum resource for the Czech Consolidation Agency of 13.3 billion crowns, a ten-billion-dollar reserve for the payment of income, the financing of state bonds for 43 billion crowns and the European Investment Bank's loan of 1.8 billion crowns.
A woman is to be brought to the Court in the Charter today for giving the name of a caste bear
On Thursday night, a British teacher, convicted in Sudan for violating Islam, was sentenced to a 15-day prison by the Court of Justice and sentenced to trial, as her lawyer stated.
Britka was accused of letting six to seven-year-olds give a glaucoma bear's name Mohammed despite the fact that any representation of the prophet to Islam is forbidden.
It was a detailed punishment of a bull wound.
This British forty-four-year-old teacher, acting at the United High School in the Sudan Charter, was arrested at home on Sunday and charged with attacks on Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Law, after the parents of several pupils complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story begins in fact already in September when the student in question asks his six to seven-year-old students to choose the name for the class of caste bear.
"With the mouth of children, eight names, among them Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed," says school director Robert Boulos.
After voting in the class, 20 of the 23 children finally choose the most popular name, Mohamed.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all it is a very extended Christian name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a script: "My name is Mohamed."
The bear himself had no label with that name, but it was in the prophet’s own appearance considered to be an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, made it clear that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious faith: "I only regret that she asked the children to vote for some name," he said only about "innocent doubt".
Such an opinion is shared by many teachers who describe it as "very attentive to their students" and deliver that "never in class is spoken of as a religion".
Remember that the Christian name Mohamed is also the second most frequently named Christian name in the United Kingdom, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This Christian name often chosen by Muslim families represents a way of worshiping the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of this Christian name?
Is it possible, for example, to give them toys?
Of course, it's a question of interpretation.
In the last round, this centre in Vienna did not reach agreement on the future status of the province.
It's not finally a success.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians completed the sixth round of talks in Austria on Wednesday morning and at the same time, without overcoming different views on the future status of this separatist province.
"It is politically appropriate that both parties were unable to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during the press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area is "in good faith" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to keep the interests of their commitments at peace and were ready for dialogue after the end of the negotiations.
"We don't expect violence at the nearest time, but we enter a demanding period," he added, "it's obvious that the situation is tense."
The negotiations shall end on 10 December.
Trojka negotiators, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last be exported to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90% of Albanian-speaking populations are made up, could be shown in a clearer light by December 10th, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexandr Bocan-Charchenko are going to deliver their message to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and at the same time the last round of negotiations since the United Nations, in August of this year, entrusted Troika with a new negotiation.
The Americans and Europeans are counting on the end of the talks on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked Kosovo's independence from the UN Security Council, insist on the continuation of the negotiations after this very deadline.
"Russia has been and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Bocan-Charchenko said.
Single declaration of independence?
After eight years of international governance, the West considers Kosovo's independence under the EU's sole constitutional solution.
Pristina declares that, in the event that the Security Council does not decide for its own good, it is prepared to declare independence on the one hand.
Belgrade takes on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached an agreement," said President Fatmir Sejdiu of Kosovo's Self-Government at the Badden Hotel, where this "last chance" has been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, a former Kosovo Albanian leader and future Prime Minister, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade "is part of the past that led to murders and deportations".
"Dominic Effect"
On the contrary, Serbian President Boris Tadic believes that the compromise is still being considered and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of the unilaterally declared independence of the province.
In particular, Belgrade is concerned about the "domain effect" in the area, which is still unstable as a result of the war for independence in the 1990s.
"But it doesn't mean for Serbia," he said, "that compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions be taken exclusively by the Security Council in which its Russian associate has the right to veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"The only solution from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"This conversation lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the last word of status will be held by the Kosovo Parliament" and added that if a unilateral declaration of independence was made by Albanian-speaking citizens, it would be done "by agreement" with the West.
Bush made a deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians.
At the start of an international peace conference in Annapolis in Maryland, the American President George Bush announced that the Israelis and the Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed at the immediate start of the negotiations with the intention of always resolving a 60-year ongoing dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both Bush men, he promised to do everything he could to help them make a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end up with colonial activities, Bush declared and recalled the obligations that both parties have assumed from the "road map" to the peace that they adopted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian self-government led by Abbas were aimed at "the conclusion of a peace treaty which would resolve all undecided issues without exception, including central issues".
This statement includes three issues that are at the heart of the dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who were expelled during the 1948 conflict from their homes in the territory of the present state of Israel.
Abbas took note of the words of the U.S. President and stressed that the following negotiations were "total and thorough" and that all aspects of the solution were affected by the reference to "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, etc.".
Then Olmert came to the court, who expressed the view that the following negotiations should be "right and continuous" and that it should be "ruled to be concluded during 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the deadline for the realization of his "two-state vision", the Palestinian and Israeli, existing by itself.
Saudi Arabia has declared that it has accepted a commitment from Bush in this sense even before it decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that Israel offers peace in exchange for leaving all Arab territories banned for war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, in particular because it fights the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", judges Prince Saud in an interview that provided one Arab speech diary protected by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutors, the police are not responsible.
What just happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small reports from black chronicle, the official version disagrees with what is said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the French State Police Inspectorate General (Inspection de la police nationale, IGPN), the police car drove on Sunday shortly after the 17th hour of Louise-Michel Street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in operation, but was on the watch and traveled at speeds 40 to 50 km/h, but there were no side lights on," explains the police source.
The green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "unregistered, and therefore without permission to drive in public communications" (read below), driven by two young people without a trailer, ran "very high speed".
"The motorcycle hit the left-hand side of the police car after it didn't give priority to the report," said one police officer.
The blood alcohol test carried out on the vehicle crew showed negative.
The condition of the car (the damaged front, the broken front glass, the broken bumpers) is a witness to the rigidity of the attack.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (Republique de Pontoise) very quickly informed Marie-Thérèse de Givry and already announced yesterday that IGPN had commissioned the investigation of "the acts of inhuman murder and the failure to provide assistance to persons in danger", which was also taken by the departmental de la súrété public du Val-d'Oise (Directorate of the National Police Department of Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
Three witness incidents that were under investigation on Sunday night confirmed, according to the office, "the version of the policemen, because the minimator approached them quite quickly on the left."
Like rice, no doubt caused by a third of the ground clips, she showed yesterday that both vehicles were locked up until the police car was able to speed up.
The vehicles were secured and passed through technical expertise.
There was a drink yesterday on the bodies of both victims.
What happened, right after?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, people were quickly spreading the word that the police should quickly leave the scene without giving the two young men the first help.
IGPN should, in all caution, also exclude "any serious offense" from this point.
"It is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation and with which it is necessary to be very careful," the police source said.
The liberation journal met with an obvious witness for a few moments after the accident.
One of his windows then leads directly to where the accident took place.
"We immediately ran down with a nurse who is a nurse in the hospital to try to raise them," the witness says.
I couldn't do anything."
Then he saw a "screaming, totally scared cop.
Two others tried to raise one of the young and the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with a rapidly rising tension and certainly present, the situation of young people is hopeless, police officers were driven by colleagues who, in the meantime, arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the rescue arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left."
They also carried out a massage of the heart, but it's terrible.
"Let no one claim that the police have failed to help young people.
These young people were given first aid.
The Hassichs are here immediately.
Everything was done for their salvation," the prosecutor stressed.
Growth tensions in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police pressed the first demonstration since the declaration of an exceptional status by General Musaraf, two days earlier.
In Lahor, the country's east, about 2,000 lawyers, demonstrating against measures taken under an exceptional situation, were injured by shell gas grenades, which, according to the witnesses, used regular forces.
The last appointment was answered by a stone, which injured several policemen.
At least 350 lawyers were called.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and wounded lawyers.
Several were supposed to be called.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court called after the general stand and announced demonstrations, resulting in about five hundred arrests of opponents, fighters for human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were overheated on Monday morning in order to prevent meetings.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
On Monday, the movement of lawmakers was supported by the religious parties involved in the political strong alliance of Muttahida Milis-e-Amal, whose president "received the population to send flowers to the judges who stood up against the exceptional state and the wastes to those who made an oath before the Musharaf".
"The man's promise doesn't pay."
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of the extraordinary measure declared on Saturday night.
In the next few days, President Musharraf's legal re-election in the indirect presidential election, which took place on 6 October, was to take place.
The President of the court of Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
"All that we are witnesses of is illegal, unlawful and against the judgments of the Supreme Court," said the official in The News.
Slib Parvíze Mušarafa, who surrenders to the leadership of the army and becomes a civilian president after the establishment of an exceptional status, announced on Monday the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that military uniforms would be surrendered until November 15th, when his first presidential mandate was completed.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the ice elections could be postponed.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government has also failed in the country's ongoing speculation, according to which the deputy chief of the army had to order President Musharraf's house arrest.
More than a third of the pregnancy still forms an unexpected pregnancy
This estimate includes unintended (24%) pregnancy, as well as poorly planned or developed in an unexpected manner.
More than one out of three (36%) is still not expected today, a study conducted by the French National Institute d'études demografiques (Ined)- the State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which in France enacted the anti-conception.
This estimate includes unintended (24%) pregnancy, as well as poorly planned or developed in an unexpected manner.
Different methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still account for 5% to 6% of the rate of failure.
However, anti-conception legislation only allowed for better "fertilence control", the Constitution states, and notes that the rate of use of hormonal contraceptive in women between 20 and 44 years of age was now 60% from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight generations of ten today are well planned.
One couple of five has a birth even calculated for a month exactly and if possible in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant annual period for the birth of a child.
Observational repair of space station
More than seven hours of space work required the astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to make a remarkable repair of the scattered solar panel necessary for further scientific activity of the station.
It was a risky exit to space, which collected records as long as the duration, distance from residential modules, the speed with which it was planned, and the size of the "artificial" which the astronauts have imposed on the repair.
Problems arose on Tuesday, while astronauts from the Discovery ship released the Harmony module, a large military service designed to install European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a docking mill for the modules-laborator.
But you need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move the seventeen-year-old module producing electricity through solar panels that were already on the ISS, so that it could move in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began to deploy seventy-metre solar panels of the module.
And in this, one of the panels, which are decomposing as a pulling harmonica, was damaged on the surface of a single meter.
Disposal was suspended to prevent further panel damage.
Astronauts, who were originally supposed to perform a control release on the Discovery ship, and subsequently to go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to commit to the damaged panel.
And it was just Scott Parazynski, who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic shoulder of the ship, which was attached to the shoulder of the station, and did the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalkers (space walk) of the United States Aviation and Space Agency (NASA).
High, static, very turning, has a very elaborate chest and long belt.
In his 46 years, this initial call was entrusted to the doctor by "operating" the "damaged" solar panel.
After carefully examining the damage, he removed the water cable and secured the damaged sites some "dlahy".
The second spacewalker, who remained near the balance chamber, and also inside, other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, commander of the crew.
Orders which he used, namely a mini-cooked insulation device to prevent electric shocks on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "after angle" produced astronauts on board the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully distributed and then invented his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed their afternoon rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
The EADS action weakens
The EADS stock is likely to be lost at the Paris Stock Exchange after this company operating in the aviation and defence industry announced that it will have to spend 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros to meet the delay of the A400M airport.
EADS has lost 4% and is now at the Paris Stock Exchange for 21,96 euros.
The financial group was forced to reassess its expected production results for 2007 as a result of delays in the progress of the A400M engine development process, which is the condition of the start-up flight.
The price for the reduction of delays in the deliveries of the military cargo aircraft, reported in October, was estimated "at 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than billion for Airbus", the parent company of the European construction company EADS announced.
For these costs, EADS will be required, on Thursday, to announce a new view of the profit before the deduction of interest and tax (EBIT).
The group also found that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Note that the production results of EADS in 2006 fell by 86%, in particular due to the costs associated with the delay of the other programme, i.e. the heavy A380 airport.
The group initially assumed that the first delivery of the A400M airport would be made by the French army in October 2009.
Decision for status quo
Sunday's elections will take place without any hesitation: the Russian majority will elect President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming this, after the end of a very little free election campaign, its tendency to stability, and to authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the House of Ambassadors, Russian President Vladimir Putin will inform the voters at public stations of a television broadcast, the content of which is kept secret.
It is from the position of the leader of the United Russia, the procreative party, which, according to all, celebrates a sober victory.
Last night, when he accepted the ambassadors of foreign states, the president let nothing out of him and sat down with another attack on the West indicted - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and wish ourselves to be honest, as much as possible the most transparent and unopen choices, choices without the slightest harm to beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it's not so far.
They're depriving the campaign of various pressures.
The Communist leader Gennadij Zjuganov says that "they've never made such a dirty choice, not even for Jelcina."
After the repression of last week's demonstrations, the former world champion in Garry Kasparov's chess, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, has continued to ban visits, according to his lawyer.
"Russia remains the mentality of a Soviet homo"
In the light of the following parliamentary elections, two far-reaching questions are being raised:
"Who will become Putin's successor in the presidential office?
The Official Journal last night published the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates can be represented by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, is unable to reach a third mandate in order.
However, no successor appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be the prime minister?
Or the leader of the majority of Parliament and the all-powerful side of the United Russia, who elects the government and the president?
Whether it is as or not, the ruling power will win the whole race in parliamentary elections as well as in presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have remained the mentality of the Soviets, they do not feel worthy of their destiny," sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada, says.
The history of Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of St. Petersburg has always been far-reaching: civil society has taken, in this country baptized five centuries after Europe, a delay; that famous common spirit has left the creation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin linked to a state's patriarchal model, perfectly accepted by the population, rather than the fact that this new patriotism did not go through terror, but some economic prosperity," says Maria Lipman of Carnegie's Foundation.
The Russians today are "voluntaryly giving up their personal responsibilities", which they soon proved after the collapse of the USSR.
"What's to think about?"
This phenomenon concerns all social classes, including the commercial world.
The official elite also intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of the total number of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, a synonym for chaos.
Public opinion gives priority to stability.
Also on behalf of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Tamary Czerdnikenko's conclusion, fourteen-year-old professors: "What do you think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded Memory
After more than sixty years in the confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which are similar to those of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, open up to the public.
47 million archived documents stored 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were currently only available for "humanitarian" purposes, which means individually and specifically, at the request of the former victims or its authorised persons.
Eleven States entrusted with the management of archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
In view of the fact that the process of ratification of this Agreement by all States is at the end of last night, the opening took effect.
Other information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will be possible to examine "particularly the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, a number of states, including Germany, have been opposed to the making available of these nominal public documents due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some of the victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or hostages compiled by the Gestapo were gathered after the war for a practical purpose to find deported or forced work for the detailed civilian population, to give them proof of their admission in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are dealing with dozens of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
"There is nothing new about these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism of Berlin Technische Universität, in 2006.
EU and India want to reach free trade agreements in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India is already at a cost of EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect the signing of the Free Trade Agreement in 2008 and the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath announced.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave a green European Commission to start negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean) with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALEs) with India, South Korea and bilateral trade between Europe and India.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, India, however, according to the European Commission, to the ninth EU trading partner.
"The Free Trade Agreement greatly affects both economies" and "India will gain better access to the 450 million prospering European markets," Peter Mandelson added.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported to India, the European Commissioner explained. The Asian and European giant, together with "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential". The EU and India meet at the 8th joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singha and President of the European Commission José Manuel Dura Barroso on Friday.

The English bank took care of the concerns and offered 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction
On Thursday, the British Bank stated that it was intended to reduce the current concern that the credit market would again deteriorate and declared the offer of 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction at a basic interest rate of 5,75 %, the offer would not normally be valid for long.
"In an effort to ease concerns that the conditions on the financial markets will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and give banks greater security in how to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserves during the maintenance period, which starts on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," the Communication reported.
The Bank makes it clear that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January at a basic interest rate.
It seems to be the first thing that BOE is pumping cash on the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They usually last a week.
BOE adds in its Communication that "it remains ready to take other measures to maintain interday interest rates" interbank loans at the same level with its basic rate.
The inter-day interbank interest rate was 5,829 % on average.
The three-month interest rate was set at 6,6 %, which is the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the annual financial crisis, amounts have been placed on the financial market by the Bank of England linked to the fees charged by the banks from the use of this offer.
According to certain speculations reinforced by the evolution of the euro's pound rate, many have preferred to decide on the amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more discreetness.
UMP (Union pour un movement populare, Union for People's Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to address the proposals of the Socialists (PS) on purchasing power
The UMP and the New Centre clubs refused to discuss on Thursday the individual paragraphs of the Socialist proposal of the Law on Buyability, which is equal to the rejection of the text.
In the course of the day, the text of the bill was received within the framework of the so-called socialist "hnyzda" (a meeting initiated by the single MEP) and contained dozens of measures taken by the PS presidency Tuesday, including an increase in the employment premium of 50 %, the renewal of the colliery TIPP, the transport check or the rental regulation.
In view of the fact that the UMP and the NC voted against the discussion of the individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was concluded after the general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television show on purchasing power.
The head of the PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will resubmit these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the amendment to the Finance Act, which will be discussed next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of a lot of speculation that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is establishing a new festival, this promoter/producer Wineland Festival in New Jersey announced in collaboration with the Festival Republic of the British Order of Melvin Benn.
"It's an honor for our company to work with a man who inspired the current festival movements in America without any effort," explained Charlie Jones from the Billboard.com C3 server.
C3 is produced by the Chicago Festival Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is the summer target station of champions.
The festival should take place from August 8th to 10th on a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, I know earlier named Mean Fiddler, one of the world's most notable festival rangers.
In 1989, Cormida Reading Festival was held in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added to his portfolio Leeds Festival, then in 2006 the Festival Republic founded Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
In 2002, Melvin Benn, a co-owner, also has production, licenses and organizational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which currently has up to 177 500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 refers to Glastonbury as "the most inspiring event", which he has ever experienced, and says that his Melvina Benna and Melvina are working at the same time to give the region a festival event of European style.
"In the beginning, we chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to set up a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"I shared with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, due to the current leadership of the city, Charlie Jones adds.
" Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Ben and we are going to set up a great festival in an exceptional place that will eventually serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents in 2005 created the Lollapalooz festival in Chicago's Grant Park, after they emerged on the festival stage in 2002 by organizing Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The rough trades of both events for 2007 amounted to $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of the Melvin Benn festival is taking place in the countryside, while our festivals are taking place at green spaces in the cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our aim is to combine both concepts in a certain way so that we can create both the perceptions of the rural festival after Europe and the city after America."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Obec Vineland, including the elders, is delighted to support the realization of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The last appointed person refuses to make the terms of the agreement, however, claims that "they are useful enough to allow them to invest in such an event and welcome the festival that will have, hopefully, a long duration".
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will include 80,000 people.
He says the groups have already been sent invitations, but nothing can be confirmed at the moment the program is just put in the press.
"Vineland's gonna have a rock breath, but music's gonna be cool there if we can attract a wide range of spectators," says Carlie Jones.
The partners of C3, who received the top Independent Promoter prize in the last year of the Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal Head of Terminator
It's not easy to attach Hollywood film studios to Montreal, when it's set up by the Terminator itself...
This conviction mission is one of the tasks of the delegates.
His mandate, however, is "politically demanding" because Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it hard to drop the Governor into the traps?
"Be careful, it's industry, who decides where he's going.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, he'll go there.
Our task is to offer them what they will consider to be the best," he said.
Honba for festivals
At the moment, however, Denise Turcottea's priority is to promote the local film.
She's already starting to honor Oscars.
At all the festivals of the West Coast, whether it's the festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it's about to introduce Quebec films, to warn them and to ensure that the directors provide interviews.
A few weeks ago, he had good publicity at Mill Valley Film Festival in his 30th year.
In January, he will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month Quebec also introduced four short films and four entire evening films at the American Film Institute Festu.
Does it come at the end of the year to the marathon? Experts divided the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and the investors already hand in hand to expect me to come to a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
But this year, experts aren't so sure he's coming to him.
Bank Banif is believed to be "from a statistical point of view, a month of December at the stock exchange".
However, it is not possible to create forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, in the current context of the markets, at least in the short term, certain doubts are being raised."
These experts do not assume that the stock exchange is changing over the last few weeks and state that "the stock exchange market is maintaining the existence of liquidity, which is ready to invest due to the missing alternatives with guarantees, especially a firm income affected by the return on quality securities, as in the long term as in short notices".
Therefore, it is believed that the stock exchange will have a calmer course than without a volatility, "especially because it is not known the impact of the likely loss of FED (Federal Reserve System), given the high level of oil prices and the danger of inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, the head of BPI's bank in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time for a bold statement that comes to marathon.
"There are not too many reasons for joy," this expert assures.
Ibex lost almost 4 % of the maximum values recorded on 8 November when the index ended at 15 945.7 points.
However, all experts do not have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end the year by something close to 16,000 points due to the transfer of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension insurance, which is happening every year at this time.
However, this expert points out that this year will be a little different because it is believed that marathon will take place earlier, in the second December week after the extended weekend at the occasion of the Constitution Day.
This analyst does not think that the volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversion Banco, also estimates that we are approaching a technical level and "that is why we can see the reflection of the index, which has been called from the US reports on the impact of the credit crisis on the market".
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of titles that take care of bringing Ibex to a new maximum quota.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that this year is a series of strong titles.
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
On the contrary, Federico Olucha from Invers Banko ensures that the growth will go hand in hand with banking and industry.
Building companies will also be able to enjoy this marathon if it comes to it.
"ACS has been in position for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will go the same way," the expert explains.
cyclic consumption will be in advance in the last part of the year due to an increase in sales during the Christmas sale period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technology will also be very good, even though they are not in the Spanish market too.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December was only two months of failure.
A real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, in the administrative year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the explosion of technological bubbles.
This year, when Ibex 35 received 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6,68%.
We will see if 2007 will be in line with the fifth profit year (now Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will be able to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred side of Popular bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to modernise most of its branches.
A total of two beds, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These sides operated under the popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Similarly, for other Spanish entities, it is the first group to decide to make such a jump and place on the continuous opening time of its branches up to 20.30 hours and to open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group that has also several times assured that it wants to extend the opening time of its branches, has not yet decided to do so.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the opening committees of 75 % of its auctions on Saturday for the extension of the opening time by one afternoon, even if not for the public.
The results of this experience will be decisive for other entities to join or not to support the opening-up of the business period.
That's exactly the purpose of the project that ran out of the Popular Bank.
Get individual customers who are spending in these places behind their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, practitioners and shops from the selected streets, where they can open the branch.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain for about 18 months, because it is not the same as opening new branches, but only for the modification of existing ones.
For this reason, the bank modernises the branches that already have in commercial areas by adapting the customer profile in individual streets.
This complements the extension of the opening time with other features of the side and the new, more current design in brighter colors.
The bank manager of Ángel Rivera ensures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but a larger recruitment of staff, as it goes from six employees to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with premises for small and medium-sized enterprises and will sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
The Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel River explains.
The sidewalks were selected in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera it seems that it was a happy choice.
The Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And the other 60 specialists on immigrants who are operated under the Mondocredit brand also have a very long opening time and even opened on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax will not follow the BBVA model when a number of its branches offer a large scale of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to compete with our clients," says Rivera.
They just agreed with Telefónica on the sale of mobile phones through external personnel.
Telecinco first doubles the value of his rival Anteny 3
We've done it.
That is what Paolo Vasile, the executive president of Telecinco, said yesterday, with his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trade, when he found that the television he was running doubled the value of his rival Antenna 3.
Only one thing said his joy: 'What I'm sorry about is that it didn't happen that way because we would grow more, but because we've fallen less', we said.
And then he stressed that, thanks to the poor market, 'we've fallen less'.
Telecinco finished its business with a transfer of 2,54 % yesterday.
This profit led to a loss of 15,66 % over the last part of the year.
The exchange value of this company controlled by Mediacem (with 52% of the capital) for the participation of Vocenta (with 13%) thus amounts to EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg.
Her rival Antena 3, which dropped by 1.52% yesterday and dropped by 40.5% from January, has a half value of 2 193,46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that were assessed is 3,571 billion in Sogecable, 2,518,53 million Prisa (publisher Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 offers 'cause we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do on the same market at what price and how we assess it in monitoring'.
Telecinco announced last week that this year it is calculated that over billions of gross advertising revenues will become the first television channel, as Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, assured by the group's advertising side.
If the data were actually obtained, this television channel would record this year's increase in advertising turnover by 3,6 %, compared to 965,4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, pure Antenna increased by 1,6 % (and reached 734,4 million), while net revenues of this television increased by 0.7 % (630,4 million).
One of the factors to which analysts are focusing is the increased payout for the best relative development of Telecinco in the stock market, which has so far been maintained: in 2006 this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, divided between its shareholders by 100 % of its profit.
Vasile ensures that, although it is to be decided soon, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33 % of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official obligation to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, which we have already raised 33% of Endemol'.
According to market analysts, at these times, it shows a certain decline.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its Telecinco profit estimates, which was 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the forecast growth from 0.5 % to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5 % to 5.1 % in 2009.
Tataz has reduced Antenna’s expected profit by 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.

Congress approved the transposition of MiFID as from 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary proceedings, which were concluded today by the vote of the Congress on the new members of the Senate in the draft law, the government has submitted a public hearing to the regulation developing the new law with a view to the entry into force of both of them before the end of the year.
The representatives of the individual parties agreed on the efforts of the Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to ensure the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of the actors necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernisation of financial markets and at the same time enhances investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and supports cooperation between the individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation enables financial consulting services to be provided to specialised companies, both natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services provider (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFI) that are connected to a company with securities, through offices with securities and portfolio management.
In addition, the number of financial instruments operating systems is widened so that regulated secondary markets are joined by multilateral trading systems and internalisation systems that will compete with current stock exchangers.
The Act further obliges companies providing investment services to disseminate on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and risk-equipment practices, and requires a list of all operations carried out to simplify supervision by CNMV.
During the discussion in the Trade Commission of the Congress, a number of amendments were made to ensure that the securitised loans were regarded as a "complex" financial instrument in view of the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what happened in the USA with high risk mortgage debt (subprime).
Moreover, the transposition of the Directive was used to legalise functions that can be stopped by bakers in the field of economics and business management 30 years after a Royal Decree was passed in 1977, which covers professional functions excluded from economics.
At the same time, the Senate has arranged for the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as the intermediary who will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading services and customer acquisition services for different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised ISC increased by five tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union's inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB)'s policy to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods for estimates of information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Statistical Institute) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily have to be consistent with the final data available on 14 December of this year.
"ISC will continue to be maintained at relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes stated that the November ISC increase to 4.1% is "temporary number", but also predicted that the price index will continue to be relatively high in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes in the Kullora Congress made it clear that "even if it is not a positive number", the inflation differential in Spain towards the monetary union is still "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November was "less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not count with such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the Minister of Economy introduced the data presented today.
Virgin is going to make a plan with Northern Rock 42 billion euros in three years
Since the fall in September, the Bank of Northern Rock has been in crisis and has had to turn to a bank of England's emergency loan, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
At that time, the bank adjusted the record deposits of more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually declined over two and a half months, despite the fact that the government offered a cash guarantee and extended it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who replaces the entity's trade mark Virgin Money, needs to earn around a quarter of the revenues invested in British banks over the next three years, so that they get the remaining 18 billion pounds and thus achieve a target of 30 billion.
Richard Branson, a group of magnets known in the United Kingdom by their creative advertising campaigns, is planning to spend 50 million pounds (approximately 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing in order to reach its chairmanship.
The Bank of Northern Rock this week marked the offer of the Virgin Consortium, which creates three other companies, such as those that give priority to saving them from bankruptcy.
Old Town of Totany arrested for alleged corrupt practices in construction
The civil guard today, in the early hours of the morning, kept the present old man of the city of Totana (of the People's Party) for his alleged involvement in corrupt practices in the construction that had been discovered this week.
In addition, one of the counsellor's secretary and the chief of the local police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, a current human MP, in May of this year and until the age of the village, which, according to Cadena SER's research sources, could be the 'head' of the whole company.
The police continue to monitor the construction of the councils and the construction commission and no further arrests will be made in the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer Juan Morales, the chief suspect of corruption in the construction, was accused of having been discovered at the beginning of this week.
As Cadena SER, a lawyer from the 'lying' MP Juan Morales, who was examined yesterday, was arrested while leaving Morales' home with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, according to the research sources, the objective of investigating Morales' alleged selection is to provide for his signature of a building agreement with a Galician construction company, which has been reclassified 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people are detained.
Bono accepted the offer of a state in front of the Toledo candidate PSOE and, if they win, president of Congress
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the president of the government and the secretary-general of socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapatera to stand in future general elections in front of the PSOE (Spain's Labour Socialist Party) in Toleda and in the event that the socialists win general elections, he became president of Congress.
So at the press conference, the PSOE secretary announced to José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapater, which took place this afternoon in the federal headquarters of the party.
The chief of executives' bids to the former minister was justified by the fact that in political life "it is important to count with the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems," that this policy from La Manchy will be the candidate for the Socialist party to the President of Congress if the Socialists win in the upcoming elections.
Bono, as President of Congress, would replace Manuel Marín, who published his decision on 15 November in the next general elections and leave his active political career to fight climate change within the framework of university education.
The former minister admitted that the president of the government constantly insisted on him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He further stated that, as well as the citizens know who will be the Minister of Economic Affairs if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in "transparent form" who would chair the Congress.
If Bono gets this function, he hopes that Snow will turn into a "house of respect and not an indication or a cry" and that "it will become more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes, unfortunately, the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to speak peacefully and in peace is Congress, the President of the Government of the Senate on one occasion interrupted 26 times."
Similarly, he expressed his compliments at the address of the current President Manuel Marín and his "good work" and did not wish to imagine himself in his place so as not to diminish himself to what his opponents might think of as "great."
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is undermining the unmerciful pursuit of both those who look skeptically at its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles, it must be a firm demonstration of cohesion.
Moreover, the leader of the movement, who is the president of the government like Zapatero, believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign "a new treaty with the planet".
This proposal requires him to explain why his Government's activity or inaction has contributed significantly to Spain's leading in the European Union in the failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this failure in which sectors and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
In addition, it makes it clear to the Spanish what measures it intends to take in order to reverse climate change.
Which companies will be damaged, which population habits will have to change what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences this will have.
In other words, who sacrifices and who pays for saving the planet.
But we didn't expect such explanations, nor do we.
Just because you have to sacrifice yourself and pay.
Climate change measures, real measures, are unpopular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of gasoline, proposed by PSOE (Spain's Labour Socialist Party), seemed to Zapater so risky from the point of view of the election that he hurried to refuse it.
In other words, it is about saving the planet in such a way that nothing is missing, pure propaganda, passwords of any real importance.
Effective phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And by covenant with the planet, this man is so useful to an election campaign that he doesn't even speak, he doesn't demand, he doesn't demand, but he's a bribe, and he stirs up.
If it's limited to being just a virtual contractual party and not asking us to ride a bike and light up with a windshield.
Mayor and local police chief Totany detained for suspected corrupt practices in construction
As investigators reported, the Civil Guard arrested the old city of Totana, the "people" of José Martínez Andreo, head of local police, counsellor and one businessman in the hotel, for suspicion of committing criminal acts in the construction.
The mayor was arrested in his home and transferred to the council, where he is now located with a number of police officers who also delivered to the Commission for Construction and the City Enterprise for Industrial Lands and Apartments.
These three arrests came to the sixth, which took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in the operation associated with the reclassification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on the ground, suitable for the construction of the Galician company Nuaria, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last election period, to build 4,000 homes.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but were accused of being in court in the court of the first instance of Totana.
Six of the first prisoners were brought to court today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totany and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales is being investigated.
In addition, his former wife, the owner of the real estate office, was accused of being registered today in Totana and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous area.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, lawyer and businesswoman from Viga, was arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Immonaur, who belonged to that group and passed the charges.
The investigation is carried out by a group for criminal offences in the construction of the civilian central unit, whose members, other than arrest, also carried out eleven inspections, mostly in companies related to prisoners, with the headquarters of Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontever, Las Rozas (the province of Madrid) and Totany.
At that time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, a well-known owner of the company for the products of poultry meat that he could serve as a mediator.
The Nuaria Group was entrusted with the establishment of the largest residential complex in the city of Totany, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company received 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified and its project had to double the settlement of a village with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomoyar, which are dedicated to market support with properties, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coruná, Venezuela and in the town of Fernando el Católica in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.
And that's what happens.

Our Finnish writer sends us this comment from yesterday's edition of the most important Finnish news Helsingin Sanomat (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA report on world education), which refers to what the newspaper published on November 18th, on a tenth day when the circumstances there were also the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The subject of philosophy has emerged into public discussions in connection with the tragedy at school in Jokel.
The victim's murder, the high school student, quoted in his messages the work of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, a professor of education responsible for philosophy, asked on the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper to raise a critical view of Plato and claimed that it is not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the high basic course of philosophy at high schools."

One colleague informs about the introduction of a criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into criminal law:
A. Downloading a song would be a criminal act with a rate from six months to one year.
On the contrary, if you cut the plate at a price of less than 400 euros, it is considered a mere breach (§ 623.1).
B. If you print up to 1,000 euros in the store, theft is already a crime, but the criminal rate is lower than the charge (§ 234 of the criminal law).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than the charge (§ 244.1)
D. It's less important to take part in fights than changing compacts.
To participate in the extermination is the rate from three months to one year (§ 154 of criminal law) and for the exchange of compacts the rate from six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Law).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered under § 184.2 of the criminal law as less serious than downloading a film on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyright-protected films is punishable by vices rather than the provision of pornographic material to youth (§ 186).
So if my colleague's not wrong, she caught someone's hand, and that's right.

My curing doctor tells me one of his weird research articles called "Penízes cause brain activation, especially if others get less."
No pain that causes monthly payouts among employees depends on how much colleagues make.
The research was conducted at Bonn University using magnetic resonance tomography and the results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and leader of the study group Viewing the neurologic of Life&Brain in Germany: "The biggest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his colleague was wrong."
Research workers noticed that if both were successful, they would receive the same payment, the activation was modest, but when one received a double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The complainants of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been inseparably persecuted for eight years by the State Prosecutor of the Court of Justice in The Hague of the Balkan War.
Its mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, for the main culprits of the massacre in Srebrenica, where 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic are still free.
Their names are on the list, from which he took over the name of the documentary film by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin List" (2006, not mentioned in Spain), which, at the pace of the detective thriller, follows from Belgrade after New York, works by a Swiss prosecutor in the pursuit of refugee criminals and pressure on the relevant states to withdraw the network.
What kind of insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance, which protects the driver in the event of an accident, represents a significant expenditure that depends on various factors such as age, status, sex, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing a suitable car insurance is more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between insurance and insurance.
This commitment shall be in the form of an insurance contract which provides that the insurance undertaking will receive an agreed amount of insurance at a certain amount for taking over payment damage in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of insurance, which is determined with regard to the various factors such as age, status, sex, length of driving licence, type of vehicle which is insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the more likely the accident is to occur, the higher the insurance price.
For this reason, both persons aged 25 and women must pay lower insurance because statistics show that they have a lower risk index in view of their caution.
Similarly, on the basis of the checks, insurance companies concluded that persons living in a marriage have less accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of the journey, and thus the probability of an accident.
The increase in the frequency of the journey is likely to increase.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the insurance price.
Therefore, the driver must carefully examine the situation in order to choose which insurance is best suited to his insurance profile.
We will see here the most important variables for the choice of the type of insurance which, apart from issuing the type of insurance, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under 50 years of age are confronted with various disadvantages, such as little experience in driving and short driving when they want to sit securely at the available price.
Although it is ideal for good cover is insurance against all risks, there are also cheaper options.
Non-marketable drivers may choose insurance against all risks with low insurance in such a way as to obtain insurance coverage of all risks but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would presuppose the customer's participation in the insurance event.
"Part of the reward of the insurance event provided by the client will be determined in advance in determining the insurance price, which will be higher than the lower it would be involved in," explains Luis Noguera, the leading company of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is to extend insurance to other operating participants so that the client will ensure against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Recommendation.
If you are twenty-five years old, try to be careful and stop the accident as it is possible, because it will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce the insurance in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate of the insurance company.
On the contrary, the malaise is an increase in the said basic rate.
"Bonus and grandmother will depend on insurance and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, it could allow itself to increase the bonus," Noguera explains.
After crossing the border for twenty-five years, it is easier for drivers to sit in insurance because the customer’s risk index decreases because of the experience gained.
For this reason, it is recommended that all risks be covered by insurance.
"Young people are usually unable to benefit from the experience gained at the time of the accident, and not at the time of the trial," the director of the European company in Spain assures, and adds that most of the accidents occur in the second year of the trial, when the "fear of the novelty" has already been overcome.
However, if a client is married but has no children, it is better to sit in insurance against all risks if his economic situation permits.
Families with children are considered as clients with the lowest risk index and therefore their involvement will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a low insurance (which could make 300 euros) or at a high bonus, insurance extended to other operating participants shall start the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their management is calmer and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can allow themselves to get the highest discount," said Luis Noguera.
The pensioners are recommended to cover all risks with a reduced insurance (which represents EUR 150) or insurance extended to other operating participants if a high bonus has been achieved.
It is important to say that car insurance is almost important not only because it protects the driver in the event of a accident, but also because it represents a significant expenditure, which is the basis for a proper study of the possibilities of insurance that would most benefit us in view of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get to AC Milan point, which means Osmiffinal
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their forces this Tuesday at the San Siro stadium in an effort to get a point they lack to achieve their respective goals at the conclusion of the "Champions" league, because for Italy it would be the first and in Scotland it would decide to place it.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the process in the fifth remízo match in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but needs another one to be sure that Chessor will not get ahead of him with six points, who will play with Benfika, who has four.
These two group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as AC Milan has to play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where the first thirteen will arrive in the semifinals, in an attempt to move to the finals that are playing the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed before the other and decisive result at Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems to be most likely, even though both men will try to win, because the Italians will not want to tacticalize on the home ground and Celtic knows that after the win he would be the first and secure a better place in the eight-finals.
The men of Gordon Fearana could even get lost if Shakčor did not win, but could not rely on it, because at the same number of nine points the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1), but won in the first direct match (2:0).
And so AC Milan players will try to destroy the night of Scotts who believe that the second time they get to the semifinals in the reorganized Champions League just as they beat them in the same game in the last race of the Caká ball in the extension (1:0) after the status 0:0 in the base playing time.
Hope that they win the "rosoneri" will be the chessman for whom he has the prize of victory, only if Celtic loses, both for the course of the eight-finals, and for the defeat of UEFA.
Benfica, although it is the last and has no opportunity to continue in the highest European competition, could achieve a third place by one victory, so it would play in UEFA.
The first concert in the Spice Girls tour took place in Vancouver 20 000 people
The Spice Girls group started in Vancouver, Canada, before 20,000 spectators their first tour since it split in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place Stadium in Vancouver, they said that the reuniting of their group is "big".
About 20,000 people bought tickets to be present at a concert, which also included videos similar to the history of this group, which sparked a sensation at the end of the 1990s.
Returns and world tournaments are played at the same time as new albums are released by the EMI in Spain, which brings the choice of their main successful collections, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on the scene in a freshly decorated bracelet that their husband, "Posh Spice", was given by British footballer David Beckham.
This sportsman was in the audience that sailed GM Place, although nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Before the beginning of Victoria Beckham's performance, she said about the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he's thinking about the performance."
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the 1998 group "because of disagreements between us" caused a five-year-old group to be dissolved two years later, she also revealed her nervousness at meeting with reporters two hours before the beginning of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion has changed, the views on Spice Girls have changed.
And I thought, "Why not, so I'm glad I made my decision," Chisholm said about the reuniting of a group she had dissolved herself nine years ago.
The singer also noted that by the time process, "the masses have been balanced and we all love each other very much."
However, many things have changed since Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver by Virgin Airlines.
At the airport, an army of horses was expecting them.
Five has a total of 7 children.
After a concert in Vancouver, the group will be held in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
It will be held in Madrid on 23 December.
Supply from a new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
Russian-Ukraine gas prices are just being debated, and the risk of Russia's supply of this fuel to Western Europe is increasing.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is run by pipes across Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kyev warned that if Moscow raises Ukraine's gas prices, Russia will charge higher transit charges.
The previous dispute between these two last year has reduced deliveries to EU states.
The most recent dispute between Kyiv and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, strives to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says that Ukraine will have to account for more because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more than its Gazprom supplies.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in the course of the negotiations," said Ukrainian Minister of Economics Anatoly China.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges (to Western Europe) across Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev led to a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This led to a sharp drop in exports to Western Europe, leading to a sharp increase in prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of a supply to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas resources in the world, but most of them remain underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "needs to control foreign staff"
The controller said that the Scottish NHS Chambers must improve the control of criminal records among non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of the highest control office of Robert Black came after the foreign doctor acting in Scotland was linked to the June attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS has no accurate idea of the amount of foreign staff employed.
But his report stressed that other key controls were carried out in an orderly manner on the sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Control Office was concerned immediately after the June attacks at the Glasgow airport on personnel obtained from the country outside the European Economic Area.
Eighteen-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone hired Jeep at the front door of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a videotape charged with attempting to bomb in the United Kingdom.
The NHS Chamber is expected to monitor foreign personnel from the point of view of qualifications, experience and authorisation for work in the United Kingdom prior to their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commissions use the Scottish Disclosure Scotland for the control of criminal records, this agency has no power to obtain such information outside of Britain.
The report by the President of the Supreme Control Office, in addition to the recommendations that the Commission should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau guidelines, which assists employers with controls in several countries.
"Although we have found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly," the report announced.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish NHS is in many respects consistent with its own pre-employees' policy, but added: "Our report points out areas in which the system could be improved in order to ensure the availability of accurate information on the quantity of foreign personnel."
The president of BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry, said that it is "very unlikely" that pre-employee controls would identify potential employees of NHS who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report indicates that current pre-employee controls in the Scottish NHS work well and it is not clear what further value those comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the Supreme Control Office pointed out that these numbers would probably also be higher because the Commission should have had a problem identifying staff with a residence permit.
The investigation also found that the control procedures introduced by the NHS authorities in the Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely implemented.
They included checks on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently recasting the pre-employee controls policy and directive for NHS foreign workers.
Nicola Sturgeon's Ministry of Health said, "I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She also added that the Scottish Government, in agreement with the Health Commissions, considers the recommendations of this report and will ensure that the best practices are found in the updated pre-employment controls of all staff - including those of the foreign - who are planning to issue next month.
Joy Division Controls Film Prices
Control, a animated film about the retired singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five prizes at the British Independent Film Awards, including prizes for the best film.
The prizes also won the Sam Riley star, who worked to the role of Curtis in the warehouse, director Anton Corbín and later to Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named the best actress for the thriller Scandal.
And the star of Daniel Craig's bondo has won the Variety Award for getting a British movie on the world stage.
Prices were celebrated in London's Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis' journey to glory with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - stood only 3 million pounds.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbinov, formerly known for his iconic package album U2 Joshua Tree, two prizes - for the best regime and for the best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another rated - because Juliena Temple film about the singer Clash Joe Strummer received the price for the best document.
The record for the best player was won by Viggo Mortensen as the leader of the Russian Mafia boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg Eastern Betrayal.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation for the role of hard guys, won Richard Harris' prize for an extraordinary benefit to the British film.
This 50-year-old, including Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is now filming another part of Indiana Jones - Kingdom of the crystal skull.
Winston said he's proud of this price, which is named after Camelot's star and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
Independent film prices, known as Biffs, are awarded by the jury, where filmmakers, actors and festival organizers are present.
Between the stations and Bif patterns are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Evan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbott.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for terrorist attacks
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for membership in the cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities and also on spiritual and security components.
State television by the largest exporter of oil reported that one of the cells wanted to inject rockets into the country.
The supporters of al-Qaida led a campaign against the monarchy, the United States' allies, from 2003 to the invasion of Iraq.
The TV report announced that the cell of eight militants led by a foreigner was planning an attack on oil plants in the province of Ash-Sharkiyah.
Saudi Arabia has a rapid response unit to the force of 35,000 members to defend the equipment from the unfavourable attack of al-Qaida on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal declaration: 18 arrested belonged to a cell led by "expert on rocket firing", which he landed in the country.
She also stated that the militants were planning to pass eight shots into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare the killings of spiritual and security workers.
The government urged the clergy to try harder to prevent Saudis from going to Iraq to join the Al-Qaeda militants fighting the joint forces and the Shishak government supported by the United States, which the conservative Sunni of Saudis consider to be a caste.
Al-Qaeda militants believe that the authorities have hired many spiritists in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that governs the government.
Militants - supported by the challenges of the leader of al-Qaeda Saúda Usám bin Ládina to focus on the Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort of security forces in the past... five months," the Ministry of Interior said to state television.
A 16-year-old "medial cell" was also arrested in Medina, which was intended to promote "takfirian thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which promotes violence against Muslims marked as unbelievers and apostates.
There were also 32 prisoners accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus is perhaps a view of the future of the Earth
Scientists yesterday announced that Venus could ever be a pleasant place to live.
Data from the current European station show that the planet is even more similar to the Earth's own twins than it once thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to the Earth.
These two worlds are almost as big as they are, and they go around similar jewels, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus had conditions similar to those on Earth and could also be inhabited.
But the announced greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and the lower rate of rotation sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today the planet is water-free, the temperature on the surface is hot enough on the roof of the lead and it's released by storms and winds about the force of the hurricane.
The findings of the Venus Express European Space Agency, which has studied the planet for one year, offer a close look at how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Academy of Physics of Oxford University and one of the leading Venus Express missions said: "It's much clearer why the climate on Venus is different than on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data enables us to draw up a scenario in which Venus began as well as the Earth, perhaps with a population environment, billions of years ago."
The police kept the "riched uranium"
Kilo of radioactive material, supposedly enriched uranium, was detained yesterday by the Slovenian and Hungarian police.
The police spokesman stated that three people were detained and the material was examined.
He did not claim to be a enriched uranium, but said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Still in touch
Mitt Romney said that it is not appropriate for presidential candidates to answer snowfall questions.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates later agreed with the debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions to the video and handed them over to the outgoing candidates.
None of the questions sent on Wednesday 28 November were as comic as a snowfall, which asked the democracies to global warming in the debate of the other party on YouTube.
But questions and even answers this time reflected the position of the Republican Party towards elections next year.
It is not clear how exactly CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, chose the clips that were then shown by aspiring candidates.
But the first half of the debate, the longest time devoted to the only topic, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the most powerful Republican themes.
CNN asked the panel of undecided voters to turn around with a cat when they heard something comforting: the voters noted the tops of agreement when the candidates talked about hard access at the borders.
The strongest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr. Romney, who was released in the key rapid votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani is trying to establish the reputation of a man who was as prime minister of New York soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hireing illegal immigrants to work at his home.
These two were particularly welcome when the hostages asked whether some of the candidates would support "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants a normal position and the possibility of citizenship).
Further candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Congressman from Colorado, have been able to add their little to the mill on this subject.
None of these two have a chance to be nominated, but they both remain in the game, perhaps because they started to beat up for immigration sooner and stronger than the others.
At least on immigration, candidates have a similar view: greater rigour on borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, together with concerns about Chinese toys and other concerns about the world around it, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the conflict between libertines and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very unpleasant when it came to other issues.
Mr Giuliani was asked why in the past he supported holding the gun.
John McCain and Mr. Romney were discussing whether the simulated heat technique should be considered torture.
One secretary asked if the candidates believed every word from the Bible.
This led Giuliani to conclude that even though the Bible is his favorite book, it probably does not literally believe the story of Jonah and the worship.
Another hostage asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all assumptions in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa due to his long-term Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, Jesus said that he was too smart to run for what he used to laugh.
The fight remains unusually open.
The growth of Mr. Huckbee in Iowa is covered by recent successes in the acquisition of money and the vocal joy of Ron Paul in the middle debate.
These two have declined from the bottom because both sides are still unable to agree on more familiar and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates joined the party very quickly and convincingly with a win report on American size on the lips, marking both sides.
This time, the party is disbanded and the result is far from consistent.
Labourer’s Disease
Gordon Brown again found a trap he might fall into; his journey remains the same.
Although it is customary for British political scandals, it is not particularly spicy.
It does not seem that any rules would be sold, no bills in the Paris hotel were secretly paid, no extra-marriage rings would be charged.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would hang without revealing that a wealthy businessman in four years' time masked the contributions of the government of the Labour Party of 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million) on behalf of other people, and that the party did not declare it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided the election and insulted the British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not affected by research, there was hope that it would ensure a robust and effective government.
Instead of formulating it as much as the more funny representative president of the Liberal Democrats, Mr. Brown ever changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unencouraging rescue of the Northern Rock problem bank showed weaknesses in management and a chaotic judgment under the fire.
Wrong-thinking proposals for a change in tax law have been linked to companies against the government together.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has revealed unimaginable administrative fraud.
Three generals in retirement started a rebellion in the Lord's Chamber; protested against the armed robbery, for they claimed that being a commander of armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are many gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the secretary - general of the laborers (and their former guardian of the inner discipline), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown would point to his end in an irrefutable way.
Even so, governments can reach a point of overlap, under which they find rulership difficult.
People don't believe in politicians, and they don't like them, but most of the time, they take away their trust when we take over a new party.
When it seems clear that a prime minister probably won't do anything better, and he doesn't have to be in the office for a long time, this is the departure: the government becomes a bully, the ministers are starting to do briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one way, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because, contrary to other political leaders, he cannot take the position of a new basket.
Whatever he'd like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the accounts of the financial authority are linked to the decisions that Mr Brown made as Minister of Finance.
And even though he wasn't directly involved in the blaroon painters, such as long-term investigation into the financing of political parties caused by "values for money", voters can quietly conclude that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's hatred is not as bad as they look.
Those gears aren't as horrible as the conservatives do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or was exposed to delusion.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm and easy brutal government.
The latest gap around political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Garboid Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says that he did not want any publicity for his goodness.
That may be true, but the decision was not on him.
The laws against the anonymous of major political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about the procedure of Mr. Abrahams, but did not know that he was illegal, will certainly be thoroughly heard; likewise Jon Mendlesohn, the main laborer of the money that he learned about the broken gifts in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not at all involved; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these birds, even though the main part of the payment was going through until his appearance in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the job.
He quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but made his decision by seeking a certified instrument, the committee to investigate this matter, which was also led by the bishop in retirement and the judge.
In this case, training is not complicated.
If the law was violated, it's about the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as find a permanent president independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has no one for six months, and act as a real reform of the financing of political parties.
This would require laborers who are in close cooperation with the conservative and perhaps give up their special financial relationship with the committees - bitter pills for a dedicated party, such as Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The conservatives now have a good start in the research; he has two years to get back the voters; and the only way to win is unmistakable integrity and high competence.
Carnets
Does the crisis affect the US credit card market?
When it's in the water, naturally, they're starting to blow up the back of the ship.
Now that the American real estate market is on the rise, the predators have focused on the darker credit card market.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs say that losses on credit cards would be worth $99 billion if other variants of consumer loans were imposed from the sub-locate.
The voltages are visible.
An increase in the number of cases of inability to pay (for more than 30 days of late payment) and of written accounts (accounts considered by the supplier to be ineligible).
The HSBC bank announced last month that it had lost $1.4 billion on the US consumer credit market - also due to non-solvent loans on credit cards.
But he's panicked so soon.
The savings and inability to pay are still low.
According to the evaluation agency Moody's was 3.89% of the rate of incapacity for payment in the third quarter almost the entire percentage point on average.
Decreasing levels may be partially explained by technical reasons.
The 2005 U.S. Personal Bankruptcy Act has led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcy which makes much of the credit card losses; thus, the number of deposits (and thus the number of write-offs) would fall regardless of whether the general conditions for the borrowers had deteriorated.
The sector also shows a good balance of payments, which shows how many consumers pay monthly out of their debts.
And trust in securities secured by credit cards is strong, even through paralysis in other aspects of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup research company predicts that the volume of their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than the waves.
Direct roads for the spread of infection between the crises of secondary mortgages and the credit card market definitely exist: when loans for real estate are dried up, consumers are more indebted to credit cards.
Credit card issuers, however, tend to look at cash flows rather than the value of handling items, so falling home prices do not necessarily mean a change in the confidence of lenders.
They can even be beneficial to the lenders.
The incentives for consumers to pay mortgages are reduced when the value of their property is reduced by the value of the loan; consequently, the debt on the cards is moved up on the list of priority to pay.
The issuers shall also be able to react more quickly and more flexibly to the stormy conditions than the mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid changes in the prices of hand-held items.
"It doesn't happen that we'd just reassess all the loans in one beautiful morning," says Gary Perlin, the financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of explosions in the form of low secondary mortgages, the risk of progressive weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card sector will face a darker future.
Watch out for those ridges.
British bankers admitted guilt in Enron's case
Three British bankers, who were to be tried for their role in the fraud associated with the former financial leader Enron Andrew Fastew, changed their statement and admitted their guilt on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially blamed seven accusations of fraud, when they were supposed to participate in the financial fraud in 2000 -- to be rich on account of their employers -- refused.
They were supposed to be in January before the trial.
However, during the trial before US periodic judge Ewing Werlin Jr., everyone admitted to one deception.
The case of these three former leading employees of Greenwich NatWest, the units of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was on the front pages for the entire two years that lasted on the issue.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of the investigation initiated after Enron's border in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 were pointed out by Mr Fastow that it was the objective of a government investigation into Enrona's coast.
The complaint against the bankers -- who served as "NatWest Three" -- claims that in 2000 they came to Houston to invent a fraud together with Fastow and his former chief cousin Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partner branch controlled by Fastow, who was an architect of a lot of enronic lies that Enron looked at in a spirit of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its share in this section zero, but our three British knew that it had a significant value in fact.
The company under Kopper's control bought a share of the bank in this box for $1 million.
Incriminating bankers paid Kopper a share of $250,000 in this company.
According to Fastow's complaint, Enron misinformed that the energy company will pay 20 million dollars for its share in this branch of Greenwich NatWest.
However, those 20 million actually went to British bankers, Fastowi and others.
Bankers reportedly received 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and others fined around $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted his guilt in two cases of conspiracy for his role in the destruction of Enron.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in the federal prison in Louisiana.
Copper's been in prison for three years and a month in a Texarkan facility.
All three British have moved to the bailout for $1 million, which has ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, fell into bankruptcy in December 2001 after the years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions of debts or show misleading speculation as profit.
The collapse has abolished thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion of market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
The founder of Enrona Kenneth Lay and former chief employee Jeffrey Schilling were convicted last year for their role in the collapse of society.
Schilling is in execution of more than 40 years of punishment.
Judgments over Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other accusations were eliminated after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow Non-Power
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine, with enough fuel for a nonstop flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is small to return.
"He can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of the Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in so many places, because it is for a close family or a firm president."
Mr. Firer sat in the Gulfstream station last Friday at the Millionary Exhibition, which is the four-day orgy of consumption shown in the mother exhibition centre on the periphery of the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, its stands were built over 200 other luxury suppliers, who hoped that freshly rich Russians would lean on everything from the mahogany jackets made of diamond-made car trailers, which would not be worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer took a careful look at the clear orange Porsche in the next stop.
"It's a nice car, but it's against us, the pennies and the tenaires," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
On the waves of the oil, the money goes to the Russian capital, just like he had his days in Dallas.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans greatly enriched and moved to Europe, where they looked at them as materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at Davis's Russian and Euro-Asian study center at Harvard.
As well as Saudi explorers from the 1970s and the 1990s, the Russians become the most prominent losers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for this Klondike.
In another place in Moscow this week, the conference of the luxury industry Donatell Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of the LVMH Group, came to the conference to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods on the markets like the Russian one.
(The Conference organises The International Herald Tribune, which owns The New York Times Company.)
Russia has a list of the richest people in Forbes magazine 53 billion with a total of $282 billion.
In addition, the local main institute in the field of Center for Economic and Financial Research has reported on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103 000 "cooperative" millionaires in Russia, whose total assets amount to $670 billion.
(The World Bank indicates that in 2005 15.8% of the Russians lived below the limit of the existing minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of the London clergy, David Morris.
She was at the fair first, along with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are unrecorded, and men are all for the full name."
When they went through the evening dress on Sunday night halls, Evgenia Yumatov's one and a half years old Svetlana Turovcov's herself and her clients marked as a millionaire.
"I was looking at the cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatov, who was dressed as a veteran of red carpets, with which Joan Rivers looks like a domestic cat.
The Fairrh seemed to be focused primarily on fresh, brand-controlled Russian buyers who are willing to spend a few hours in road traffic in order to be able to go through the warehouse, which blends the Cadillacy Escalade in crystal, platinum fishing, the freezing of Mövenpick, the culinary tables in peace, apartments in Dubai, gowns and bridges.
Members of the free public could buy tickets for EUR 30 ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was patriotic about the position of the Dutch producer of the Royal Delft porcelain before the reproduction of Rembrandt's image from the hand painted blue pieces in a vivid size.
"Of course, the Russians are interested in more gold."
And, in fact, here sellers say that Russians with old money (according to the Russian measurements are 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from the flash logs to a few well-known limited editions that would never appear on the shopping fair.
Even a few thousand people, whether they're millions, sending millions, or simply tourists, have been flooded by fireworks every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ersov, the local general manager of King Koil's bed, introduced that he sold two matrices of silk, cashmere and cotton, carved with gold yarns, for $70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, a sales manager of A1 Moto, who has high-end car high-end alarms that his company has clearly sold orange Porsche for $170 000 to the Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, who manages luxury cars to sell three net to cars in the style of linked chain straps for Rolls-Royce Phantomy for $55,000.
He showed the reporter the car round designed for the Russian casino owner, who had the escape drawn by the Swarovsk crystal so it looked like a roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"The Russian millionaire who wants a wheel from a pig's skin or a portrait of his wife from a circular circus doesn't have to ride on those wheels yet," said Karapetian.
"He'll put them in his garage in thirty-four cars."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" at present does not mean anything very exclusive, given the large increase in the prices of these properties.
"If you bought yourself three or four years ago in Moscow's apartment, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least imagine wealth at the station operated by the Russian Federation Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company invented four red British-style telephone booths carved out by false banknotes worth millions of dollars.
Aszad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, stated that his team had printed 500,000 fake bankers for the Millionaires.
They stopped to spread around a bunch of money, or to let their friends take a picture of their mobile phone, as they rest in the middle of their spare wealth, or just cut out a couple of millions.
"You know, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by a damaged operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows at the restaurant about something healthier and followed the health care that came to the white New England house with two houses below West Scott Avenue.
The car was soon connected to the police station.
And then another one.
"But I saw the delivery of a doctor," said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant controller.
"At the moment I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found out that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41 years old, the executive assistant director of the Norwegian Police Department.
The investigators are now trying to determine whether she died due to the procedure of an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at the house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet ascertained what caused Miss Arroy's death, and they hope that the toxicological tests, whose results must not be known for weeks, will help resolve the mysterious death that had sent the wave of grief to the head of the NGO police.
Ms. Arroy has been an assistant police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, cheerful and hard-working," said Mr. McCarthy about Miss Arroy in a phone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She'd protect me."
Mr McCarthy pointed out that Ms. Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former NYPD officer who works for the Commission to control alcoholic beverages, and that she left two sons behind at the age of 14 and 11 and a daughter of her own.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the Union, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to find out if Ms. Arroy died of the consequences of unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the options," said Mrs. Walsh.
"The investigation is still under way."
The authorities indicated that they had arrived at the house about three o'clock in the afternoon.
November and found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was declared dead.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is supposed to be Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if the authorities heard from Miss Castro.
The investigators are trying to determine if the part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday in Miss Castro's house, with a ruined pink hat in the front garden and Dalmatian climbing back, no one answered.
Next to the door that led to the shop, a blue bar with the title "Ethyl Vanillin" was found in the open garage, which is used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
On one side she hung two mountain wheels.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in the New York Police Department in Newark, Ms. Arroy gave him invaluable assistance in the investigation of his new city's ugly and bold political culture.
"She said, 'You should take care of this or this,' he said.
"She was always here when I came, and she was here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hope that the Fed reduces interest rates, leads to the strengthening of world stock exchanges
The prices of the shares on both sides of the Atlantic had jumped yesterday after the market hopes that the Federal Bank would try to calm the lending conditions by further lowering interest rates, were strengthened by the reassuring statements of the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The burs jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in line with Ben Bernanke, President of the Fed, said that in response to the continuing pressure on financial markets, there must be "flexible and pragmatic" drivers.
In a clear effort to calm the distorted markets in the midst of the symptoms of the life-threatening credit institutions, Mr. Kohn said that recent awakenings "partly resulted in some improvement in the functioning of the markets by the end of September and October".
He further stated that if the increased instability persists, the possibility that the financial conditions of households and companies will continue to worsen will be increased.
The investors consider these years to be a signal that Fed is ready to add additional fresh rates of capital to the US market, and perhaps further lower interest rates to stabilise credit conditions.
These comments also helped calm Wall Street in the midst of other bad news about the American economy when the sale of apartments in October showed record low numbers.
The results of the financial faith were supported by the announcement by Bear Stearns of the investment bank that it will abolish 650 jobs, which are 4% of its world labour force, in the context of reducing costs for compensating heavy losses caused by unannounced reliance on the provision of secondary housing loans in America.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will be destroyed in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed to 13,289,40, while the more used S&P 500 increased by 2,65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165,5 percent, or 2.7 percent, and ended at 6,306.2, with the British blue-chips rising by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index grew by 2.6% and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3%.
Some time ago, the market credit stress showed itself in full power after the European Central Bank loaned these funds to European commercial banks at a rate of 4,7 %, which is the largest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release excess money on the London monetary markets has increased by the fact that the three-month UK interbank loans "Libor" amounted to 6,59 per cent after uninterrupted growth since 12 November to its maximum from the end of September.
England has to decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas here, one as hard as the other.
Who's going to be the number six on England's thumb this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in the broader context of nothing less relevant than the first Sri Lankan Test, who is to make this decision?
The second question is that David Graveney, the chairman of the electoral committee, who is holding the best in this position at the time borrowed, has Peter Moores, the chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the aid decision and because the Hugh Morris table, the chief manager of the English team, starts to apply to the national electoral team, not necessarily to the full commitment.
Whoever's not built on the sixth place on the stake will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport no longer.
It is not easy to find what one will get at the top of his profession, while one will never get over the lower level, sometimes due to a lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in the cricket is the choice challenging and requires a judgment that must always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, if not?
In the same way we could ask ourselves in another area, let's say that here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Bannerjee, both smart young leading workers with good education and a review in the field, should be raised to the Commission - the place is for one.
Who's supposed to say what level is right for the cricketer when he can't afford to drop or swim on the next one?
Of course, they have great influence on decision-making, but they also have the same opportunities.
In the team, the cricketer must capture the captain's view at the right time, if he is to take the wicket, and the thumb needs regular chances at the starting positions, if ever he is to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the sampler's view is more complicated.
For example, during the last season, James Anderson, whose place in the first test, seemed to be much better, even if Stephen Harmison had declared himself a healthy and well - known workman.
Anderson took 32 tickets in the first class at 33 crossings each.
Chris Tremlett took at the same modest average only 29, but they both had their moments at the highest level and hoped in the next.
If he's playing at the Asgiriya Shah Stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice may affect or affect both careers, or it does not have much effect.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in each test and in the first class gave good performances, five wickets and 40 trips, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who finally became a stable Test Cricket, who was also, although in Australia against Australia, scored twice, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion on today's training, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience in the presence of Bopar's youth.
There are arguments for both.
For Shaha, he speaks of his curved and valuable debut test shifts at 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundred in the first class opposite the six Boparov, which is, in twenty years, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin uppers.
However, Shah made in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in Testu na Lord's, his home play in Middlesex, only ten passes, and that, along with the immediate rejection of the voters, when Vaughan wanted to re-suspension him for another match, his fire seemed to be wearing something out of the elan that was so evident in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex University has the joy of living in the bones.
At the cricket scene, he has nothing to do with him and his behavior outside the scene symbolizes a recently turned car with a drive of four wheels on the exhibition day of the English team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He got out with a slight injury and a lot of shock, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his partner, who was watching it all the time to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its medium-speed smile uppers on the left-hand games that seem to fit, give away effectively and fire with self-conscious and handy.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe it's the real art of choice.
Personally, I'm trying to get Bopara to get his chance now, which, of course, I don't want to say that Shah won't excel if, as the Cylon tea leaves indicate, he's the one who's gonna play next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began to come to Baghdad yesterday and to pour out the escapes that came with the money or expired the visa period, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the armed men who had expelled them from their homes.
The Mansur bus station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in the official government convoy on a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubajsi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the papers, for what was done in Baghdad and how it's safe now.
"They say that the Mahdi army stopped killing people," said he meant the Shishak militia militia of the militant Muktadi al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Kasim al-Atwani, an eight-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni Region of Amaria, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the darker regime did not allow the Iraqis to work.
His former neighbor in the United States called him by the fact that the local militia with the support of the American army helped to push Al-Qaeda out of her position in the west of the capital, and they insisted that he return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite village, whose home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad escaped the grenade attack after he forced his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"The president called me a few friends and told me that he was going to Sleikh to the militia against al-Qaeda and that he needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said twenty-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many spoke of the attractiveness of reconciliation in the capital after strengthening the American military presence and the growth of the local "group of busy citizens", which armaments on the side of the American army defend their quarter.
But it has been more about the fact that they have been forced to return to the obstacles around visas and the loss of money in Damascus, where over 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a father of three children, voiced his suspicions shared among refugees that Núri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the visa of refugees and thus accepted them back.
According to the available data, more than two and a half million people fled from the Iraqi sectarian murders.
"It was all right before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressed the government to stop giving the Iraqis a visa to have to go back to Iraq," the Sunnitian resident said.
"I can't believe the government that supports the criminals who burned me out of my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the weakening of violence is the fact that the suns were pushed out of the Shiite regions and on the contrary, which reduces tensions in many places.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will revitalize the sectarian tension and lead to another battle.
Small Sarsko, good education
Germany's smallest collegiate country plays a leading role in vocational education, even excels the international focus of its high schools.
In only one educational area, Sarko is concerned with the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"A man who does not come from Sarska, I explained yesterday at the age of fifty that we are not French" - this self-irronic password appears in Sarska on posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birth of this smallest sex country.
However, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarah education system, which is in the monitoring of the Colin Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place.
High schools have traditionally been working closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by France.
Until now, students can finish the study with a double or even three-thirds degree.
This corresponds to a relatively high proportion of foreign students, which represents 15.6 %.
For the average number of Sarah’s children is to be admitted to high school - many of them even without a university degree.
"In Sarska, a professional education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, an IW educational expert.
By obtaining more than five young people's rights to study at the university, Sarsko is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared with the rest of Germany, Sarsk has a rich opportunity to combine practical and academic education.
The opportunities to study two sectors are the second best in Germany, given the number of inhabitants.
In the past years, the number of third-party engineering graduates has declined in terms of practical education and rising demand.
The Serbian Ministry of Education has now ordered high schools to create a promotion campaign in the engineering fields.
"After the first study of the Scriptures, we conducted several reforms in general education schools," says the Ministry of Education spokesman.
That's why the government has conducted comparative tests throughout Germany.
For children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of the mother’s school is free - a model that takes over other sex countries.
If the results of the students are significantly improved, they will show up to the future comparative study.
In 2003 the proportion of pupils at risk decreased from 29 % to 20 %.
In general, however, Sarsko did not improve as much as the other sex countries.
The barbers can count better.
And to the disappointment of Sarska study Pisa does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Sarska would be able to stop in this area.
The language of the neighbors is mandatory in the gymnasiums - even though the inhabitants of Sarska are not French.
Chavez moves hours
What they don't see will be hours in Venezuela other than the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will move the hours back to this South American country about half an hour.
In Spain, between Chávez and Chávez, there is a funny figure.
Venezuela's official letter reported that the hours under the new law against world time would be reduced by less than four and a half hours.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chávez, the enemy of the United States, has also justified his decision, inter alia, by the fact that the United States has spent hours in the division of the world's time zones.
In the middle of the local time, Chávez also announced that due to the case with the arms, he is interrupting relations with neighboring Colombia.
This left-wing nationalist has declared that while conservative Alvaro Uribe is President of Colombia, he will not have any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"I can no longer, for my own sake," said Chávez, who advocates the reform of the constitution, which citizens of this oil country must vote on in the Sunday referendum.
This reform would greatly strengthen Chávez's power in the country.
It was the Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels about the release of arms.
Uribe, in his decision, Venezuela, criticized Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is also talking about Chavez.
The new mobile call here caused a stir: "Why don't you callas?" (Why don't you shut up?) - that sounds like a sentence that has already been downloaded from the Internet by more than half a million people.
The Spanish King Juan Carlos spoke of it, who, at the recent Ibero-American summit, was so disillusioned that he was silenced.
Germans are at risk of lower payouts in 2007.
According to the forecast, this year the German employees are threatened with a reduction in real wages even through a strong economic downturn.
Experts have reasoned on their pessimistic forecast for a number of reasons.
According to estimates, in 2007, people employed can actually count on getting lower wages than last year.
"The wine is accompanied by a small increase in payments, an increase in the value added tax and an increase in prices for food and energy," said Bild Gustav Horn of the Institute of Research IMK (Institut für Macroenomy und Konjunkturforschung).
New burdens on employees may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück, Newsman Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung, said that the new year's planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Social Labour Agency should no longer face such difficulties as to require loans or contributions from young people, quoting the social democratic policy.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion of food and oil products has avoided inflation in its highest state in the last thirteen years.
In the annual price comparison, the total price rose by three percent.
Venus is a hell of a double Earth.
Over his life, the enemy atmosphere of Venus Earth is more similar than ever before. The European space probe Venus Express on Venus recorded the effects that occur also in the winter on the Earth: lightning in the atmosphere and wind faith in the fields.
For almost three decades, scientists have believed that it is on Venus.
Now the Venus Express European probe has brought evidence - it has captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, the lightnings fly from darkness to darkness, about 56 kilometers high, wrote in the science magazine Nature Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to the well-known theory of the origin of the original mass, life could be created on Earth by the lightnings. The storms reportedly emerged in the oceans of reaction that led to the creation of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
It wasn't like, "If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of Carnegie Institute in Washington.
The atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"Venuše is perhaps the hell twins of the Earth, but it's the twins," said Russell.
Why did Venus, which is so much like Earth and size, begin to develop completely differently, is the basic issue of the Esa mission.
In view of the fact that since the beginning of the 1990s no probe was sent exclusively for the purpose of the Venus study, the launch of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was in the research of this planet as a milestone.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which approached several articles in Nature magazine, did not highlight the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more like Earth than it has ever been predicted," Esa said.
In addition to the already known windmills in the North Pole, scientists have found a darker belief in the South Pole, which is much faster.
This phenomenon resembles air currents in the northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piconi from the Italian Institute Institute of Astrofisica Spaciale e Physics Cosmica.
The second inner planet of our solar system forms almost the same mass as Earth, and with an average of 12 100 km it is almost as large.
This planet, marked as the Jitřenka or Vecernica, will surround the Sun in a total of 225 days.
However, around its own axis, it turns a lot slower. One day on Venus takes 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not remember the surface temperature of 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bars on Earth, scientists believe that both planets are created under very similar conditions.
And the waters were piled up on the two, and the earth was in the seas, while the waters were flowing out of Venus.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalajlamu
Spolko President Köhler asks for the closure of the party disputes for the adoption of the branch office.
SPD was directly criticised for her attacks on the office after a meeting in September.
Spolko President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and calls for a large coalition to end the struggle around the adoption of the Dalajlams.
"We should not present ourselves as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler said to the commercial newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision by the German office of Angely Merkelov (CDU) to accept the Dalajlam in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity to me," Köhler said.
The Social President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but this did not prevent the Merkels from stopping when it was calculated that they were creating a new policy towards China.
"The local office has not left China's traditional policy.
China also knows," Köhler said.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) made his disagreement directly with the acceptance of the Dalajlams, and was attacked by a number of coalitions.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the "preparation" foreign policy of the coalition.
After we got into the office, German-Chinese relations broke out.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but, according to SPIEGEL, it also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the ministries abroad.
The Chinese president of the Wen Jiabao government called on Angel Merkel's office to admit that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama showed that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas, which are also located in the territory of China, is trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns against similar troubles that broke out in France
Street battles with police, gunshots, fuelled cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar disturbances that exploded in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social unhappiness in Germany does not increase in street violence, the social minister calls for it inside.
The barricades burned, the miners shot at the police. After serious youth troubles in France, the social minister, inner Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is concerned about similar developments in Germany.
"We must pay attention to the fact that social tensions are not created by us as well as by violence.
We have to take this seriously," News Press said in the ANN.
Not every young person is able to balance itself with a rapid change in social reality.
The local government, the country and the country are already working hard to remove the problems, Schäuble said.
Which means not only the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit after the conference on Islam we record the first success."
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble at the same time pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
In the past few nights, youth with police in the northern suburbs of Paris fought hard street fights.
Even in Toulouse, she burned cars and public buildings.
More integration efforts by the German government demanded the president of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the problems in France, Kolat warned against "stimulating effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
However, it should be done.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from the migrant family is the unemployment rate of "averagely high".
Above all, it is necessary to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat stressed, "We have to give youth hopes."
But the president of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany there is more social control of families than in France.
In addition, many young people from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, "But we have to be careful."
We need to enable young people to work and learn quickly.
In the meantime, the night at the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained very quiet.
In the setting, hundreds of policemen and over the area flew over a helicopter with a lightbulb.
The authorized authorities reported three arrests and several burned garbage and cars.
Since yesterday, there have been about 1,000 armed forces.
The police will intervene as long as it is necessary, announced after a visit by the Ministry of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie.
In trouble at Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night.
The following night, Toulouse's troubles were over.
An accident caused a weekly traffic accident in which two young people found themselves living.
According to the initial findings of the state representation, there is no blame on the police for the deaths of young people.
In Angely's "Oblakové"
The office's actually a remote output shows that the coalition is programmed at the end and that we can't expect anything more from it.
What country does this office actually live in?
After her unhappily, depressing, and indiscriminately poor speech on the General debate of the Spolkov Snow, we must find that not here - not in this country, which she should finally manage.
In view of the fact that he is too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel answered once very arrogantly.
It's provincial, she said, which showed she doesn't want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the Shadow, she clearly showed how much she deserved this lesson.
Merkel had no real interest in anything, but a sense of country problems.
Instead, Angela "Oblakova" was presented: a politician who wins over the others who sneezes into foreign politics and even speaks only in a sneezy way.
For example, climate protection: without delay, they praise the conclusions coming from the Summit in Heiligendam, but they no longer say how the climate objectives are to be achieved in Germany.
And yet, such self-respect - so much incomprehension would be forgiven by the president of the CDU two years ago.
It is now limited to the planned phrases that could increase its profile among people.
This approach damages its image of pragmatics, which does not need to be shaken because problems are solved.
But in Angely's "Oblakova" reign, internal political problems are territorial issues.
Children's poverty and care for people with low wages?
A few extra words on these topics have been left to her.
It's worth noting how often Merkel's, when it comes to children's supplements, is saying, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Three times Merkel has to start from the beginning, so that she can speak at least part of the correct sentence.
As soon as things start to become very specific, it's like a completely foreign field.
Department of Attack
The debate of the Republic's presidential candidates on YouTube in the case of the favourites of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney has been debated in the course of the debate - and both must now be concerned about the external candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already on the first topic.
Mitt Romney predicts to his opponent Rudy Guilianim that he has made New York an "unlawful asylum".
Giuliani reacts quickly with harsh remarks: "I assume that his own house was just one such shelter," he replies and predicts to former governor Massachusetts that he has employed immigrants in particular without evidence.
Since the Republican Foundation has no clear preference so far, eight presidential candidates use these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their competitors.
A half-minute, internet-based video sent through Youtube serves only as a key theme tip.
"This is exactly the policy of isolationism that we have enabled Hitler to understand the power," John McCain predicts to his rival Ron Paul, who as the only one advocates immediate deployment of the armies from Iraq.
Vietnamese veteran McCain doesn't check with either Romney or Romney for refusing to condemn the torture method of questioning called Waterboarding, where heat is simulated.
The reaction of the public in St. Petersburg shows that there is no war in Iraq or torture.
The commitment shall be accompanied by a notice whenever conservative values are raised and the future increase of the data is prohibited.
That's how it shows where the weaknesses lie.
"I was wrong once," explains Romney's criminality and asks for a page-based and television audience for forgiveness because he was still in 1994 for the execution of kidnappings.
Giuliani is in despair when he is asked to express himself in a literal way.
The First Ruler of Civilian Government
On the day after his resignation from the position of Chief Commander of the Army, Pakistani ruler Musharraf made a presidential oath.
This will end eight years of military government in Pakistan.
On Thursday, the President of Pakistan, Parvíz Musaraf, made a presidential oath, and will be in the President's office for another five years.
Pakistan's television broadcasts live a ceremony held in the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
The man swore he would respect the constitution and strive for a good nation.
On Wednesday, his Office of the Chief Commander of the Army handed over to his assistant Ashfang Kiyanim, who was subjected to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he gained power in a bloodless military coup, the government's former general first as the civilian head of the state.
With his resignation from the position of Chief Commander of Armed Forces, Musharraf met one of the main requirements of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional status declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to High State Representative Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will abolish the exceptional status soon after his oath, and thus meet the other requirements of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which, following the declaration of an exceptional status at the beginning of November, held by its adjudicated lawyers, rejected all objections to the contested re-election of the State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in an attack on a military convoy in the northern part of the country, and four others were injured.
The Speech Army said the bomb broke out on the road near the Afghanistan border.
Father's Krautrock returns
The famous German group of seventy years is playing again. Three of the Harmonia groups re-enacted their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a meeting of the most successful band.
They were already much more familiar abroad.
The announced sensation then consists in the performance of three seated gentlemen who at first look like they're just enjoying dinner.
Everyone's got a box, cables, and especially buttons.
Thirty-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt is sitting in the middle.
After his left, he's seven-year-old Michael Rother, who's got a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Thirty-seven-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who concentrates on the synthesizers, is from the perspective of the viewers on the right.
Everyone makes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Some of them, of course, will create a traditional composition.
It doesn't seem to be too much for the musicians.
Among the pets of Krautrock, the revitalist of Harmonia's chapels was a significant stir.
One thing here is worth noting. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of a collective awareness of the pop, but certainly it is not too late to lose this band for some twenty-three years in pain.
But why could not Germany celebrate its still living legends from the 1970s?
And especially when you're a musical style, a well-called Krautrock, in England and America, it's worth more than in your own country.
When in 2003 the music business gave the remaining members of the Cancho group the price of Echo for the life work, the hall was full of questioning views of German pop fans.
In addition, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu at their presentation, the audience no longer knew the boundaries.
Michael Rother later, at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts, he sat with them on the platform as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worshiping abroad is one thing.
By recalling the Harmonia chapel, we overloaded the memory, this trio existed only two years, and even at that time it did not have the effect that others later added.
Moebius and Roedelius were already playing with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promised name of Cluster.
At first, they were playing at the Schaubühne Berlin Theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, at the gramphone company led by the church.
Roder briefly helped the Kraftwerk group, but he won the reputation as a guitarist at the Neu band!, which at that time may have been the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the Cluster chapel into exile in Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, 16th-century ruins, lived as members of the municipalities that fled the city.
They didn't live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius could still walk like a cave.
It was more of a life in such a spitzweg art apartment.
The name of the art in question is allegedly taken from the name of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing congregation, whose badge was allegedly found in the cemetery.
Many of them were preserved by Harmonia.
The first album was called "Hungary of Harmony" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
The gathering of the crops did not serve only self-recognition.
Now the "Live 1974" CD was cut off at a concert in Griss in front of a record-playing little, barely 50-year-old.
Rothera once expressed her desire to be a member of the Harmony and to practice on occasion.
For Roedlia and Moebia, that was a totally inappropriate request.
In 1975 the band announced its breakup.
Rother ended up in an esoteric sphere and assured himself of his future with the white "Fire Heart".
The cluster of Clusters has lived again in the '80s and since then is more successful than Harmony has ever been.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for his live album.
His recording company, Greenland, took the goal of monitoring Krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
Cappella Neu! was considered Rodelil's solo work at the time.
The bodily resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Culture.
The performance at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
He'll be present to Brit, Julian Cope, an old pancake and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
Also participating is the founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
That's what we've been planning for the overall expansion of Krautrock's influence on the future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will just fill out Harmonia.
The Věta Brian Ena, accompanied by the most amazing sounds, is performed in the hall: "The only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are images on which the producer with Harmony is in the agricultural sedation.
The creation of the legend also contributes to the promulgation of other black-white photographs on which are now the devices of wild cables connected.
Before that, three veterans are again employed by improvisation.
I don't have to stick my microphones to the warps and drums anymore, so they can get those unheard of self-made tones out of the tools.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the puncture technique.
It doesn't change anything. It doesn't change the world's culture.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, he whispers under sound clouds and in one beautiful place he emphatically sings "Aaaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was always very English.
It's never been rock.
The roots would be found more than in blues at music schools (Can), in Kraftwerk technologies or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who screams at this place "'68!" is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia won't even let himself out of peace now.
Even the most obvious thing on the scene is to think carefully.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This question can be prepared for the nerves, or it can be done, to experience the thrilling moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough.
The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden have just released two films on the Balkan War.
But not one of them is convinced.
The presentation of the films either puts too much emphasis on accuracy and shooting, or they're too sensitive.
The Hunting Party won't even stop an actor like Richard Gere.
Good news as first: War criminals Karadz and Mladić are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but right there, in the cloudy background of the Bosnian War, with actor Richard Gere October.
In recent times, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the 1980s, not only because he played in many favorite, serious roles in weather women's films, but in connection with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, a person will enjoy another movie with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - where the hunter becomes useful (Why must the names of films be so long and confused today?).
Gere gives a magic performance. His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically who Gere could have happened if fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who has his best years long ago, but as a anxious like a memory still retains a certain remarkable test.
But even through this trump, The Hunting Party is together with a German film Mörderischer Frieden, who is also entering the movie this week, just by continuing an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With the movie Mördescher Frieden, we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who saves the Serbian girl from the Kosovo shooter, and one of them loves her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are not represented here as the cause of all evil, this television film is changing too soon in shooting and action.
There's going to be something much like the Kobru 11 series, without the distance, but for that with the war.
In the film The Hunting Party we can examine in detail why the Balkan War has not been able to film a really good movie so far.
The story of three U.S. war reporters, who are released as "person", a Serbian top war criminal, could become a new "Apocalypse" at another time and under the leadership of another director and screenwriter (here is both Richard Shepard).
Both stories look strange: small groups go into the woods to do something that the army is not able to do, but their journey will become a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the brilliant and sentimental cynic represented at the beginning.
On the contrary, the proposal also presupposes a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party's film can finally be written after the reporters in the last five minutes of the film have done what NATO, the CIA and all the world's criminals have not said in the last five years: catch the criminals and leave him fair revenge of the Bosnian Muslims.
It's so against the logic of filmmaking that it's worth turning to the International Court of The Hague.
Then this film has a deep human message.
It takes the view that Karadz and Mladic are still at liberty, and suspects the Americans and the French (here they are exceptionally united) that under secret political agreements they do not blame themselves for the persecution quite intensively.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, a woman will attack us with the famous Brett poem.
It is a wooden mask of the Asian demon on the desk of the writer: "I look with compassion at the runaway lives on the forehead, noting: how hard it is to be evil."
In movies like The Hunting Party, they come out just as hard as heads, but they indicate how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of war in the Balkans.
Recently, in these newspapers, it was said that all Hollywood films about Iraq were a major failure.
The only thing to add is that there has never been a good film on South Africa.
Almost always applicable: When the star falls through the crisis area or passes through the mine field, it will produce a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the Border of the crash with Angelina Jolie or the Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCapre.
Maybe all those conflicts are just too close to time.
Finally, they had to spend decades before Hollywood could film a good movie about the Holocaust - Schindler's list.
A lot of films must probably come back - movies that are now considered to be classical Vietnamese works - "Love of the deer", "Apokalypsa" or "The Head of the Vest" - were then not celebrated in any case as a masterpiece.
But maybe today, when every mass murder at home appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Then the scriptists do not have the ability that is needed to make sure that good stories are dealt with.
"To be or not to be" or "Great dictator" have become so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin have not yet known how terriblely the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe a man shouldn't want to be good when he wants to make good movies.
Maybe he has to create a sarcasticly balanced artistic view as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was questioned at the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprier's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War", he said, "What kind of thing is just that some things never change.
Cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust's criticism of the rejection of the Olympics
The mayor's resignation from the organisation of the summer Olympics in Hamburg has come to the brink of political and economic criticism.
Many want to continue fighting for the water game.
Von Beust, however, suggests realism in the estimation of chance.
The Chief Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday, marked this decision "for business as unhappy".
No other project has recently woken up in the city as much motivation as an Olympic thought.
"Without this objective, it would not be possible to maintain this sporting political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "which comes from a changed time plan."
The Starosta Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in his earlier statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic by 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told the newspaper WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sports Union will decide on Mnich's application for the Winter Games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance with a time plan dating back to 2028."
Still, this dream hasn't ended, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) marked von Beustov's years as politative.
It's a feeling that Hamburg doesn't want to keep up with the Olympics in the next twenty-five years.
"It's too soon to destroy our chance to see plans at this early stage as buried," said HSB President Günter Ploss on Wednesday.
The reservation would be contrary to the statement of the senate chief, which he referred to at the Vale Assembly of the German High School Sports Association.
Von Beust here won't vote for the 2015 Ambour Award as a reward for organizing the Olympics.
The Hamburg High School Sports Association just last week nominated the candidate city.
The SPD in the Hamburg parliament of the Senate has assumed that it is wasting valuable time, which could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grassbrook area was interrupted by the Senate for years, because he set up the Olympics and excluded the building of apartments," said SPD members Carol Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Klein Grassbrook area was still planning an olympiad with the fact that the entire area would later be used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously established a "Olympian factor".
The opening of the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great excitement in Hamburg.
But Hambork went to Lipsko.
They're not Warhol's boxes.
Those who combine Swedish and wooden expressions don't mean Andy Warhol, but Ike.
Or is it?
Wooden beads made in Sweden currently cast on Warhol's list of dark shadows.
Most of it on the list of the ninety-four "Brillo Boxes" type Stockholm are falsifications.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" several months ago expressed doubts about the validity of Warhol's "Brillo Boxes" from 1968, the internal research of the Museum of Moderna Museet in Stockholm comes with a result that brought disappointment; six "Brillo Boxes", which in 1995 the Museum of Moderna Museet dedicated to the gift of its former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - like most of the other "Brillo Boxes" of the type of Stockholm, which are on the international art market around.
The previous events are wrapped up, maturing a string of artistic and curatorial actions.
Warhol produced his first Brill box in New York in 1964, painted wooden beads that were based on red-modern paper box design of Brillo powder powder.
The exhibition of his work at Moderna Muséet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - was conducted by hundreds of Brillo beynks from the cardboard. They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from Brillo factory.
It's not about art, it's about their suggestions, just the exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to make several wooden Brillo benders in Sweden, but you are not exposed in Moderna Museum.
The German witnesses are now talking about fifteen children who have been legally admitted to art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warholovy Brillo Boxy" with the label Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum later falsely claimed that in 1968 it was made and exposed to about a hundred bees that Warhol left him.
In fact, 105 Hultín’s bees were produced in Malmö for the exhibition in Petrohrad only in 1990.
Warhol was three years after he died.
Lars Byström, the top conservator of Moderna Muséet, examined in addition to the six Brillo boxes that are owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their cross-platform boards were made of basic color and rounded up, were made of oil-white.
From the 1990 copy structure, on the other hand, it appeared that the color was made of painting directly on the circular board without the previous basic shape - in addition to the acrylic and not the oil color.
"These pains were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo Boxes list," said Director Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to any other conclusion, Moderna Museet will have to classify six of his exhibition collections as "exhibit material - copy".
Already in July, the Organisation Authentication Board announced that these "accused charges", which were raised in the case of a copper powder box, will be dealt with.
The organization, however, remains silent until now.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers were released, who settled in a hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The leader of the rebels Antonio Trillanes, who expelled the president of manipulation and corruption during the elections, told the hotel reporters that he refused responsibility for the bloodshed.
The government's surrender soldiers have already attacked the hotel with a flurry of gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers were locked up in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them became court-martial due to an attempt to convert in 2003, including Trillanes.
The conversation was used to get about 30 fellows away.
The military policemen who were supposed to watch him obviously ran over to his side and joined in the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government of the loyal units of the area around the selected hotel closed.
The President permitted an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Triallnes.
"We invite people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, the commander of the former elite units of Scout Rangers, said that in a short time, other military units would join in.
The government's critics called for a large demonstration against the President on Friday.
For months, her government has been charged with corruption.
The Manila financial area has already become the main cause of the rebellion against Arroya in 2003.
Because the rebels refused to join the army, the rebellion broke out in the next 24 hours.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have been made in the Philippines to overthrow the democratically elected government.
