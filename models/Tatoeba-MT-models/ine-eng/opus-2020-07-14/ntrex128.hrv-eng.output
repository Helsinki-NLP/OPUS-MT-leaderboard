The Great Assembly Representatives are concerned that they will "seem as Muppeti"
Some assembly representatives (Assembly Member, AM) proposed that they be called representatives of the Great Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, MWP).
This was due to plans to be renamed the Assembly to the Dutch Parliament.
The representatives of all political spectrums were concerned that they could become the subject of the strike.
A representative of the Labour Party said his group was concerned about the fact that the name "commits with Twp and Pwp".
For reading outside Wales: on the big twp means dumb, and pwp shit.
The representative of the Assembly of the Party of Wales (Volz. Plaid Cymru) said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
The Great Conservative said his group was "open" to change the name, but that MWP could quickly be turned into Muppet.
In this context, the great word "w" is expressed by a similar expression of the word "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing a law for the introduction of a change of name, said: "Of course, the final decision on how the representatives of the assembly will be entitled to be on their own."
The law of the government of Wales in 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the authority to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that were in broad support for the change of the name of the assembly in the Baltic Parliament.
When it comes to what will be called representatives in the assembly, the Committee was inclined to call the "members of the grand parliament" or the MWPs, but the MWP option received the highest support during the public consultation.
The representatives of the Assembly propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could lead to better President Elin Jones, from which it is expected to make a proposal for a law on changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the committees, including rules on the disqualification of representatives of the assemblies and the establishment of a committee system.
During the discussion of the law, the representative of the congregation will have a decisive vote on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to a referendum on the change of country name
Voters will vote on this Sunday if they want to change the name of their country in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a multiannual dispute with neighbouring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents its own Greek territory and repeatedly opposed the launch of its accession process to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not recognise the referendum decision.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that the change of name is a simple price needed to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bell was silenced while the churches in Harlem fought for survival
"The older people I spoke to said that in the past there could be a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"There's nothing today."
He said the disappearance of the bar was understandable.
"People are joining today in a different way," he said.
"Bars no longer represent the living quarters in which people live regularly."
When it comes to churches, then, it is concerned that money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think and "will be found at the beginning sooner or later."
He added that the churches could replace residential buildings with apartments in which people would live who wouldn't help the rest of the churches in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in those buildings will be white people," he said, "that is why you will be faster when those churches are completely closed because it is unlikely that the residents who sit in these buildings will become members of those churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that maintained a nearby temple took over the building.
The church of St. Martin took over the black congregation with the archbishop John Howard Johnson on the front, who also led a boycott of merchants on a little 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the employment or improvement of the blacks.
The 1939 fire seriously damaged the building, but since the parishioners of St. Johnson planned its reconstruction, they ordered a series of bells, called carillon.
St. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and the heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bells of poor people".
The expert who played the carillon in July used a second term: "cultural goods" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, pointed out that it was also the first carillon in the world in which black musician Dionisio A. Lind played for 18 years at the larger carillon in Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What is being played in St. Martin over the past few months is a story of architects and performers of construction works, some of which were brought by laymen to church and other episcopal children.
Sacristija, the managing body of the parish made up of time, wrote to the children in July because of the concern that the child would "continuate to transfer the costs" to the Sacristi, although the church was not involved in the involvement of architects and construction workers who sent the child.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the child.
Sea dog injured 13-year-olds during the dive of lobsters in California
According to official report, a sea dog attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he ran after a lobster in California on the day of opening the hunting season on the lobsters.
The attack took place some time before 7 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said at the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he ran with friends about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then with the group he drove to the attack site to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he at first thought it was an excitement because of a caught lobster, but then he realized that he was shouting, "He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire key bone was broken.
"I agreed to everyone get out of the water: 'In the water is a sea dog!'," Hammel added.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to a children's hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of a sea dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
The captain of the rescue team Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in that area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species of a shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma damage to the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swamia in Ecinitas for investigation and security of buyers.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in that area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans for entry into the UK’s beauty market
Sainsbury’s is becoming a competition for chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic plates in the style of working houses and by engaging specialized sellers.
As a result of the large entry into the UK's beauty market of GBP 2.8 billion, which continues to grow compared to the drop in sales on the home market, larger cosmetic plates will be tested in 11 stores across the country and extended to additional trades next year if shown to successful ones.
Investment in cosmetic products is one of the ways in which supermarkets try to use space on police that was once intended for televisions, microwaves and household equipment.
Sainsbury’s representatives said they would double the offer of cosmetic products to 3,000 products, including the first time and trade marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And there's an assortment of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space with areas for certain trade brands like Boots.
The supermarket will relaunch its assortment of decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and that is what younger buyers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, a perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will try to use concessions in two Sainsbury’s shops, the first one that was opened last week in Croydon in southern London and the second one that opens at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Net purchases and return to daily purchases of small quantities of food in local food stores means that supermarkets need to make more efforts to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Director-General of Sainsbury, said that she would look more and more like a business house while that supermarket chain is trying to resist the favourable trades such as Aldi and Lidl offer a larger number of services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced outlet Argos in hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats departments because he bought both chains two years ago, with which he strongly encouraged the sale of nutrients and made these acquisitions more profitable.
The previous Supermarket attempt to refresh its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments was not successful.
Sainsbury’s entered a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but it ended up fighting about the share of the revenues of the drug in its supermarkets.
The new strategy followed after Sainsbury’s three years ago, GBP 125 million sold its pharmaceutical business in the 281 Celesiu store, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
He claims that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by assigning an assortment of luxury products for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's said: "We have changed the appearance and perception of our departments with cosmetic products to give our users a more comfortable environment.
We also put in special training a colleague who will be at the hands of the buyers and give them advice.
Our assortment of trademarks is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and the available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to changes in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "excited" after Holly Willoughby gave up a contract worth 11 million pounds.
The Dragon’s Day Peter Jones show star left to "fight the anger" after the TV leader Holly Willoughby gave up a contract worth 11 million pounds with his trade mark to focus on his new contracts with the trade chain Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of household clothes and fashion supplements Truly.
Their trade mark is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow trade mark.
The director of this Morning (37) show on Instagram announced he's leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragon’s Dan Peter Jones show star to cook out of anger by pulling herself out of a joint profitable job to focus on her own new great contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources claim that Jones was "angrily" when a golden girl television during a busy meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contracts were worth up to 1.5 million pounds means that there is no longer enough time to devote themselves to their trade brand home clothing and fashion supplements Truly.
This job was compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's trade mark and was supposed to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of the greatest Holly priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would ensure for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw caught everything involved in that job.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to moving the whole line.
In Marlow's headquarters, there's a lot of stuff that's ready for sale."
Experts believe that due to the departure of this Morning, one of the stars in Britain in which it is most profitable to invest, the company could suffer millions of losses due to the large funds invested in the products in the range of pillows and candles to clothing and household clothes and the possible additional delay of the line.
And that could mean the end of a long - term friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were ten years close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truely with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as president of the administration in March.
Couples spend vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an M&S trade mark ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of ITV's I'm a celebrity.
The source of closeness to Jones last night said, "We don't want to comment on his business activities."
Hard negotiations, and then we fell in love
He complained about the criticism he would get in the newspapers because of comments that some might consider as "insufficient president" and because he has such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give so many concessions?"
Tromp said, reflecting the voice of the news manager.
"I didn't give any concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have been suspended.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea's main diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not notice the "responsive" US response to the nuclear disarmament activities of North Korea.
He noted that instead, the United States has not yet abolished sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic attitude in his speech at the assembly.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were threatened by a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be lost.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – the cessation of missile testing, the relief of hostages and the return of the remaining American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to act as president, but instead of waiting for 10,000 people in front of this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to a bunch of people directly in front of him.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, NGOs were said to be unnecessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not seeking international help, so it's all a little problematic," Mrs. Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children organization is a team that will travel to Pala, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disasters Office, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to participate in aid efforts.
In view of the continued ground support in Indonesia, this country is still sadly not prepared to bear the wrath of nature.
Although shelters in the case of tsunamis are built in Aceha, it is not something that is customary on other parts of the coastline.
The absence of sirens for warnings on the tsunamis in Palu, although the warning was in force, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And in the best time, traveling between numerous Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital's ship that was anchored in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Pala, but it needs at least three days to get to the scene of a new disaster.
The improvement of the Indonesian decayed structure was the basis for the election campaign of President Joko Widodo and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the government under Yoko is struggling with a lack of financial resources, and the next year new elections are held.
Yoko is also faced with the pressure of remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were disbanded from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting on the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Player Liverpool Daniel Sturridge hit the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday from defeating the Premier League against Chelsea in 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres from Chelsea naked at the result of 1:0 for Chelsea.
He put the ball on his left leg before he shot her to the opposite stop.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the top right corner of the network.
In the end, the ball ran away from Kepay Arrizabalaga, which jumped towards her and entered the network.
"It was necessary to get to that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as close as possible, so I tried to give as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com
"I've seen Kante come and I've just touched the ball. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea led in half-time with a 1:0 after meeting the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The blue attacker passed the ball back to Mateu Kovacic during that game before he turned somewhere in half the field and ran into Liverpool's half.
He did a quick addition to the middle of the field.
Then he directed a beautiful pass ball that had led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard went around the defense and hit the ball with his left leg in the net on the opposite pole next to the goalman Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool is playing a ball game against Naples in the League of champions at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea is waiting for videoton in the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths in Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The number of deaths in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, reported the state disaster office on Sunday morning.
The agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference that a large number of people were reported to have been trapped in the building's ruins after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that was felt on Friday and caused waves of heights up to 6 metres.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is full of the remains of destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a man (32) for suspicion of murder after a woman was killed.
The murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead this morning in Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 07:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews in John Street, and the 32-year-old was arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police called on people from that area to report if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hogan said: "The investigation is still at the beginning, but I would like to see all those who were near John's street in Birkenhead, and they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to invite all, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was the resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon at the scene came friends who thought they knew that woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation was under way, and the police said it was in the process of informing the nearest victim's family.
The cab driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him that no one can enter the building or get out of it.
He left without a word when he found out what happened.
The tenants are now told that it will take a few hours until they can return to their apartments.
The cop reportedly told someone that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up at a crime scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "That's so terrible."
At 14:00 in the fenced area, there were two police vans, and another one was parked directly outside.
A large number of policemen were standing inside the fenced area and were monitoring the housing block.
All who have any information are requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, called 101 or to be sent anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, calling for a record 247 of 30 September.
Kip Cromwell in Parliament is the newest monument to be held in the middle of a debate on "the end of history"
His persecution would be poetic justice for almost the Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts that his fanatic Puritan followers did.
But Cromwell's society has called Mr. Crick's attempt to "fool" and "try to break history".
John Goldsmit, president of Cromwell’s society, said: “In the debate that is currently being conducted on the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace became the subject of debate.
The iconoclassism of the English Civil Wars is not something Cromwell ordered or did.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the proceedings of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The wonderful revitalization of Cromwell Sir William Hamoa Thorneycroft is evidence of the way of thinking of the 19th century and a part of the history of a person for whom many still consider it to be worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today, a defender of the parliament from external pressure. Of course, in his case it was the pressure of the monarchy.
Is that a completely credible opinion the subject is a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the post-development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique recognizable figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements in the role of the Lord of Protectors are still valuable gifts of honour and marking."
A pig killed by a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, pigs attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
The man mentioned only the name "Yuan" was found dead cut off and blood covered near the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province was published in the South China Morning Letter on Sunday.
The pig breeder prepared to immunize pigs in May 30th 2005 in Xingu in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the stand with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that the pig weighed 250 pounds [250 kg] of the breeder to death.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and suffocated."
The security footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 p.m. to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The manager of the market said for the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on someone else while the police are collecting evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market manager are allegedly negotiating a fee for his death.
Although this rarely occurs, the attacks of pigs on humans have already been recorded.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her wife on their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 200 pounds [300 kg] of preyed a large farmer with a tractor until his wife took the animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "offer".
"They're just played.
They're grinning, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's hurricane brings strong rains to the south-west of the United States
As announced, Hurricane Rosa is weak as it passes over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But during the next days, Rosa will bring flood rains in northern Mexico and southwestern United States.
In 05:00 in the east time, Rosa blew at 140 km/h, making it hurricane category 1, and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific it creates a low-pressure area and moves towards the Western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of tropical storms, it will begin to push a deep layer of tropical moisture towards the north towards the Southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture in interaction with the approaching low pressure area will cause the emergence of strong areas in much of the south-west.
In the local areas 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous storms, mud storms and possible cliffs in the desert.
The deep layer of tropical moisture will cause the formation of a range of approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
It is possible to flood storms with a rapid deterioration of the conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rain.
There's no way to recommend going to the desert of the pedestrians because of the threat of tropical storms.
Strong rain could turn cannons into wild rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local storm winds and dusty gusts.
Approaching low-pressure areas will bring local strong rains on parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible to cause a volume greater than 12 mm, which may cause less mud holes and rocky roads.
It's going to be the first wave in the wet season in this region.
The scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the late evening and Monday morning before the end of the day on Monday and on Tuesday cover the wider area.
The strong rain will spread on Tuesday in the area where the borders of the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah are touched all day long.
In October, large temperature changes across the United States are possible to cool the Arctic, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature in small distances.
Sunday is a great example of the dramatic temperature differences in the Central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omahe in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days the remaining summer heat will continue to grow and expand again.
It is expected that in most of the Central and Eastern United States, the beginning of October will be warm from 27 degrees from the South-East to the North-East.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a great possibility of excessive temperatures in the East of the United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks protesting hard on candidates for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political accounts continued, and the reporters interrupted the regular programme to inform the changeover at the last moment of Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had touched her drunk condition and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a heated witness that he was absolutely sure it didn't happen.
The Friday hearing was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number mentioned in Nielsen's report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
No viewers were immediately available for other networks that had been listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of people who look at the content in the offices.
In order to get to know you better, it's about a audience that's a number similar to the one who's looking at playing American football or the Oscar division.
Fox News Channel, whose guests in the study strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the largest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the entire day's hearing, reported from Nielsen.
ABC took another place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the office of that moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, they recorded on him shouting demonstrators while trying to go to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
A couple of minutes stood in the eye while the CNN demonstrators shot him alive in front of the CNN cameras.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he speaks the truth of this country?"
They said to him, "You have power when such women are helpless."
Flake said that his office had issued a notice before the elevator door closed, that he would say more at the committee hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks followed live when the Justice Committee had to vote on the direction of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote throughout the Senate.
But Flake said he would do it only on condition that the FBI investigates charges against candidates during the next week, which required democracy in the minority.
Flakea partially convinced talks with a friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After the conversation with Coons, and then a few other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI's investigation of the Kavanauga charges.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of his plan to leave the European Union to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham in the United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former Foreign Minister, continued to criticise her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit in the second interview with her on the same issue, saying that it was a proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should charge each other with "full stupidity" customs duties.
The murder of Waydea Sims: police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspect of the LSU player's death
The police arrested a murder suspect with the firearms of Waydea Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and detained under arrest for murder in custody, Baton Rouge's police department reported.
Officials posted a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found glasses at the crime scene and reported finding Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB, CBS branch reported.
After the Simpson police investigation, he admitted he shot Waydea and killed him.
A 350,000-dollar U.S. bailout was requested.
The office of the mayor of eastern Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a spreading head wound through the neck.
The police administration thanks the work group for the fugitives of the Louisiana Federal Police, the criminal police lab of the state, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva thanked local authorities for implementing the law on "tolerance and searching for the truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
An 183 cm high wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"That's what we're always worried about," Wade said.
Vulcan throws ash into Mexico City
The ashes that expels the Volcano Popocatapetl reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The national disaster prevention centre on Saturday warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 emissions and ashes over 24 hours.
The center was followed by multiple squeezing and squeezing.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ashes on windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have observed an increase in volcanic activity, which is located 72 kilometres south-east of the capital since the 2017 earthquake of magnitude 7.1 shook central Mexico.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists meet the annual independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors defending independence clashed with the intervention police and after thousands of people joined protest demonstrations to mark a Catalan polarizing vote on eviction.
A group of masked separatists who had been acquitted by the intervention police began to throw out policemen with eggs and paint in dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded by tourists.
The fights were even later during the days when the police used sticks to calm the fight.
For a few hours, groups that advocate independence were scanning "No forgetfulness, No Forgiveness", and against them the unionists called "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital for minor injuries during the demonstration, the local press reported.
The tensions in the region that is strained by independence did not come about a year after the November 1st referendum, which Madrid declared to be a pro-law, and which the Catalan separatists celebrate.
The vast majority of voters decided on independence although the exit was small because those who opposed the vaccination were mostly boycotting the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in severe conflicts last year after the police tried to stop voting in polls across the region.
Groups who are committed to independence spent Friday night on the street in order to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but the demonstrators were forced to move the other way.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who attended separatist demonstrations along with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would gain independence.
"We experienced one of the best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness that they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a key, although a strong victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalonian independence parties are hard to maintain this year because their most well-known leaders are in the self-appointed exile or in detention awaiting trial because of their role in organizing referendums and subsequent declarations of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict had prompted politicians on both sides.
"The situation is all tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders, who had been in prison for the last year, announced that he would run for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Application for European elections is the best way we can recognise the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men after car crashing into the house
Three men from 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after several car hits into the house in Londonderry.
The incident took place Thursday at around 19.30 BST in Ballyngard Crescent.
Detective insp. Bob Blemmings said the yard doors and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point in the car, a single-shot shot was fired.
Hit Menge brought Livingstone's victory over the Rangers with the result 1:1
The first goal of Dolly Menge for Livingstone brought victory
The new Scottish Primership club, Livingston, surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his only second defeat from the eighteenth game at the head of the club from the Ibrox stadium.
The Dolly Menge shot turned out to be a decisive one while Gary Holt's team in a second dealt with the Iberian.
Gerrard's team is still without a win in the Premiership of this season, and next Saturday they're playing against Hearts, the leading club in the league behind which are eight points.
Prior to that, Rangers in the European League will host the Rapid Vienna Club on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone has increased its number of wins on six games, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet experienced defeat since Kenny Miller's shift last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead before they got this shot, given that their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but there was an argument on the way to the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only point the ball wide after he cleaned up to cut Craig Halket's head off to the goal.
Hosts are happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause difficulties for guests
And that's exactly how the key goal was achieved.
The Rangers missed to stop the free strike, and Livingston invented the opening, whereby Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisted Mengi together, who hit in the middle of the goal.
Until then, Rangers had most control of the ball, but they faced an unprovoked domestic defense, so Golman Liam Kelly had no business at all.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the strike.
The legs of the Golman Rangers Allan McGregor have apologized to Scott Pittman, and Lithgow directed a broad strike from another organised attack in Livingstone.
Long add-on failed to cross the Livingstone naked line, and there were not two one-stars – after Halket's conflict with the replacement player Glen Middleton and one to play hand.
"Great" by Livingstone – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from Scottish BBC in Arena Tony Macaroni
Excellent game and the result of Livingstone.
All up to one was excellent, which they continued to surpass expectations on that entry path.
Their style of games and staff hardly changed since their return to big clubs, but a great favor goes to Holt and the way he united the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at the head of an excellently organized defense, and Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to have an exaggeration during the whole game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards that set a good game under Gerard.
They failed to reach the ball until the end, just once they opened a hole in the home team, and that's their own call to market for Rangers in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan waiting for mixed feelings in Koelna
On Saturday (September 29th) everything was a lot of smiles under the sky when the leaders of the Turkish and Germans met after breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan Germany, whose objective is to repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They fell apart in opinions on issues involving human rights, freedom of the press and accession of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Koeln to open a huge new mosque.
In that city, the largest Turkish population lives outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police blocked a mass gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but a large number of presidents who came to see it appeared nearby.
And hundreds of protestors against Erdogan – a large number of Kurdas – raised their voice by condemning Erdogan's politics and the German government's decisions to welcome him to the country.
Conflict demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor some German Turks celebrate as heroes, and others attack as autocrats.
Road crash in Deptford: a biker died in a car crash
The biker died in a car crash in London.
Sudar happened near the intersection of the streets of Beswod and Evelyn, on the road with dense traffic in Deptford in the southeastern town of about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and there was an emergency, but the man died on the spot.
The crash took place a few months after the death of another biker after a crash and a runaway driver from the Childrens Street accident, about a mile and a half of the Saturday crash site.
City police have reported that police officers are trying to identify a man and inform his closest relative.
Because of the accident, the roads are closed and bus traffic is redirected, and motor vehicle drivers are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: six police officers injured in riots
The prison authorities reported that six police officers were injured in a man's prison in prison of a man's undercover type.
The riots broke out in Long Martin's prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and still persist.
The special "Tornado" units were brought to reduce the disturbances that include eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers on the face are provided with help because of minor facial injuries.
The spokesman for the prison department said: “The prison personnel were specially trained to resolve the incident during Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members received help because of the damage.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we want to make it clear that everyone in charge will be handed over to the police and that they can spend a long time behind the rescue."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the intervention police were called to prison to resolve a serious situation in which staff were attacked by beer balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with bivalve molluscs (possible utility for dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression hit Arizona, but there is a likelihood that it will happen just at the beginning of the next week when the hurricane of Rosa, with the remaining power, passes over the Desert-West and brings danger to the stormy floods.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued warnings on the bivalve molluscs for Monday and Tuesday in the West Arizona area, across southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should get close to Phoenix late on Monday with the rain and cross it straight through Tuesday.
In his tweet, the National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix reported that “only ten tropical cyclones since 1950 brought a tropical storm or depression about 320 miles [320 km] from Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Centre provides 50 to 100 mm of barrels, with isolated quantities up to 150 mm on the Mogollon coast of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert West, including the Stinjak and the Great Basin, there is a probability of a range of 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated total quantities up to 100 mm.
For them beyond the danger of the devastating floods of Rosa could come as a rescue because the region was hit by drought.
Although the floods are a major threat, part of these areas could be useful because in the south-west the government is currently dry.
"According to the American map of dry areas a little more than 40 percent of Arizona was hit by at least extreme drought, another highest category," weather.com said
The journey of the hurricane first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the power of hurricanes with a maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and was moving north at 20 km per hour.
The storm hit the colder waters of the Pacific, so it weakened you.
Therefore, it is expected that Monday afternoon or evening the coast of Mexico will be approached by a tropical storm.
The rain in the parts of Mexico could be strong and represent a significant danger from the emergence of the flood.
"The amount of total volumes expected in the area from the Baja California peninsula to the north-west Sonore is 75 to 150 mm, possible maximum 250 mm," weather.com said.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and south Utah by Tuesday late at night.
"The main danger expected of Rose or its remains is very strong rains on the peninsula of Baja California, on the north-east of Sonora and in the American Desert West," they reported from the National Hurricane Centre.
You are expected to be caused by the rains of the life of dangerous storms and storms of mud in the deserts and cliffs in the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-olds were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
About 04.00 BST on Saturday in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton was found a wounded teenager.
He's taken to the hospital and he's stable.
The police administration of Avona and Somerseta reported that 17-year-olds, 2 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
Police officers have called for all those who have a video of events to appear.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh suffered the evil and anger of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugha is a vote to reject the brutal and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a pre-election assembly in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanauh testified on Thursday before Congress and strongly and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's charges for sexual assault decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified to hearing the charges she filed.
The president said on Saturday that day "the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugha.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugha is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an uncompromising career in public service," he said to the assembled accessions in West Virginia.
The president touched on the Kavanaugh nominations as he spoke about the importance of the Republican's election in half the presidential term.
"For five weeks we are divided into one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but actually I am," he said.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump stated that a democratic mission was to "make resistance and obstructions".
The Republican Leader's Assistant said to the CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Cavanaugh Nomination Senate is expected by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis, and the number continues to rise
The authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people died, a large number of them pulled off the huge waves that struck the coast when the great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Pala on Friday, when up to six meters high in the summer wave hit the coast, pulling many of them to death and ruining everything on their way.
Cunami suffered after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When there was a danger of tsunami yesterday, people were still on the beach and they didn't run away immediately," Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Indonesian agency to mitigate the consequences of the BNPB disaster at the Jakarta press conference.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he was pulling cars, fats, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
"Some people went to the trees to escape the tsunami and survive," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated at 24 centers in Palu.
Photographs from the air published by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, damaged and destroyed bridges and the mosque surrounded by water.
The subsequent strikes continued to punish that coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
In its statement, the Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) announced that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was equivalent to the two-fold force of atomic bombs fired at Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical location of the city at the end of the long and narrow Gulf may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the building and added that 540 people were injured, and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh's words, the number of victims and damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Dongal and near the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications are completely interrupted and we don't have information from Dongal."
"More than 300,000 people live in this area," says Red Cross report, which adds that staff and volunteers have been directed to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could be much worse," the statement states.
On Saturday, the agency got a lot of criticism because of the failure to provide information that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials claim the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social networks, it can be heard that a man on the top floor of the building panics to warn people down on the street about the coming tsunami.
Within a few minutes the watering wall collapsed on the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency could not verify the authenticity of the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a lack of electricity that caused a break in communication about Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue action.
According to the authorities, it began to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but food and other necessary supplies were still needed to be evacuated.
The city airport is reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia took more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although World Vision staff from Dongal have successfully arrived in the city of Pala, where employees have been removed from inter-aulin tents set up in the yard of their office, they have passed the scenes of destruction on the way," said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched a disaster relief chariot, some have complained that the arrival of foreign humanitarians with great expertise is impossible in Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, the financing, supply and engagement of staff from other countries can only begin if the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says "All right, it's a national disaster" we can receive international aid, but such a situation has not yet been declared."
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami fell on Paul on Friday, friends and families of those who were still considered missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that alleviate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
The boy was rescued from the sewer on Saturday.
On Saturday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped for two days under the ruins of her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian state paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for Asian games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those prisoners at Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagija, were his students.
"In view of the many years spent in paragliding, I bear my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel, which extended to the paragliding community, whatsApp sent messages to the competitors from Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
But his messages are still marked with a gray square, instead of two blue squares.
"I think that means that messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while filling ATMs in the center of Newport on the Levee
The thieves stole 26.750 U.S. dollars on Friday morning from Brink's employee who filled a ATM in downtown Newport on the Levee, is in charge of the Newport police office's press.
In the statement of Detective Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the car emptied the ATM in the fun complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy with this, the other man "came in the race to the Brin's employee behind the back" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in the ATM.
The Witnesses noticed more suspicious people fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of people involved in the incident.
Everyone who has any information about their identity should contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rename rapper in Ye
Raper Kanye West will change the name in Ye.
On Saturday's Twitter release, which announced this change, he wrote: "Life will be officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used it as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change comes in front of his guests at the Saturday Night Live show, which is expected to launch its new Yandhi album.
The authors of the show said that the show replaced the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled for "emotional reasons".
In addition to the shortness of his current artistic name, West said earlier that this word had religious significance for him.
"I think that "yes" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier this year in a conversation about the title of his album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's me, it's us.
It's from Kanye, which means "one" in Y-only – that's a good, bad, confused, all in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are."
He's one in a series of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And the former West co-worker, JAY-Z, was playing with versions of his name without a letter and with a letter written in great words.
Mexican AMLO promised he wouldn't use the army against the citizens
A candidate for Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised he would never use military force against citizens while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of the revenge on students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelolco's market promised he would "never use the army against the Mexican people."
Military forces fired during peaceful demonstrations in that market on 2 October 1968 and killed even 300 people at the time of the start of the movement of left-wing students in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador was committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly support to those studying and opening up a larger number of free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education attract young criminal gangs.
US should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"Since China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount that it invests in research in that area," the investor in artificial intelligence and expert in that area Kai Fu Leee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
This comment followed after various parts of the US government announced plans on artificial intelligence, although the US is basically lacking a formal strategy on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the first country in the number AI of innovation by 2030.
"A double increase in the research budget in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States and that we are looking for the next great discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"Two-fold increase in investment could double the chances that up to the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will come to the United States," Lee said this week in a conversation with the CNBC.
Lee, whose book: "Al Magnesium: China, Silicon Valley and a new world order", published this month by the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, one of the most successful AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 80s last century at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on the AI system that won the best U.S. game player Othello, and later he was director of the Microsoft Research Department and president of the Google China border.
Lee praised the previous American government's technological contests, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, the Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when to be held next to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to obtain state grants.
"It's not China that leads academic leaders, it's corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have engaged the brightest minds from universities to work on researching artificial intelligence over the past few years.
Lee said that the changes in immigration policy could also help the United States boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that doctors in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically offer green cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council published the Plan for the Development of the Art Intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation provides financial resources to persons in academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other state organisations provide financial resources to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from the activities and academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced investment in $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, it currently invests more than 100 million US dollars a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, American legislation that wanted to set up the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence does not do anything for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on changing the name of their country
Macedonian citizens voted on Saturday at the referendum on whether they want to change their country's name in "the Republic of Northern Macedonia". This is a move that could resolve the dispute with Greece that has been going on for decades and which has blocked Greece's opening negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece claims that its northern neighbour's name represents its own occupation and has put the veto on entry to NATO and the EU.
Two governments in June agreed on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum, and the campaign for boycotting the vote cast doubt as to whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?"
Applicants for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that it is a price worth paying to Macedonia, one of the countries that occurred after the collapse of Yugoslavia, has allowed for access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia so that they could live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the outcome of the vote is not legally binding, Members of Parliament have said enough that they will respect it to be considered decisive.
The change of names requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral authority said that no irregularities were reported within 13 hours.
However, output was only 16%, compared with 34% during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjos Tanevski, a speaker from Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško, joined the country's name change referendum in Strumica on 30 September 2018, which would open the way to joining NATO and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov in front of parliament in Skopje set a small stage and framed chairs in front of tents set by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised heads, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring so much needed investment to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the "positive" result would represent "the confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43% of voters will attend the referendum, which is below the necessary response.
The second survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV showed that 57% of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they'd support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the output must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government since it took over the mandate in May last year.
See: Player Manchester City Sergio Aguero goes through the entire Brighton defense to achieve a hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, were defeated by Brighton's defense and brought victory to Manchester City with a result of 2 : 0.
Aguero made the victory crazy simple, reaching a hit in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received an addition in the middle of the field at the beginning of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton's defense players and then got to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four opponents in green shirts.
He went through one of the defenders, and then he beat them a few more on the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball left to Sterling.
The first attempt was made by an English attacker to bring back the ball to Aguere, who threw the right-hand side of the ball into the net and defeated Brighton's doorman Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some trouble with his feet," reporters reported, Manager Manchester City, Pep Guardiola.
"We planned to play which 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he got shot at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage of the Prime Minister's league.
That hit was achieved in 29 minutes.
Aguero got deep into Brighton's field during that ball game.
Beautifully added the ball to Leroy Saneu along the left-hand side.
Sane pushed the ball a few times before steering Sterling to the station.
A Sky Blues attacker put the ball in the net before he slipped into the car.
Manchester City fights Hoffenheim in the team game League champions on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to disable Rockies' progress
Since national players were eliminated from playing, there was no reason to insist on a new start.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes to win Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West, get into play.
Rockies won at least on Friday night from 5 : 2 above Nationals provided a place in wild-card play, but they still hope to win their first title.
"Although we're playing for nothing, we can at least throw out the atmosphere here in Denver with a bunch of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I'd be witnessing this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nationals still have to publish a Sunday beginner, but they're probably willing to offer Scherzer to play in that case.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, got warmed up in the space of the shooters on Thursday and played on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The Washington right-hand side of this season has achieved a score of 18 : 7, the average of winning races (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds of the changes.
Tromp in a collection in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of the outcome of the Republican voters' general election, the President commented on his election as Judge of the Supreme Court.
"All we've done will be on the test in the cold.
It's still five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big – I didn't run, but I'm actually running, and that's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: “You see this terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
Their intention is to take power again in any way; you see wickedness, corruption.
They do not care about who needs to be hurt, who must be overpowered to take over power and control; therefore they want power and control; and we will not give them any more."
As the Democrats say, they have a mission "to resist and disturb".
"You've seen it over the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "serious, evil, corrupt and false."
He addressed the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein of the Senate Justice Committee as a name, which caused the public's verbal abuse.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leave the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document – it was really a bad body speech, the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer imports different opinions.
Does not tolerate the issue of personal preferences
It didn't surprise me when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I'm the last in a series of Labour Party representatives who were told not to welcome – and all because we said what was in our minds.
According to my colleague Joan Ryan, they took a similar stand because they strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar themes that Jeremy Corbyn did not agree with the previous leadership.
In a briefing on the meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party's border, it was stated on Friday that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years I worked as a local representative of the Labour Party's meeting of the General Council on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings take place in a different tone, and the promise of a "loving, gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, since the collaborators I considered to share similar political views from me began to demand a drastic change of opinion and acceptance of positions I would never otherwise agree with – whether it was about national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – follow the rumors of abusive speech on social networks calling for my objection, which are rejected by the Center’s politics and advise me not to be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I've had more luck than some of my colleagues because I've had comments that are mainly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a variety of sexist or racist comments every day, but they never stop.
One of the aspects of this political era that disappointed me most is the tolerance of offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer take different opinions into account and that with any proposal for non-confidentialness or change of the rules of the election, we become a more and more ingrained party.
They've advised me many times in the last two years that I'm not so loud and they've told me everything's gonna be okay."
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since 32 years ago, as a student, I joined the Labour Party, encouraged by neglecting the Margaret Thatcher government, which has left my school multi-purpose student, I wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most – either as a local councillor or a minister in the government.
I've never been hiding my policy, and I've never been in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham border in the east could have been misled about my political positions and areas of conflict with current leadership.
All I would order for those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country grabs against Brexit that will negatively reflect on households, companies and public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But actually, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my election units, whether it's about the Labour Party members or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of opposition or political benefit will distract me from acting as I consider to be in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 undamaged Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have had some impact on the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the day in Tennent's Premiership League.
Now they've reached the top of the ladder and they're the only one undamaged by ten teams.
Finally, the top defense and better use of the opportunity led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"They have tried us at every game so far, and we are still unharmed, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose Club said, "Every honour to Ayr, they took advantage of opportunities better than us."
The try of Grant Anderson in 14 minutes that made Frazier Climo led Ayr, but the yellow card for Scottish players Rory Hughes, who were excluded from the game, enabled Melrose to raise the result, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Ayra's leadership to one-aester before, at the same half-time, he got hit and made a self-test to change the result for Ayr at 17:5 in front of the stand.
But Melrose started the second half well and tried Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious accident of Ruaridid Knott that they carried on the carrier, and when the game went on, Ayr continued a good game by trying Stafford McDowall that made Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then got the yellow card and Melrose again made an additional player pay, and this unrealised attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The sidewalker, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card for crashing the Clim who didn't have a ball; with the line for a penalty strike, MacPherson made a landing behind Ayra in a full swing of the passage.
Climo realized how he did it almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe received a high shot from David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's side player in the fifth attempt of domestic boys.
The Still Game series star seems ready for a new career in restaurant activity
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game series, appears to be ready to continue working in service after it has been found to be appointed director of licensed restaurants.
56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in a favorite BBC series, whose screenwriter and one of the stars, along with a long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
Two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last to show, and Kiernan seems to plan to dedicate his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Agrindingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one source for the Scottish Sun insisted that Kiernan want to be included in "the rest of the restaurant activity in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, who has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will grant her exit to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the marine center with a full elevator in La Paz.
The public buildings reported a flag of ocean color.
Sea bass from Lake Titicaca to Amazon or crilet: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to bring him back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, the memory of the lost seashore in favour of Chile during the 19th century's conflict with the resources is still alive – just as the demand for the resuscitation of the Pacific.
While Bolivia is awaiting the judgement of the International Court of Justice expected on 1 October, after a five-year procedure, and hopes may be at the highest level in the last few decades.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, optimistically awaits the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
The people of Bolivia will see the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia's position that Chile, after more than a decade of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate on the accession of the sovereign exit to the Bolivian sea.
Here's Morales, a Bolivian charismatic president who faces a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, can also benefit from the verdict on Monday.
"We are the result of the return of the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will judge for Bolivia and that it would change a little if it did.
A UN body with a seat in the Netherlands has no authority to assign Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the judgement of the International Court of Justice is coming all six months after the final hearing, means that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interest, the last four years may have been delayed.
"The question of access to the sea has now adopted Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' wartime rhetoric buried every good will of Chile, he thinks.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at once, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
Those two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court made a decision unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an unprecedented opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "stop 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used a maritime question as a political stick.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea said it wouldn't come to nuclear disarmament if it couldn't trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never disarm nuclear unless he could trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations Governing Body on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises of the day during the meeting of the leaders of these two opposing countries in Singapore.
The comments were addressed at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the sanctions have continued because of the "miss of imagination" and that the US's opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will not at all throw the North on its knees.
Washington is not willing to support the declaration without Pjongang taking concrete disarmament steps first.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism about the serious intention of Pyongyang to reject arsenals that this country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongang next month to prepare for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
Paris' fashion magazines reveal that the last line of big covers the head on the road to luxury trade in your neighborhood
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or completely cover the sun, do not look further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne in fashion presented a line of naked crowds covering their head for their spring and summer 2019 collection and were delighted by their style lovers in Paris's week of fashion.
Extremely impractical hats this summer passed Instagram, and these designers sent their creations that drew attention to the track.
The example that came to mind was Valentino, and it was about a big fly hat decorated with a wide range of feathers that completely "takes" the head of the model.
The other glamorous supplements included jewelry-coated cups, magic hats, and even pineapples, but these supplements are not meant to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – still on time for Halloween.
Many hairy masks had shiny lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than those of high fashion.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a trigger and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
Are you following the great fashion statement – happiness is on your side.
Stylists predict huge hats could come to luxury shops in your neighborhood.
The huge hats perfectly fit the "La Bomba", the broken hat with a wide range of about 60 cm, which is seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanne to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural trade mark behind the extremely unpracticed hat that had submitted social networks on the fashion track sent another great creation – a broken beach bag nearly as large as a maneken in the bathing suit she wore.
In the summer collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera for 2019, the exhibition was a sample of the summer collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera in Paris's weekly fashion.
Stylist of famous and famous, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury shops next year. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for big fashion supplements."
John Edward: Language skills the citizens of the world need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding results exams, and added weight to this give individual and common success in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are trying to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want and make them to the citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement that school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desired subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, it goes in his head.
If you speak his mother tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relations with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year’s final exams show that the most evaluations in languages have been carried out by graduates of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have been taught by language have received excellent grades.
The data collected in 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received an excellent mandarin language assessment, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students also received the highest possible assessment.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Today, languages as electoral objects are considered equally important as STEM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the United Kingdom on employment and skills in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers cannot fill jobs due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative for the preparation of young people for careers.
Since more and more jobs are being sought for language knowledge, these skills are key in a globalised world.
Regardless of the choice of careers, those who have learned to speak foreign languages in the future will feel the benefits of such long - term skills.
A person who speaks more languages can communicate directly with the parties, which gives her an advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YouGov in 2013 involving more than 4000 adults, 75% of subjects in the United Kingdom do not know the language well enough to communicate on it, and French is the only language that speaks the two-digit percentage of subjects, more precisely 15% of them.
So investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
In Scotland every school offers different languages.
Some schools in their programme will classify classical, modern languages, while others will decide on languages that are considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom 2020, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, in independent schools you will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff that is professional in this area.
Scottish independent schools provide an environment in which learning will be prepared and armed with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what our future may be.
It cannot be ignored that today's global business of language knowledge is very important for the future of each country, so that it must also be reflected in education.
Thus, the knowledge of modern languages should really be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer the choice of languages, diversity and excellence for young Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will play Lakers' dress for the first time on Sunday in San Diego
The fans will soon be waiting for LeBron James' first performance for Lakers from Los Angeles.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play in the first preseason match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes she's gonna play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton told Lakers' official website.
The rapporteur of Lakers Mike Trudell announced a tweet that James would probably not play the whole game.
After training at the beginning of this week, James answered questions about his pre-season plans in the Lakers, consisting of six games.
"In this phase of my career, I really don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump holds a collection in West Virginia, a channel on YouTube
President Donald Trump launches a campaign with numerous gatherings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five planned collections that Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet given his voice to the new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming elections because there is a danger that Republicans will lose most in Congress after the November vote.
In what hours does the evening Trump's gathering in West Virginia begin, and how can you view it on the network?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 19 hours in the east time, tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trump's collection in West Virginia can be viewed online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably comment on this week's hearings of candidates for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh who have raised controversy over the charge of sexual abuse. The Senate's confirmatory decision to wait is already a week until the FBI's investigation is completed.
But the primary objective of this series of collections is to help the Republicans to gain the advantage of the November elections.
Therefore, Trump's president's campaign staff report that five sets scheduled for the next week have the goal of "stimulating volunteers and consenting because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Most in Congress are so important to the presidential plans that they will travel to as many countries as we enter the burn campaign," Trump's anonymous speaker told Reuters.
Tonight's gathering to be held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract accessions from "Ohija and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
The Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday the second time in the last month. In that country he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of the Senate Republican Patrick Morrisey from West Virginia, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to help him improve the ranking in polls," said Politologist Simon Haedar from the University of West Virginia for Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team left its heart on the field before the individual raids on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the couple's rounds on Sunday afternoon might be exactly what Ryder Cup was supposed to convert.
"The wheel of happiness turns" is a phrase that is particularly valuable in sports and in which athletes believe, and especially in competitions such as this.
Who's the lucky bike now?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four, so I think happiness is on our side right now," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans are in favour of four points, while 12 points remain until the end of the game.
Speeth says the Americans got a little wind in his back and encouraged his game in a pair with Justin Thomas, with which he won three out of four points after a day's game.
Speeth played dead from tea to green and can serve as an example to others.
Famous celebrations became more louder when Spieth and Thomas came to two points behind, and everything culminated in the key path by which Spieth came to an unresolved result.
After the trip that won the 15-hole game, a similar vulnerabilities were followed in which hope and faith can be recognized that the Americans can turn everything around.
"You just need to concentrate and think about your game," Spieth said.
The team's all that's left for the players now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup sensation.
A strange European couple has a maximum number of points and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't lose score on Saturday afternoon, but he also escaped Bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nine on Friday morning.
The winning series, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinaria, show that it is just those players that should win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them who can seal the victory of the Europeans while the sun rises above the Paris Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time on different holes.
But it's too early to talk about the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly got Alex Norena and Sergey Garcie, who had a great performance in this morning's game of couples.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes in the playground buried Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they failed to dig.
However, on Sunday, there will be no one to help individuals get out of their holes.
It's fascinating to watch couples games nearby because you can see the interaction of players in couples, hear advice that they don't give, as well as study a strategy that can be changed at the moment.
Europeans have so far played better as a team, and in the last day they are entering with considerable prejudice, but this game in couples has also shown that the US team has the necessary struggle, in which some, especially the Stateside, have doubted.
Europeans in the last day Ryder Cup coming in with the lead from 10 : 6
After Saturday's games in couples in the last day Ryder Cup are entering with a significant priority over the United States at 10: 6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods led by four points of difference to Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorna, trying to win a trophy that escaped her in Hazeltina two years ago, was more powerful than the American team in the morning games in couples achieving the result of 3 : 1.
The American team showed greater fighting in couples winning two games, but the difference in points was already great.
To win the game, Jim Furyk team needs to collect eight points in 12 single games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first debitant from a European team that won four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Mollwood", after a sensational weekend, only another couple who won four points in a game in pairs in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they showed themselves to the superpowers in the game against Woods and American deputed Bryson Dechambeau by winning 5&4.
Woods, who didn't show the best performance in two Saturday games, made some brilliant moves, but now there's 19 defeats of 29 games in fourballs and couples and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused morning fourballs to go back to the game with the couples and suffered a 2&1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
But the Europeans didn't exactly go like a bit of an undersea during a pleasant day in the southeastern part of Paris.
The triple winner Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday, so they put the flag on top of their American team.
First they defeated Spanish Jon Rahma and Ian Poulter with a result of 2&1 in fourballs, and then defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy with 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the entire history of Ryder Cup a team that was behind four points managed to get back in individual games, although Fury's team only needs an unsolved result to keep the trophy.
After two days in the background, it seems that Sunday's counterattack will be hard for them.
North Korea has announced that "no chance" for one-sided untrustworthy disarmament
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday in front of the United Nations that further sanctions increase mistrust in the United States and that there is no way North Korea will be unilaterally disarmed and disarmed in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" last year, for example, stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear testing station and decided to halt the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"But we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
"If we don't trust the United States, we don't have faith in our national security, and under such circumstances there's no way we'll unarm ourselves on the first side."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known complaints of North Korea to Washington's resistance to the "probably" approach to denuclearisation in which the sanctions would be progressively lifted in North Korea, his statement is significant because he did not reject the unilateral denuclearisation as Pjonang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current president of the United States and the leaders of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on "the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump assured the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean war, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has required that Pyongyang renounce nuclear weapons before that.
Washington also ignored calls for the reduction of severe international sanctions for North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that early denuclearization is carried out and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal urgently, and even opposes "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri added.
"The perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is just the mistake of people who don't know anything about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases mistrust."
Ri didn't mention whether there were plans for another meeting of Kim and Trump, about which US President spoke at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
But the minister pointed out that Kim and the head of South Korea Moon Jae-in held even three meetings in the last five months and added: "If the denuclearization was seeking South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come to such a halt."
Regardless of everything, the tone of Minister Rija's speech differed greatly from last year's speech before the UN's General Assembly and said that the goal of the continental United States rockets was inevitable after evil President Trump called Kim "a human rocket" on a suicide mission.
The trump that threatened the "complete destruction" of North Korea this year in the United Nations praised Kim for his courage to disarm, but added that there was much more work to be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea carries out denuclearization.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no time frame for denuclearisation and added: "It is not important whether it will take two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of the UN Security Council said Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue strictly until complete, final and verifiable denuclearizations are reached."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions for North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop financing a nuclear and ballistic programme in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with rijem in the main UN assembly and then said he would visit Pjongang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said he had made progress, but North Korea called him after a few hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea has agreed a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile location and nuclear complex that will be achieved if the United States of America takes "responsible measures".
He added that Kim found out that these "relevant measures" relate to the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards the stabilisation of the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard attend a course on how to get a good rest
The new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to sleep well in an effort to fight the growing culture of learning with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students in the world's best university often have no idea of the basics of caring about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has come up with a course he considers to be the first of these species in the United States.
He came up with the idea of a course after he spoke about the effect of depressing sleep on learning.
At the end of the class, one girl came to me and said, "Why did I know this just now, in the last year of college?"
She said no one told her how important a dream was, which surprised me," The Telegraph said.
The course that takes place the first time this year explains to the students how good sleep habits help in academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University of Paul Barreira said the University decided to introduce a course after a serious lack of sleep was observed in students during the week.
The uniform course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a student bedroom on which students have to click the coffee cup, curtains, tennis and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how a lack of sleep affects success and how important a routine of sleep is.
During the course, students learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then there is a campus map with interactive icons that stimulates students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that students' behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," added Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride in learning all night before the exam still exists, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that the lack of sleep is a growing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and good dream. Sleep helps in the fight against obesity because a lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it in a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, 19-year-old student of chemistry and biology from California, helped Professor Cheisler to come up with a course after he attended his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to extend the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, he plans to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar study subject before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students include an alarm during sleep, as well as during awakening. They must be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic devices, as well as LED light that can disrupt the circular rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin goal defeat Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after the Dolly Menge shot down Steven Gerrard's lack of defense and ended the game with a liveston win with a result of 1:0.
The team from Ibrox wanted to achieve the first victory after the triumph in February and the result 4 : 1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his team now leaves eight points in the Ladbrokes Premiership for the leading Hearts.
Menga reached the story seven minutes before half-time, and Rangers seemed to have lost inspiration and didn't seem to balance the result.
While the Rangers were now falling to sixth place, Livingstone climbed to third with only one story of the difference behind the Hibernian.
There could be new problems for Rangers after line judge Calum Spence got a head injury when he was thrown out of a distance of an object.
Gerrard made eight shifts on the sides and so opposed by Ayra to half-final Betfred's cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same attitude of Livingstone that Hearts took action last week and would be thrilled to see his well-designed attitude stifled every attempt of the opponent.
The Rangers may have had more ball in their possession, but Livingstone made more of it.
They've had a chance to make it two minutes after Menga was first thrown out of the game that Scott Pittman opened the space to go to Allan McGregor's goal, however, the twin missed that opportunity.
The deep free hit by Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow could only pass an unprecise hit on the rear lines.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the games seemed to be playing with hope rather than with conviction.
Alfredo Morelos was sure to think the judge was supposed to bring him a one-star in 15 minutes after his match with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not consider Columbia's request.
The Rangers in the first half managed to lead only two balls towards the goal, but the former Ibrox's doorman Liam Kelly one hit with the head Lassane Coulibaly and the pitty hit of Ovie Ejarie did not pose a big problem.
Although the 34-minute playing of Livingstone slowed down the game, no one can deny their efforts.
The Rangers missed using Jacobs' deep ball again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added a ball to Scott Robinson, who retained his presence and chose Mengu for a simple end to the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had a current effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingstone continued to attract visitors to exactly the same game they enjoyed while Lithuania and Halket made a long shot at each other.
Holt's side could have extended the leadership in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Litgow made a wide entrance from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton was looking again late for a one-star because he broke up with Jacobs, but Thomson and this time turned his eyes.
Almanah: Geiger's inventor
And now the following page from our Almanah on Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago ...the birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hansa" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed the method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, and from this invention later developed the device known as Geiger's numerator.
Since that time, Geiger's main advocate of science has also become the pop culture, for example in the 1950's "Bells of Colorado" film, in which the main roles were apparently incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's counter, and it's used to discover radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these hearing aids, you can actually hear atoms reacting to radioactive activity in minerals."
Evans: "Look at this, that's what's heard!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that carries his name still lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach an immunological system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and destroy them
"The vaccine teaches the immune system that as part of treatment it recognizes bad cells
The procedure includes removing the immune system cells from the patient and changing them to the laboratory.
The cells are treated so that they can "recognize" the protein that is common to many types of cancer and then reinject into the patient.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immunological system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has been withdrawn for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the removal of the immune system cells from the patient, their modification to the laboratory in order to "recognize" the protein called HER2, which is common to many types of cancer and reinjection of the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer in the City of Bethesda in the Federal State of Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 stimulates growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung cancer and thick intestine cancer," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to withdrawing the immune system cells from the patient and their "learning" how to identify cancer cells was successful in treating one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, after hosting the Saturday Night Live show, joined the discussion about Trump and supported him, wearing a hat with the title "Make America Great again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West graduated from the study during the Saturday Night Live show after the event with the interruptions in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for the president of 2020.
After performing the third song of the evening, called Ghost Town during which he wore a hat with the title "Make America Great again", he continued to speak against the democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk so often to white people, and they say to me, "How you like Trump, he's a racist."
Well, if I were to worry about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday Night Live show began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video of West's speech on the social network was broadcast by the comicist Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock was trying to rape West by the announcement.
Also, West complained to the public that he was being thrown behind the scenes because of the hat he was wearing.
"I was harassed behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go with that hat."
They abused me!
They said I drowned," said Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom?" and said he would wear his Superman's coat because that means I can't tell him what to do.
Try with love."
The magazine Variety wrote that his comments at least twice provoked the public abuse, and members of the Saturday Night Live show were embarrassed, while one of the people for the magazine said, "The whole studio has shut down."
West was last called as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
The West performed the song "I Love It", dressed like a bottle of mineral water Perrier, surprised many.
Westa supported Candace Turner, head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, who announced on Twitter: "One of the bravest people: Thank you for being a mafia."
But the director of the show Karen Hunter on Twitter announced that West was simply "his own and that it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his "artificial") for whom I believe he accepts and extends the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he changed his name, saying he will now be "officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, who's also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, the reper Snoop Dogg, called Snoop Lion, and of course, lost the musical legend Prince changed her name into a symbol, and then in an artist previously known as Prince.
Charge for attempted murder by knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of trying to kill a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The police reported an incident in Ballyhackamore.
The accused should appear before the Constitutional Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the prosecution.
The star of the Presbyterian Games Kit Harington turned to toxic masculineity
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snow that is cheap in the HBO's violent medieval fantasy of the throne game.
But a 31-year-old actor turned to a stereotype cat hero, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel that they have to be strong to gain respect.
In a speech on The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic husbandhood in #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married a 31-year-old colleague of Rose Leslie from the Presbyterian Games series, admitted that he wanted to "very determined" to face this problem.
"I personally feel very determined at this moment – where we made a mistake with the marriage?" he asked.
"What did we teach men, as they grew up, in relation to the problem we now see?"
Kit believes that television, thanks to very male figures on the screen, could partly be responsible for the increase of toxic masculinity.
He went on to say: “What was born, and what was taught?
What do you learn from the TV and the streets, and that makes the boys feel they have to have these certain drawings of men?
I think it's actually one of the big questions of our time — how can we change it?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for the boys.'
He also admitted in the interview that he would not record the follow-up to the Presbyterian Games at the end of next summer and said he "ends with warriors and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a new performance by True West author Sam Shepard, a film producer and his brother's robberyr.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting Rose's wife was the best thing that happened to him during the recording of the Presbyterian Games.
"I met my wife filming that series, which gave me my family and my future life," he discovered.
Rose in a fantastic series that won Emmy's award played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow.
Couple married in June 2018 on the possession of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported an increase in new disease cases of 14 %
China has announced that 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS has grown.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
About 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases of infection have been transmitted by sex, which has been changed in relation to the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout some parts of China as a result of a blood transfusion.
At a conference in the province of Yunnan, the Chinese health authorities said that the person infected with HIV in this way is almost gone.
Every year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000.
The introduction of a HIV sex virus is a constant problem between the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997 in China, but it is said that the discrimination of LGBT is a large person.
Research estimates that, due to the country's conservative values, between 70 and 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of disease in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of the effort to cope with this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV in 2003.
Maxine Waters objected that a member of the public staff had given up information about the GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. representative Maxine Walters said on Saturday that a member of her staff had published personal data from three Republican US senators on Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic representative from Los Angeles believes that the claims spread to individuals "ultra right wing", as well as to websites.
"Truths, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hatcha, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, and it was published by an unknown person with Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate committee on allegations of sexual misconduct by the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after the three senators were interviewed by Kavanaugh.
Conservation sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of the publication of this data belongs to the Waters representative's office, as well as information about the representative's staff member, reported The Hill newspaper.
"These unsubstantiated instructions are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false and false instructions – is not at all responsible for the leaking of those data.
These unsubstantiated instructions are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Mrs. Waters' statement quickly attracted internet critics, including former White House Speaker Aria Flescher.
"This is an angry denial," Flescher wrote.
"It shows that Waters has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do must not be angry.
It can't be overcrowded.
He must not reexamine the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and steady."
It was felt that Fleischer compared the reaction of Barbara Walters to the criticisms that democracy has directed to the judge of Kavanaugh, who was accused of becoming too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who competes in general elections against Waters, also posted on Twitter.
"It's important if it's true," he wrote.
Watersova stated in her statement that her office had announced these false claims "modern bodies and order bodies".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they bear legal consequences for all the actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
Review of the film "Johnny English: Again on the job" – not interesting Rowan Atkinson fights the spy
Now it is already customary in every new British film to ask for messages about Brexit, and it seems that it is also in the new screen of the action series "Johnny English" whose first follow-up, called "Johnny English", was first shown in 2003 and returned to large screens entitled "Johnny English Again".
Will our own satire about how worthless we are to become a new national export opportunity?
The incapacitated Johnny English-based eye and rubber face again has permission to complicate the situation, while his name speaks more than anything about a comical creation for a wide audience designed for countries in which cinematography is not in English.
He is, of course, a secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims on the "distributed" glamorously reminds Inspector Clouseau, has a wealth of character, Mr Bean, and a little reminds of that guy who played one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the 2012 London Olympics ceremony.
His character is also inspired by a passenger and a mysterious world man who Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and who is a healing of chaos.
There's one or two hot moments in this latest movie release.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the propeller just hit his helmet.
Atkinson's physical comedy talent is visible, but humour is perceived to be quite uninterested and unusually superior, especially now that "real" film titles such as "007" and " improbable missions" and themselves offer comedy elements.
Humor is felt as if it were intended for children, not adults, and I think the decommissioned stories of Johnny English are not as innovative and focused as those Atkinson's non-gags are embedded in Mr Bean's character.
The assumption that Britain is in serious trouble is now a general fact.
Hacker entered the most secret British spy web network and discovered the identities of all British agents, to the horror of an agent on duty, which unfortunately recently appeared as Kevin Eldon.
It was a glass of the prime minister's patience, superpower and warlord's who is experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he's politically hated: Emma Thompson is trying to prove himself faithful to a person who should represent Theresa May, but she didn't really get the material to do anything with.
Reporting advisers reveal that all active spies are compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate the retired agent.
And this person will be unwarranted by Johnny English's head and beard who is currently employed as the director of some retired school, but passengers teach how to become a secret agent: here there are a few hot gegoes because English teaches rock-style spying.
English quickly brings the government room to an emergency meeting, where he will meet Bough again, his former partner and his eternal victim, whom Ben Miller plays.
Bough is now married to an over-excited submarine commander who plays Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely lost.
And so the two members of the Secret Service of Her Majesty who are doing everything entirely wrong return to action and meet a beautiful fatal woman, Opheli Bulletov, who has captured Olga Curylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the evil Jason Volta acting as Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their exciting journey with absurd and funny stories: crushed in the canoes of a decommissioned French restaurant, the challenge of a huge mess of traversing on Voltina's luxury yacht, and English challenges a complete anarchy trying to use the hearing aids for virtual reality to find out what the inner inside of Voltina's house looks like.
Everything has been done properly for this last follow-up, but no matter how attractive and reasonable the film is, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
Pretty central achievement.
And as was the case with other films about Johnny English, I was wondering if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would match his talent?
The Labour Party rejects to draw up a plan for the British to work four days a week, and will be paid in five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party will consider a radical plan that British would work for four days a week and be paid for five-day work.
The party allegedly wants the heads of companies to save the past workers from the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and give them an additional day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources indicate that the idea could be "applied" in a side-by-side economic programme and plans to attract the country to the interests of workers.
The union congress supports shifting to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high source from the Labour Party said of the "The Sunday Times": "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not be achieved overnight, but represents an effort that fits the approach that this party has to balance the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept that trend.
The spokesman for the Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not the party's policy and the party does not consider it."
The shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, took advantage of the last week's Labour Party conference to draw up his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to transfer the power from the hands of "beginners" and "professors" in municipal companies.
The plans of the office in the shadow also mean that current shareholders in the water management companies may not be able to recover their overall role because the Labour Government could make "debts" based on perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to involve employees in the company's administrative committees and create inclusive own funds to give 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, who would make annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation about Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugha suspended the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least a week and asked whether the Agency's conclusion could affect the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, author of 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether there was a possibility that the FBI would discover something that would force them to change their mind.
Kennedy felt more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said going to the debate, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after he had been taken from you, and he said, "Have you done this?"
He was determined, uncomplicated, unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, looks like he's stuck in a rock.
"I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and you really should be strongly accused of changing it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett rejected everything strongly," Graham added, thinking about Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the person she nominated could confirm her claim.
It's been 36 years since.
I don't see anything has changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – the end of poverty in the world.
For the past seven years, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of the stars, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raised awareness of the real objective of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Powery Project, an international group of advocates hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free event ticket (unless they were willing to pay a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "work" such as volunteering, e-mailing to world leaders, telephone calls or any other meaningful ways of raising awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen actually, given that he has 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of awarding people for free a concert the right way to convince people that they require a call for action, or just another case called "clickivism" – where people feel that signing an online petition or sending a tweet really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said that more than 19 million "action" of its ports have been marked, which have sought to achieve a range of different objectives.
It claims that these actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to an amount of over 37 billion dollars that will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group imposed 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and administrators in the United Kingdom that is committed to "helping children develop to their full potential", with promise that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the world, 35 million dollars will be provided to help Rwanda with the aim of ending poverty in this area.
"With the help of the government of the United Kingdom, donor, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can achieve that social injustice of nutrition becomes only a fuss in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Foundation "The Power of Nutrition", published at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions were undertaken to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the "The Power of Nutrition" project, which will provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on your website, which says, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?",
The Global Citizen answers: “It will be a long and difficult time sometimes we will experience failure.
But we're going to succeed, just as they did, and big moves for citizens' rights and against apartheid before us, because we're stronger together.
The performances Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae belong to some of the performances on this year's New York event that will lead Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington may, "if necessary", use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, has discovered US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner weekly says.
Zinke said Russian involvement in Syria is particularly where the legitimate government calls for an excuse for investigating new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason Russia is in the Middle East is that it wants to sell energy in that area, as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he says.
But according to him, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of maritime routes and the blockade, if necessary, in order to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants to the event whose host was a non-profit group of Consumer Energy Alliance, which is represented in the US as "a voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually the same.
"The Iranian and Russian Lord's Option is more or less the use and replacement of fuel," he said, and for Russia he said "uses the same trick" in economies dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements are dated at the same time with the intention of Trump's administration to increase exports of its oiled natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, officials of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 (North Stream 2) pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin "captive" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project has simply been driven by economic reasons and that the example of unfair competition is an example.
"I believe that we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stand-alone caused Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called for the US to clone EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country becomes involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the possibility of running for the president of 2020," says US Senator Massachusetts
The federal senator, Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that he would "consider seriously" the presidential candidacy after the mid-term elections.
During a direct meeting with the citizens of Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he thought he was running himself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means a woman on the forehead," The Hill said.
"After the 6th of November, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for the president."
Warren gave an opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying that "this country is leading in the wrong direction".
"I'm terribly worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet released on Friday, Warren says, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not think that they should be running in 2020.
According to a study by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Suffolk / Boston Globe, 50 percent of the "trustful" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% of the votes for the potential candidacy and 48% against.
The remaining prominent names of the Democrats discussed in connection with a potential race for the President of 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Budden said he'd make an official decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSP Track Palina at the gathering Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after reporting in September.
He was arrested and accused of family violence that happened on Monday night
"What goes through my son, what goes through after his return, is comparable to other families that feel the consequences of PTSP and other wounds our soldiers are returning with," said the audience at Donald Trump's meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the general problem he was talking about, and for his son and other war veterans he said that "they are returning a little different, they return firmly, they are returning wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the army have given to this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilli, Alaska, and charged with family violence against a woman, the failure to report family violence and possession of alcoholized weapons, says Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the city's Police Administration of Wasille.
18 federal states and D.C. support the re-examination of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that undermines asylum for victims fleeing from the gang or violence in the family.
Representatives of the 18 federal states and the county submitted a friendly report Friday in Washington to provide support to asylum seekers who are slowing down politics, NBC News reports.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against Sessions, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal politics was not revealed.
She said her partner "and violent gang members" abused her, but US officials refused her asylum claim on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States come, as countries facing current gang and family violence problems.
The new asylum policy in the United States has changed the decision of the Immigration Committee in 2014 which has been made to immigrants who do not have documents and flee from violence in the family, allowed them to submit an application for asylum.
State lawyer from the Colombian District Carl Racine said in his statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"The Federal Law states that all asylum claims are resolved on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances of the complaint, and such a restriction violates that principle," the report of a friend of the court states.
The lawyers further stated that the policy that undermines the entry of immigrants harms the US economy, claiming it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour force".
Chief State Advocate Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to cease to approve asylum for victims fleeing family violence and gang violence in June.
"Azil is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in its statement on policy on 11 June.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems and even all the serious problems people face every day throughout the world.
A desperate rescue effort in Palu as the number of victims doubled in the race for finding survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting harder.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, while she comforted her boy who was in a fever in the evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"The ambulance will help every minute of the body's import.
The government is depriving clean water."
The residents have been seen returning to their ruined homes, reading through floodwaters, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by 7.5 degrees, were hookers.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who suffered a break in the back and shoulder, rested in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated openly due to continued severe postpartum shocks.
The tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of a violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pushed inside the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, and added that his family had come to the city to get married.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then silence followed.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "mutilation" through "propaganda ads"
A week after official Chinese newspapers published four pages of a long ad in the US daily list that promoted the mutual benefit of US and China trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of misusing the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump addressed a paid supplement to China Daily in the most sold newspapers in Iowa, Des Moines Register, on Wednesday, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the American Congress elections on 6 November, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to get involved in the American elections marked what US officials in Reuters statement have characterized as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
Although it is normal for governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in the escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's refusal at the start of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, reports Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, a US ambassador to China and former Governor Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said that Beijing had injured US workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in the Sunday issue of the newspaper Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China "now doubles this abuse by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid ads in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, you will find limited voices of opposition on the street in Beijing, and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's disturbing economic journey because the media are under strong pressure from the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which papers were in question.
The Republicans have removed voters from the Cavanaug debacle before the mid-term elections, warning analysts
Since many Republicans are standing with the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and defend him with a few sexual abuse instructions, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were quite excited, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their voice.
Such things can't be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that the last instigation of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to put an end to the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, and they won't forget it tomorrow, nor in the cold," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national speaker of the Progressive Group MoveOn, quoted the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang, "Come in cold!", protesting in the Senate hall while the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee were preparing to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite witness to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats will be beyond all expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-citizen political analyst.
"People say they are already at a high level, which is true.
But they could be even higher, especially among women in suburbs and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they don't like the president, often do not go to the elections."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which her allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court candidate have been detailed, analysts suggest that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans continue to confirm.
"It's a real mess for the Great Old Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, NBC News.
"This is not only about voting in committee or final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh has been sent to the savings club, but also about how the Republicans have access to it and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that assists in the election of Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about whom they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more insistence on him.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe in the truth of Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believe in Kavanaugh as sure or likely.
In addition, 38% said he thought that Kavanaugh probably lied or definitely during his testimony, while only 30% claimed the same for Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations Ford brought, along with at least one more prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Fordova testified before the Senate's Judicial Committee on the oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that her candidate for the Supreme Court's trial showed her genitals at the party during a study at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet for download of Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology, Inrupt, is a company that develops on the basis of Berners-Lee's open solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and people to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee dealt with the intention behind the Inrupt "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said thinking about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal network storage" or POD.
It can contain contact descriptions, commitment descriptions, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that the decision is about who can access which information fully to the user.
The company calls it "the personal support of the data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to Chief Executive Director John Bruce, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Brucea, security platforms purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a project work contract, as well as a community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, development engineers from around the world have been able to make their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a press release on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission was "to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of new networks built on Soleda."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded a World Wide Web consortium at the State Institute of Technology in Massachusetts (MIT).
Last month, Berners-Lee had an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even while Inrupt is running, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating Priests of World War I Victorian Cross
Celebrations in honor of the only Anglican priest who was distinguished by the Victorian Cross as a fighter in the First World War were made in his hometown 100 years later .
Colonel Bernard Vann won the September 29, 1918 prize in an attack on Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had received the greatest British military honor.
The monument was discovered by two of his grandsons at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's wish to receive his confession.
According to the London Gazette official's report, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through St. Quentin's channel "through a very dense fog and under a strong fire that came from the direction of the battlefield and the machine".
Later, he raced in the first row and with "incredibly bravery" led the crew forward before he ran without anyone's help to the Polish top and cut three out of the military squad.
Colonel Vanna killed a German sniper on 4th October 1918. Something more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I know I could never achieve, and that it stimulates humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed the winery after the parade, led by the parade orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very honored to participate in the paradise" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
The lovers of mixed martial arts remained awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got the Peach of Peppu
Imagine this you stay awake all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches in order to eventually be unable to track the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the United Kingdom live on channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just when Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, viewers in the United Kingdom were shocked when the transfer ended Praščić Pappa.
Many were not impressed after only the fighting remained awake until early morning hours.
One fan of the end of the children's cartoons on Twitter described it as "a kind of sick joke".
"According to the state regulation, this content is not suitable for broadcast at 6 o'clock in the morning, so they had to transfer it to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, the senior vice president of marketing and communication Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
"Jupi, "Peppa's "Peppa."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said he would coordinate his plans to include visitors from Britain in the future.
"When I consider reprisals, I think we can probably fix something," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to accomplish anything until we get there on Sunday, when they're already on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transfer was interrupted, there were many inscriptions that weren't even friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't.
I can promise you the next time it won't come.
We're gonna keep five fights instead of six what we're doing, and we've been trying to give more to our fans, but we've been over-exposed.
It's a matter of unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to be successful.
Twenty-four years old said that until he went to high school, he wasn't aware that "all are not like me."
In his statement on Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hope".
He also said that his victory in the Olympic Games was less important since he became a father.
The regular director of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of the disease.
When he appeared as a waste in Laverna's first show, Daley said that during his childhood he felt "less valuable" in relation to others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said: “To this day your feelings of inferiority and diversity in relation to others have been real things that gave me power and strength so that I could succeed. ”
He said he wanted to prove that he was "something and something", so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medal became a prominent person who advocates for LGBT persons and has taken advantage of his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia in order to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give others "hope".
The triple world champion said he was surprised that he fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an uncle, who was 20 years older than he was last year, but he said that the difference in years had never been his problem.
"When you're so young, you're going through so much," he turned to his first Olympic game when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said it's hard to find someone of the same years and experience similar ups and downs.
In June they became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, all the stories would be about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
Robbie's my gold Olympic medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they got tickets to London in 2012.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in the first order," he said.
"I held him by the hand while he was breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died, I finally realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I only knew it was what I had dreamed of my whole life to jump in front of the home audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration to choose the first song of the "Proud" singer Heather Small , who was part of it during the preparation for the Olympic Games and which she always sits on .
Desert Island Disks is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mikkelson outside the shape of the club on Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to completely recover his form to avoid an unpleasant shift.
Mikkelson, who played the record 12th time in this two-year game, sent Captain Jim Fury to the club in the Saturday games with four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as was often for the United States, a five-fold winner spent the day in praising and distributing his games at the gym in hopes of correcting what was bothering him.
Never the most precise player, even at the top of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the Le Golf National demand field, where the long nervous field routine punishments unprecise hits.
And if I'm not scary enough, Mikkelson, on the ninth Sunday, faces a precise British Open Francesc Molinary champion, who won all four matches this week with the latest Tommy Fleetwood.
If Americans, who start 12 single games with four points less, come to a hot start, Mikkelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Fury said he had confidence in his man more than that and couldn't say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, hit me on his back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"There's a lot of confidence."
He's famous and has contributed a lot to teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine playing two games.
I imagined there would be more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we should do it.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
Mikkelson will record Nick Fall on Sunday by the number of games Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of his career in Ryder's purchase that has never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Fury said his presence brought certain intangible values to it.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for it," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving a lot more than the game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily be turned into an uncomfortable race.
Danac debuted in a game in Valderrami in 1997, where the team of Captain Seve Ballesterosa had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a weight difference of 141⁄2 1⁄2 1⁄2.
"You always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a strong difference," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 team, who won the 5rd score on Friday and yesterday led the 10th score on Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll play with full power.
Get out on the field and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floors are on the panel.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I talk all the time, I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we are certainly aware of who is standing against us -- the biggest players in the world."
Excited by the performance of his players in the heavy golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run in this direction.
Tomorrow it's worth dealing with a different beast.
Tomorrow are the main individual performances, and that's something different.
It's great to play with a partner when it's all right, but when you're there as an individual, at the end of the exam your ability to golf players.
It's a message that you need to pass on to the players, and it's that they have to give the best of themselves tomorrow.
Now leave your playmate because he has to give the best of himself too."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague on the other side, Jim Fury, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with the players, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points of four.
Fury himself was on both sides of these great revolutions last day, since he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe performed "a miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning, like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that swing goes in a certain direction, he puts great pressure on the middle swords.
In line with that, we organized our position and set up the boys as if we were, you know, trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned a task of trying to prevent a counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmu, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I've decided that this group of guys is going in this order because I think it's covering everything," Bjorn said about selected players for individual matches.
German new warship reset to wait
The latest frigate of the German Navy was to be released in 2014 to replace old warships from the cold war, but will not be ready at least until next year due to incorrect systems and increased costs, local media reported.
The launch of the Rhineland-Pfalz ship, a leading ship of completely new Frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now delayed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit by referring to the military speaker.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying problems after delivery hit the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, which the sailor ordered in 2007, will replace the old frigate class Bremen.
As well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures, will have a strong top, a series of anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking missiles.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods Õ should be possible to distribute the latest frigates during the period up to two years without returning to the mother’s port.
However, constant delays mean that the most recent warships that Germany is said to have been able to display power abroad will already become obsolete by the time of entry into service, the Die Zeit.
Unlucky frigate F125 reached all the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a sailor has returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted numerous key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would make the warship useless if it were sent to a combat mission.
The lack of software was particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships will run a crew of about 120 sailors Õ half the size of Bremen.
It also showed that the ship is a dramatic overload that reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the sailor to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tonnes is twice the weight of the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the cost of the whole project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that the price has reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German maritime force is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Defence Parliament Committee, admitted that sailors actually "stand on ships capable of deployment".
The officer said that the problem had increased over time, because the old ships had been put out of operation, and there were no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates can join the Navy.
The National Foundation Listens to the Secret Life of Shrimp
The aim of the new research carried out at the property in Scotland is to find out how bats use the area in food hunting.
There is hope that the results will clarify the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to conduct future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists at the National Scottish Foundation (NTS) will follow the usual and wet-rooted bats, as well as brown long and river bats in the gardens of Inverewe in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor mouse activity throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile checks using hand detectors.
The technical analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the shingles and what kind of sound it is.
Then a map will be drawn and a report will be made to create a detailed picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Adviser, hopes the results will find out which areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of work on housing management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other associated species.
The populations of Shishmisha in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have significantly decreased over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and work on a device that affects shelters and the loss of homes.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can mussels and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by cats of animals.
The Shischis aren't really blind.
However, because of their night fishing habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles on the way of their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, shishmisha takes very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, shelter inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the property of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats are living in Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the property is an ideal area for them.
"Here in Thrave we have a huge space for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good buildings.
However, there is much more that we don't know about mice, so the work we do here and on other objects will help us to better understand what they need for progress."
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting work on maintenance inside the building, since accidental destruction of one bed can kill up to 400 women and young people, thereby likely destroying the entire local population.
The mice are protected and unlawfully killed, tortured or disturbed or destroyed their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Scottish Shislim Protection Association, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their population is moving forward."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers are preparing to prosecute German journals
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as "false news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which has published these accusations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rape by the American on behalf of Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he paid her $375 000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video that he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the allegations as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," says a five-year-old gold ball winner in the camera.
"They want to promote using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," added the footballer with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for saying that they called "an unacceptable report on privacy concerns", says Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the football player will be looking for a reward for "moral damage to the amount that corresponds to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious personal injuries in the last few years."
It is mentioned how the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the hotel apartment and the Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, as reported, returned to the football room, where he reportedly raped her, is listed in documents submitted in the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99 percent" was the "good guy" he failed that "one percent".
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that he was agreed upon.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she had been photographed injuries in the hospital, but that she later agreed to an overseas deal because she was "fearing revenge" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
Thirty-four-year-old says she wants to cancel the deal now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian wilderness of Juve to a transfer worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will "always repent" which has lost car manufacturers
The UK will "fall forever" if after Brexit the world leader's status in car manufacturing has been lost, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "disturbing" that Toyota UK told the BBC that, in case Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of waiting at the borders in the case of Brexit could cause loss of jobs without agreement.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis production of nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My position is that if Britain finally leaves the EU without an agreement, we will experience the halt of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General Toyotin in Burnston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed fears about leaving the EU without an agreement due to possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he's going to close his Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturer relate to the risks in the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement reached.
Toyota's production line works according to the "just in time" principle, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers to the UK and EU for cars operating by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could come to an end on the border for which industry says it could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota in her factory in Derbyshire could not keep more supplies than they needed for one day, they said from that company, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said the "Checkers" plan offers Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need to agree. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will enable, as I say, not only to keep the present success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4 programme today.
"The evidence not only toyote, but also other manufacturers show that we must be absolutely able to continue this very successful range of supply chains."
In Toyota, they could not say how long production could be stopped, but they warned that long-term viewing, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnston for 24 years and who is a member of the United States trade union, said that his members are becoming increasingly concerned: “After my experience, after they leave, they never come back. ”
The government spokesman says: "We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with the deputy national lawyer Rod Rosenstein could "be delayed for another week" as the fight continues about the candidate for the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, the relationship between Trump's collaborators and Russia, and the possible interference of justice by the president.
The question is whether Trump is going to fire a deputy state attorney, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, but for months he's been disavowing the tapes in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been discussing the transmission of a wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president from the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the middle of a announcement that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with the hearing of the Senate's Judicial Committee in which they testified to Kavanaugh and one of the women charged with sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, which further slowed the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on a Sunday on Fox News.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not specified, it could be this week; it could be postponed for another week, considering all the rest of what is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to inform the press about everything."
Some journalists would object to this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Leader Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of a press conference is not a consequence of resistance to the "theatrical behaviour" of television reporters, although he said, "I will not resist the facts to be confused."
Then she pointed out that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president organizes more meetings for answers to questions than any president before him," said, adding without giving evidence: "We have analysed the numbers."
A brief speech will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to ask the US president directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We have often tried to make this possible, and you have seen it in the last few weeks, and that's exactly what you can talk to the president of the United States will change the short address to journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of the assembled journalists.
Ministry of Health writes to EU workers employed in the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health has sent a letter to EU staff employed in Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already committed itself to supporting the costs of applying for the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal have continued, moving towards the expected decisions of this fall.
But the government of the United Kingdom also reinforces preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would now like to see how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
EU-wide colleagues, as well as wider, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie subjected to an emergency after head injury
The line player of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury in a Saturday defeat by the Vanderbilt Commodores Club, with a result of 31 August 27, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Master Coach Tennessee, Rod Reed, told reporters that the accident happened just before the mid-term.
"He came to the playground line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field before they put it on the nose and sent it to further searches.
State University representative Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was no "type/range of injury" detail and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student from a two-year playground, plays the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday he had a total of five rounds before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 rounds in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher charge when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
According to new conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher charge for buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people
That step will neutralize Corby's efforts to attract young voters
The tax increase will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Risnica expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher charge when buying real estate in the United Kingdom Õ and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be understood as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters to promises to secure more decent housing solutions and to focus on those with high wages.
The increase in taxation will be paid by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will contribute to government efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee Õ which is charged to the current fee, including an increase which was added two years ago to other houses and properties purchased for issue may also be up to three percent.
This move is expected to raise 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London buy residents who do not have a home in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first real estate to join the company of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country Õ, especially in the capital city, have become "the cities of spirits" because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy only followed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax reduction to help a larger number of young people come to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking up but not using the country, and urged Ms. May to resign from the quota to price-favoured real estate in order to correct the "hate for the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including housing controls and the end of any investment.
He also wants to give the council greater powers to build new homes.
“ Last year, ” said Mrs. May, “I said that I would dedicate my term to renewing the British dream that every new generation should have a better life.
And that means repairing our housing market failure.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it can't be right that individuals who don't live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with birth abroad, can easily buy homes as well as the valuable British.
The dream of home possession has become far too far, and the shame of homelessness is still quite real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross said his "final ambition" was one day to become Scotland's manager.
Scotland (42) enjoys the challenge of revitalizing the North-East Club, which currently takes third place in the First League, with three points less than the leaders.
This summer, he moved to the stadium of light after the last season he again led St. Mirren to the Scottish Football Championship.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always dragged me back.
But this opportunity could still be achieved only if I was successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors in the seat of Governor Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neilla, Roy Keane, Gus Poyeta and Paul Di Cania.
Former Chief Allo Athletic says he's not afraid because he inherits such famous names in such a big club, after he previously declined calls to Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this moment will be measured on whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably consider myself successful only if I could get the club back there."
Ross completed his third year of managerial career, after which he was an assistant chief in Dumbarton and a 15-month experience as part of Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped Alloi recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of falling to the winner's title of the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real intersection," Alloe recalled.
"I really believed that managing is what suits me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I was doing well, working hard and enjoying pretty successful moments.
But the game can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure on the job, but management seems like the right thing.
I've always wanted to run, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for the paint is at 17:30 on Saturday, as research shows
The summer heat wave increased the income of British pubs who were struggling with finance, but increased the pressure on the launch of the restaurant.
The data show that pubs and bars have increased income in July by 2.7 per cent, but revenues in restaurants have decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the Business Consultant's Office of the Chief Manager of Business Books, who collected the data, said: "The continuation of the nice time and participation of England at the World Championship, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when the revenues of the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, with the fact that the restaurants were now even more hit.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the revenues of the restaurants in June just got worse in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mainly served have achieved much greater gains under equal conditions as regards losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is mainly served also suffered heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the controlled beer and bar sales, the drinking increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and the food sales increased by three percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst of RSM for vacation and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the foreign market.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to struggle with difficulties, although the sales drop of 4.8 per cent per annum will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
Long hot summer it couldn't have come up in time for local leaders serving food, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the necessary lessons."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, amounted to 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting slowing the growth of trade marks.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes data on the efficiency of 47 operating groups, with a total traffic of over 9 billion pounds, and an industrial reference value is established.
One of the five children has secret accounts on social networks hiding from their parents
Research reveals that one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks hiding from their parents and teachers.
Study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
The news boosted the fear of the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that hide adults.
The survey that included 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" accounts, referring to the web site for photo sharing.
The news strengthened the fear of the publication of sexual content.
Twenty-one percent of students said they used a clean "main" account to show their parents, while at the same time having private accounts.
One mother who found on the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged in other words "strengthen me".
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of which admit to own private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's very worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online places where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be "a voice of athletes" in the Scottish athletic committee
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual administrative body meeting.
Doyle is the most outstanding Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who run sports to take advantage of her extensive experience acquired internationally over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly by making him a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be a sportsman's voice and hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
The American, who won a 200-400m race at the 1996 game in Atlanta, of his total four Olympic gold, and now a regular BBC expert, after a passing ischemic attack, could no longer walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it would only be time to see if I would recover.
It was hard, but he recovered completely, learned to walk again and today to practice agility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages."
Shared views on the Internet about a publisher who compares mothers to cows
A company for the production of publishers with its advertising that mothers breast-feed their children compared to cows that the husband has developed shared views on the Internet.
In order to mark the launch of a product that claims to be "the first silent publisher in the world", Elvie for Consumer Technology announced an advertisement inspired by ironic music videos to show the freedom that the new publisher gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a state full of shade and cows with music whose text reads: "Yes, I am married to myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this isn't your voice, it's my chest."
Then comes the saying: “Expunge, pump, feed the baby with it, pump, pump, I'm married to my ladies.”
However, advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many say it lights up the "fears" of the dairy industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that they steal their children a few days after birth," one person wrote.
The publisher Elvie discreetly fits into the breast of the baby (Elvie/Mother)
Another person comments: “Explainably traumatic for a mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise the traitors to mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added, "A completely worthless commercial."
Others defended advertising, with one woman admitting her song as "exhibitive".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I could still get one, I'd buy one.
The delivery of milk made me feel just like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I figured it out the way it is.
This is a brilliant product," she said.
Another person commented: “This entertainment advertising is directed at mothers who issue milk (usually at their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like a ‘claim’.
This is not a advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they were all dancing with discreet traitors located in the bra.
The concept of campaign is based on the fact that many women who betray milk say they feel like cows.
The traitor Elvie is, however, completely silent, no wire or pipe and discreetly fits into the breast of the breast for the breast, allowing women to move freely, holding their babies, and even going out during the delivery.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother’s agency, commented: “Elvie’s publisher is so revolutionary a product that it deserves brave and challenging launch.
Making a parallel between showing women and cows, we wanted to focus on the issue and all its challenges, while at the same time in a fun and understandable way demonstrate the incredible feeling of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This is not the first time that the traitor Elvie has reached the headlines.
During London’s weekly fashion, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion trail for designer Marta Jakobowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children migrants quietly moved to camp at the border with Texas
The number of children detained has increased, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the heavy rhetoric and policies imposed by Trump's administration have made it difficult to accommodate children under the sponsor's care.
Traditionally, most sponsors were immigrants themselves without documents and were afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by what would happen and take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before the congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsoring minors without a follow-up.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 percent of the former arrested were not recorded in criminal records.
"Approximately 80% of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the country's home sponsors are illegal, and most of them are criminals.
That's why we keep searching for these individuals," Mr. Albenz said.
According to the shelter workers' statements, with a view to speeding up the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, which was previously standard.
Many will appear through videoconferencing, not personally, to bring their case before the immigration court for legal status.
Those who do not meet the aid criteria will be deported quickly.
According to workers' statements in shelters and reports that have emerged from the systems of the last months, which remain in custody for longer children, it is more likely that they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent disappearances or attempts to flee.
Protesters said that these concerns were expressed in larger objects such as Tornillo, where, because of its size, it is very likely that signs of the child being tortured will be avoided.
They added that moving children to a tent town without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to greet friends can cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although war in the country has lasted for eight years.
Mouale, who is also a deputy prime minister, said that the forces were legally on the Syrian soil, in the form of a fight against terrorism, and that they would "consistently be treated and treated".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," the congregation said.
Moualem insisted that "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, while millions have been left homeless.
He said Damascus will continue "a fight in this world until all Syrian territories are cleansed" of terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of strangers".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a war-damaged country.
As for the refugee, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were met and he blamed "some Western countries" for "widening irrational fears" that encouraged refugees not to return.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the war's end.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a zone buffer in the last major rebel rebellion Idlib created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented the mass attack of the Syrian forces, with Russia's support for the province in which three million people live.
Mouale, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed to the jihadists, including Nusra front fighters related to Al-Qaida, "who will be exploited".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to form a post-war constitution for Syria and open the way for elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, pointing out that the work of trust should be limited to "the revision of the articles of the present constitution" and warned against trust.
Why Trump will win the second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump should win again in the 2020 elections unless, for what many liberal observers are likely to hope, the objection and scandal will soon end his presidency.
In what would no doubt be "the most dramatic finals of the presidency ever!"
There's no sign of the viewer's murder right now.
Since 2014, visibility in the hit period has doubled by more than 1.05 million at the CNN and has almost tripled by 1.6 million at the MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million visitors in a hit-and-run period, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast exceeded the viewing with even 3.5 million viewers at the main news broadcast evenings.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, a producer of ABC's "Designed Survival" drama, about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of comedy and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
Her driver said he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he's smiling at me," said Mrs. Scowell.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the law on the pardon of the past from the Roe v. Wade procedure, can immigrant families be reunited as well as the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
However, you exceed the level of the informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts already for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of "deep background" for his book "Fear", about Paul Manafort's jacket of fine leather worth $15,000 (the "discovery item full of madness", writes Washington Post) and the implications of intimate descriptions, this, the anatomy of Mr. Trump giving Storm to Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, Super Maria will never look with the same eyes again.
"Part of what he makes you experience as a reality show is that I feed you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and the director of the Zlagaonica show, about the rotating performance and the daily tricks of Trump's show (a fight with N.F.L., praise Kim Jong-un).

When I arrived at Mr. Flesss this week, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauaija, it was sunny at 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside and watching the MSNBC and recorded CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging about the end.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money outside is left in the most uncertain mid-term election race for the congress
It is not surprising that 17th-century Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the reconstruction of the congressional districts that resulted in two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently reconstructed district of Pittsburgh's province stands out as a democrat, Connor Lamba, who won a place in another district in the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely in conflict with the new 17th district.
The cards were redesigned after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old circuits were continuously reduced in favour of the Republicans.
The new 17th round has launched a campaign to finance the campaign between the main party fund collectors, the Committee collecting funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a massive victory in the broad-based special March election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
This position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point preliminary district.
Political analysts gave little priority to democracy.
The United States should punish El Salvador for providing support to China, and then withdraw.
Diplomats have noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with the small resistance of Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel from Panama in June 2017 and hosted a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump's management team.
Officials of the State Department have decided to invite US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Speaker Heather Nauert.
However, the penalties were considered only against El Salvador, which received estimated US$ 140 million in 2017 for, among other things, control of drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including a reduction in financial aid and targeted critical restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high levels of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings have progressed, officials from North America and Central America have postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to continue a similar gathering last year, which was seen as progress in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
By mid-September, however, the senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and that they had actually interrupted any review of the sentence for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration adds to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or sentences from Washington.
Speaker of the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the particulars of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal debates on anonymity.
Their report confirmed an external analyst near the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next to be prepared could be a report by special investigator Robert Mueller on the possibility of Trump's prosecution, which is now very well-known public evidence.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, has also directed his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign is secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our elections.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he is prepared to stand before the voters again, and perhaps in the end and with the jury of levels.
It is a lot of these "if" and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trum's inevitable fall is neither those similar to him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officials were ready to execute a coup against Hitler, only that the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakian in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the victims.
History revolves around such points of inflation, and the unresolved march of democracy accelerates or is late.
The Americans are now facing a few of these points of inflation.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires a deputy state attorney, Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since these newspapers reported that last year he secretly proposed the president's recording and suspected his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if a recent FBI investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?"
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress, which Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall into those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I don't think we're going to fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to burn candles for scuba diving on that cuckoo table.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers are on Thursday to host Rapida from Vienna, knowing that they will win over the Austrians, after a impressive rhyme in Spain against Villarrell at the beginning of this month, to put themselves in a strong position to qualify from the Group of the G European League.
The knee wound prevented the wirer Graham Dorrans from showing up for the first time in the season until the 2nd season with Villarrela, but believes that Rangers can use that result as a jumping board for larger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villareal is a good opponent," a 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game believing that we could achieve something and we pulled out a point.
Maybe we could end up stealing the game, but, in general, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
There's another big European night on Thursday.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year it was definitely hard, between everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now it has some good feeling.
The boy is good and the boys really enjoy; training is good.
Let's hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that research participants had a clear commitment to the care they wanted, few people talked about it to their family members.
About half of the nationwide students said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want family members to worry about them, but they don't take steps to start the conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Security.
Here's where it starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, because your choices can be a significant factor in costing.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term care financing can include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with monetary value that will help you to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth as long as you have money.
Manage your legal documents: Prevent legal battles in the root.
Employ healthcare professionals to identify a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also consider giving full power to manage your finances.
You want to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your accounts if you are not able.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and that he is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer any questions about medications and allergies?
Enter the details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not just about finance, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan in your hand."
A man shot several times from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times by an air rifle on his way home after a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was located in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
The cops described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "symbolic act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Storms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, officials reported, and the number of dead is expected to rise.
Since the communications were interrupted, relief officers were unable to obtain any information from the province of Dongala, a region north of Palu, which is close to an epicenter of 7.5 degrees.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongali on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesia, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
It reached an area extending over 300 km of the coast to the north of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, the administrative region below the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of the province of Sulawesi, particularly the coastal regions of Dongal.
Nickel miners are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowoli, on the opposite coast of Sulawesia.
Paul and Dongal have been hit by a tsunami several times over the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongal.
Tsunami also hit the Western Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the West Coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the Sumatre coast.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, the most inhabited island in Indonesia, causing the tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pike earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Acehu, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the destruction of deadly earthquakes and tsunamis from 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died after the fall of the building.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for charges of violence in the family
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president, Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin (29), from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested due to suspicion of family violence, a failure to report family violence and arrest, a report published on Saturday by the Alaskan state police officer.
According to the police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in custody of Mat-Su and is detained on an unsecured $500 bond, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he explained "innocent, of course," the network reported.
Palina is charged for three Class A violations, which means she could be in prison for up to a year and punished with a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of a Class B breach, which is punishable by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $200.
It's not the first time Palina's criminal records have been filed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, invited the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Court of Justice of the Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with family violence, a failure to report family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholized state associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Saru Palin criticised the veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour to PTSP after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused the tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Networks for electricity and communications are broken, and the next few days the number of dead is expected to rise.
The earthquake struck the immediate vicinity of Central Sulawesi, north-east of the capital of Indonesia Jakarte.
On social networks, video clips show a moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a terrorist attack suspect in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Sayfull Saip, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died -- a rare punishment that has not been carried out for federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used a truck to rent a store Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle trail along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, with pedestrians and bikers on his way to October
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed eight victims and "intended" caused a serious physical injury, according to the information about the intention to seek a death penalty, which was endured in the South New York District.
Both points lead to any death penalty, in accordance with the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov's federal grand jury struck a 22-point indictment that included eight murders and extortion charges that federal prosecutors usually use in organised crime cases, and charges for violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and preconceived," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov brought it out as "suffering, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfull Habibulaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariela Erlija, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoze and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca", the report of the intention states.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the New York South District last prosecuted the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was the last execution in the New York federal case in 1953, when couples Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to a conspiracy to espionage the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on 19 June 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of patience in days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he did, the police reported.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching the video of the ISIS on his phone, as stated in the indictment.
He also requested to report an ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police reported.
It turns out he's not guilty of 22 counts of charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal public defenders, said they were "evidently disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, rather than accept confession of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of those events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek a death sentence.
Conservative Member of Parliament says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for negotiations on Brexit
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the national army" during a demonstration at the conservative conference.
Former Head of the Independence Party of the United Kingdom said politicians had to "sigh pressure" Eurosceptics since one of the members of the Theresa May parliament suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone told the rebels in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would so far "be gone" that Mr. Farage was secretary to Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in the reconciliation of their deep-separate lines underlines the deep-separate determination of the Tyrians to join a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan "Checkers" in the midst of the attack by Brexit, the rest of the EU.
The Allies insisted that they continue their efforts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction of the Eurosceptics and the Laborists to choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bone said at a joint campaign "Leave Means Leave" in Solihul that he wanted to "reject the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have received the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were the chief, we'd be out by now," he said.
A member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers."
Referring to its opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to bring our own laws to our country."
Mr. Bone rejected the statement that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed the opinion and that they want to remain completely inaccurate."
The Conservative and Brexitist Andrea Jenkyns were also at the forefront, speaking to journalists: “I just say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
Plan Chequers is not popular in the public, the opposition will not vote for him, is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually those who went out to the streets and chose us.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening."
In a note by Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the gathered that politicians must make themselves "sigh pressure" if they are to fail the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us people and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to issue Brexit and we're here today to tell them that's not going to happen to you."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, on the edge of Brexit’s edition, to feel pressure.
We mobilize the national army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and we will not calm down until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the rest of them marched through Birmingham before they held a two-year assembly in the center of the city.
The majority of activists were blinded by the transparency of "Torians against Brexit" after the launch of this weekend's group.
Laborist Lord Adonis insulted the conservatives for the security problems they suffered with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus plan, for the unmistakable state of the border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "consider seriously" to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would "consider himself seriously to run for the president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that a Democratic woman from Massachusetts was talking about her future on Saturday at a direct association with citizens in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for a rally against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was vice president of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It's been a while in the center of speculation to confront Trump in 2020.
A meeting Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the citizens since Trump took office.
The judge asked her if she was planning to run for the president.
Warren answered that it's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means a woman on the forehead."
Arrest for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she arrested a suspect in a shooting with a fatal result of a basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU) Wade Sims who happened on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police have published information on the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), at 11 a.m., at an ET press conference.
They published a murder video on Friday, looking for help in identifying a man from the footage.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near the campus of the University of Southern.
"Wayde Sims got a bullet wound in his head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, on 247 sports.
Wade got involved to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was investigated and admitted he was in a crime scene and owned a gun and killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police.
Sims, a third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the first 10 positions last season and on average 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps after the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after the order ensures him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since the time that Valteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the team order will "play a major role in the race".
From the initial position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and calling on Vettel to attack his team member.
Vettel first went to the box and left Hamilton on the market at the beginning, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of the wheel driver, which caused the Ferrari driver to leave unfavourably in danger of delay after a double move in defence of the third fault.
Max Verstappen left last row and was the seventh to the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he ran a large part of the race as he trusted his tires to reach a quick finish and ran through the Kimmy Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He finally got into a box in the 44th round, but failed to speed up his pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took the fourth place.
The day was hard because Valteri had been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he's the real gentleman who let me through.
Tim did a really wonderful job to make a formation finish," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad speech of the body.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday for insisting that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she charged the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh with sexual abuse.
Addressing a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly take Ford's testimony to the Senate's Justice Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "bad and bad and dishonest".
"The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and angry, ugly and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publishing and leaking information in the public, they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you drop the information?
Remember her answer... did you leave the document to the public - 'aa, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not.'
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Senators Feinstein was sent in July a letter detailing Ford's instructions against Kavanaugh, and it was released earlier in September - but Feinstein demented that the information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statement, I didn't let her story in public," Feinstein told the board, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her secret, and I kept her secret, which she was looking for."
However, her denial did not come to the approval of the president, who, at the meeting on Saturday night, commented: “Let me tell you something — it was a very bad speech by the body.
Maybe it's not, but I've never seen a worse body speech in my life."
Continuing his defense of candidates for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president suggested that democracy should use these charges for its own purposes.
"They are determined to return the government at any price.
You see the evil, the greed, they don't care who's going to hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president, mediaite conveys.
Elite liga: Dundee Stars 5 中 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars paid off for the defeat of Belfast Giants in Elite League on Friday with a win in Dundee on Saturday with a score of 5 ′′ 3.
The Giants came in early minutes to the advantage of two naked hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the equation, and then Dwyer returned the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard evened for Dundee before the two goals of Lucas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite league season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from the background and won Dundee with the result 2 ′′ 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting of two teams, and the Giants won the previous three games.
The two openings of the game arrived in the fourth minute, more precisely at 3:35, with Kendall McFaull's assistance, with David Rutherford's assistance to double the lead by meeting Beauvillier four minutes later.
In the hasty opening of the game, Sullivan returned the domestic team to the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie's reconciliation at 15:16.
Dwyer took care that the Giants ended the first third with leadership when he gave his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
At home, they were regrouped, and Bouchard once again brought them to a balance in measuring the force naked at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen to lead Dundee at the end of the second third, and he took care of the win when his team had already been on half-way to win the last third game.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, are host boys from Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers in the aircraft escape the earthquake
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died while securing safe flights with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died, and many are being killed as if they were missing after the great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused the tsunamis.
Strong earthquakes continue to strike the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his workplace in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, which was heavily floating.
It was left to ensure safe flight of the Batik Air aircraft on flight number 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going down.
He passed away later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirat, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"Our hearts are broken because of it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of people killed could reach thousands, and the state disaster mitigation agency says that limited access to the cities of Dongali, Sigia and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of dead continues to increase, as many bodies are still under the ruins, and many could not even come," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said.
The waves that reached height and up to six meters broke Paul into which a mass burial would take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "She drove emergency assistance every minute of the body's import.
The government is depleting clean water.
They're stealing small stores all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is pursuing to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Widodo traveled to Pala on Sunday and told the country's army: "Please all of you work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A drop of aircraft in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is being treated as missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
An aircraft company that owns an aircraft that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man is being treated as missing, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members are safely evacuated from the aircraft that was toned.
In his statement, Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon I cannot follow one of the passengers.
The airline reported that they are cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and researchers in trying to find the person concerned.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to requests for additional information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while trying to land at the airport of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials said seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday, and that everyone was in stable condition.
What caused the fall and the precise sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some fathers thought the plane was missing the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to break through the water that cut them to the point of exit in the event of the danger of the aircraft that was toned.
He said the stewards panicked and yelled, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that mariners who worked nearby to repair ports also helped to save by using a boat to breathe people to land before the aircraft sank in about 30 metres of water.
The data from the Air Safety Network indicate that in the accidents of aircraft carriers registered in PNG in the last two decades, 111 people died, but none of them were included in Air Niugini.
An analyst shows a time review of the night the woman is burned alive
The prosecution ended the case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone data to agree to a puzzle on the move of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got location information with a few phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers at night when she was killed, which is contrary to his previous claims, conveys The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at the same location as Chambersin at the time when he was with his friend Michael Sanford, according to his own claims, the police went to investigate Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that that night he was in Sanford's truck, Sanford said he "agreed, because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Mobile data indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, a certain time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, phone calls and contact details.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense should start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting a trial later that day to be sent to the jury.
The High Breed: What's a enlightened hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to challenge a negative attitude toward the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The song group "The High Breed" from Bristol claims that hip-hop music has distanced itself from its beginnings filled with political messages and focusing on social issues.
They want to return to their roots and hip-hop to make again popular.
Artists like Fugees and Commons are born again in Britain through artists such as Akal and Lowkey.
Another black girl?
New York's nanny sues a couple for dismissal after a "racist" message
A New York father sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrong-directed message from a mother who is called "one more black".
Couples deny that they are racists, comparing the charge with "exodus".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out after her first working day in 2016 that she was the new baby of her children, Giselle Maurice, a black woman.
"NOEEE ANOTHER CRNKINE," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her wife.
Instead of sending her to her wife, however, Mrs. Maurice sent her twice.
After she realized her mistake, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a "unwelcome" situation, and she fired Ms. Maurice, because she claims, that their ex-wife, who was an African-American, was doing her job badly, and that instead she was expecting the Philippines, was carrying out a New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got a paycheck for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for a discount fee and looking for a $350 allowance per day for a period of six months for which she was originally hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do such things," said Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple returned to the claim that they were racists, saying that ending Mauritian's employment was reasonable to do, because of the fear that she would not be able to trust her later because of the insult.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her in a message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco for Post.
"Would you trust your children to whom you were rude, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife had only two months of maternity leave after the birth of a child and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You'll sue someone who's in such a situation
"That's not very nice," the investment bank added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned a couple on social networks, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not share with the bears who spoke, is revealed in a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in the letter: “It’s hard to get into the skin of someone who’s going to read the book for the first time.
It's very fun what we know now about Paddington's huge success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC recorder before a little drunk bear inspired him to write a child's book, was optimistic if his work would be rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the book was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death last year.
About Paddington, described as a "very important family member", she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite these men and he wasn't a praiser," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, everything was going to be like someone to achieve their own child: you're proud of him even though none of this is actually your work.
I think Paddington's success was seen that way.
Although it was about his work and his imagination, he always attributed credit exclusively to Paddington."
My daughter died, and we had to forgive ourselves on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Now he has regularly called to say that it is really bad and to believe that it will not come out," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then Nad invited me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I must forgive her.
What I did.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart working slowly lost effect and abandoned her body system.
She died shortly before the landing, and then everything went out.
I just had to sit down and wait knowing what's going to happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything in me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was already in mourning at the time of the loss of her daughter, boarded the aircraft along with the other passengers - who were not aware of the experiences she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and my tears all the time fell down on my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt a strong sense of condolence to Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women’s Messages in Grief on the Bridge to Prevent Suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones for suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting cards on the big bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Ms. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a cook with a contagious smile waiting for a bright career.
"Everyone remembered him by his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
However, before he died, he left his job because he was in "a really dark state".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs Davis said, "I constantly worry that this will have a negative effect."
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea of cards “how people would know there was someone you could go and talk to, even if she was a friend.
Don't sit in silence. You need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs Davies, lost Mark, her partner with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed, or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was on the bottom of Christmas when the kids opened the presents, he didn't look them in the eye or wanted anything else."
She said that his death was a major trauma, but that they had to overcome it: “It all leaves a big hole in the family.
He's leaving us.
But we will continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs about the end while the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought we might be able to enter a little unity if we really managed to get something like what he was looking for," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would break up in the midst of the rooted sideblocks.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their distress was driven by the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections arrive in just five weeks, November 6th, if, as expected, the Republicans do not go well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to bring the wanted man to the election for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush keeps calling Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes his report?
He will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Mike Pence, vice president, to break his decision-making voice and confirm his seat in the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea 'departments' under the leadership of Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea fell after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Calling for the data of the United South Alliance ministry, Park Byeong-seug said last year there were 1127 refugees in comparison with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors are tighter controls on the border crossing between North Korea and China and more taxes that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
The vast majority of refugees from the north eventually gained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China is considered to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns violently.
Relations between the North and the South that are still technically at war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of two countries met in Pyongyang at talks focused on ongoing negotiations on denuclearisation.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense to work on the release of the Korean half-witness of nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, blamed US sanctions for not making any progress ever since.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it does not come to mind that under such circumstances we are the first to disarm," said Mr. Ri, speaking at the UN headquarters in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court
The leader of the protest, Nancy Pelosi, called the judge of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "histories" and said he was unable to serve at the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not but think that if I ever acted like this, a woman would be called "histories," Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally demobilized claims that he was sexually abused by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and squeezing while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee, calling charges against him "gross and coordinated turning" that organised liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the work of the Supreme Court, because he showed that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
On the question of whether he will try to revoke the Kavanaugh if it is confirmed, and if democracy receives most in the House of Representatives, Pelosi has withdrawn.
"I'll tell you next if you don't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then you're not only able to be in the Supreme Court, but not in the court where you are now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democratic, she was concerned about the potential decisions of Kavanaugh against the Act on Access to Care or the law on the expulsion of the proceeds of Roe's proceedings against Wade, since it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored questions about whether he would reinstate some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful'," said Pelosi.
Women have to deal with this.
Reasonable criticism, anger that has been heaping up for months and years, cannot be rid of all of this without pay.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
She continued: “She helped me a lot when she was an executive director who said she was crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started crying, the person who spoke to her said: ‘ Maybe I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great."
The tears are allowed as a way out for anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of the first jobs in the office where men dominated, is how I was, on one occasion when I was crying for unexplained anger, an older woman who was a cold manager who was always a little scared to the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy to think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an external affair on a Monkey Business ship and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running for the president.
"It wasn't a well-designed decision," she told me through a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn't need another one.
Someone called them Snowflake and seven ducks.
Since the campaign was already delayed, she was left behind by fund-raising, and she swore she wouldn't go into the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her passports, which they gave to men for $1,000, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she asked.
While she was saying she was not going to launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions that she was grateful to the people who supported her, by frustration over the system that made it difficult to collect money and to target voters instead of delegates, and by anger over sexism that she had a grip on her throat.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled the media's reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what I'd put on my grave monument.
"She cried."
How trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The start of a trade war between the US and China was loud and, while the battle is far from over, the gap between the countries can be of use to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, has launched the first warning earlier this year, restoring key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation this week occurred with new customs duties affecting products worth $200 billion (150 billion), actually restoring half of all goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing has returned in some way every time, and recently a customs rate of between five and ten percent has been introduced to US$60 billion.
China has promised that the US will respond to the strike, and the other world's largest economy will certainly not be delivered soon.
Washington's retreat could be achieved by failing to demand, but public submission to the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the U.S. trade war pressures can provide positive support to China for a long time by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the launch of economic stroking in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a research associate for strategic thinking that focused on Asia at the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the country that has destroyed a war that lasts more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouale said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas of destroyed terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
Now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were directed towards their daily life and existence have been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries sponsoring the rebellion.

It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy to win the cup again.
I'm happy to help," said Garcia, full of emotion after European victory.
He brings back to his countryman John Ram, who won a legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.

The U.S. team fought all weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, U.S. captain Jim Fury said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At certain times, we have provided resistance to Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna have a fight, I'm gonna work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, so we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your hat on people.
We're uplifted."
