Re-election strategy of the Republican Party against Obama
The Republican leaders have justified their policy of combating electoral fraud.
The Brennan Centre, however, points to such a fraud as myth by the fact that the electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die after a lightning strike.
The Republican lawyers have only recorded 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in the last ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States has responsibility for organizing federal elections by individual states.
And in this spirit, most American governments since 2009 are declaring new laws that complicate the process of election or registration in the electoral list.
This event was followed by a series of elections in November 2010, during which 675 new Republican representatives arrived in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 proposals were submitted only in 2011 to limit electoral law in 41 States.
The new electoral laws require voters to submit an identity card with photographs and documents on American state citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period of pre-election, deprive the right to register on the electoral day of the election, and deprive citizens of the right to register in the criminal register.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no American State requested a photo identification certificate at the polls.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitution of the Indian Law confirmed the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
The Republican authorities have made progress in extending this process to other countries.
In the last two years, the proposals for such laws have been supported in 34 countries with the aim of forcing voters to submit identification certificates with photographs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of the age, will be able to choose, there is no evidence of identity with the photographs issued by the government of their state.
Furthermore, there is no evidence of this identity of about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, the establishment of the required identity list is often more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are unduly affecting young people, minority members and low-income persons.
25% of African Americans, 15% of people under $35,000; 18% of the population aged 65 and 20% of the population aged 18 to 29 years do not have the required identity of the photograph.
And that's not all.
Students who, as voters, know their attachment to democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their identity card with their school photo.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of fishing or fishing clubs who choose more Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs in their elections.
By 2004 no State had requested a citizen’s document in the elections.
The first such request led to Arizona.
Since 2011, about twelve states have adopted laws which impose the obligation of voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes by the Spanish minority.
It should also be noted that two of the three Hispanics favour the democratic side.
The Republican legislators in 2011 supported the eight states of the law that undermines the voter's record on the day of the election.
They also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to volunteers who want to write.
These limitations have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, campaigning for the registration of voters has helped about 10 million people.
The measures adopted after 2009 but led to a decrease in the recording of new votes in 2010 by 17% against 2006.
The Republican legislators then adopted laws aimed at shortening the pre-election period in five other states.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of African-American voters were elected in advance, although only 13% of African-American voters in that state were elected.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They made only 11% of all wishes, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, the whites who represented 76% of all the voters made only 46% of the voters who elected in advance.
Against the approval of laws restricting the registration of voters, of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have been very important.
The democratic governors have blocked a number of legislative proposals by their own.
With a view to delaying the validity of the most controversial laws, the United States Attorney-General has even intervened.
In part, their damage has been limited.
For example, only 16 of the 34 States have adopted laws requiring the identification of photographs.
However, the new rules introduced make the exercise of voting rights quite unmistakably difficult in 2012.
The democratic criticisms speak primarily of the assumptions of the approved laws and consider them to be an obvious effort to influence the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
Brennan's 2011 report shows that the States where these laws were approved represent 171 out of 270 votes in the voter assembly necessary for the victory in the presidential elections.
It is too soon to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain already today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on the election.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: graduate examination or not?
The PSA test resulted in a slight error of negative or even erroneously positive results, leading to other medical advances.
All of this has increased the weight of men who have already tried to go to the exams.
Let's go investigate or not?
We asked for an opinion from two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a high level of contamination among individual tested groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and to make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a difference in mortality between patients undergoing investigation and those who did not.
This study also showed after 12 years of deviation that those who do not want to investigate have a higher risk of metastasis of 30 to 40%.
So I recommend a 50-year-old examination or 40-year-old if your immediate relative had prostate cancer.
The most dangerous group is also African-American-born men.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is discovered.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such species that are incorrect.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the level of risk of its type of cancer, to offer him options, not necessarily to treat prostate cancer that does not affect life in the long term, and to focus in these cases rather on active disease surveillance.
Today, a number of men with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
Let us suggest that they carry out active surveillance and, in the case of disease progress, offer them treatment.
We are increasingly and more precise about the criteria that help in deciding which type of treatment and which one does not.
However, I recommend that the investigation be completed.
However, it is important to complete a doctor’s interview and determine whether an examination is appropriate.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement has created a tool that enables the assessment of and opposition to the PSA investigation.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, the best way to reduce the risk of disease is to adopt the principle of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if all were healthy and moving sufficiently, up to 30% of cancer cases could be avoided.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this data would go up to at least 50%," urges André Beaulieu, a Canadian cancer research spokesperson.
On the contrary, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer's disease causes hereditaryity.
Some percentage remains unexplained as well.
For the Canadian cancer research company, the fight against smoking remains a priority, although the number of smokers is falling.
Cigarettes account for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They're also a risk factor for several others.
It's a real human health problem.
"Today, there are 1.5 million chickens in Quebec," head of speaker André Beaulieu.
Exciting data: 10 years after the chicken stops smoking, the risk of death is reduced to half cancer.
Weight
Body and obstetrics are, according to the SCC, another risk factor for disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat fever and endocrine, jaundice, mucous membranes and diphtheria.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against the cancer of the fat intestine," the report adds.
Experiencing
It also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also appropriate to avoid a marriage for which the same applies.
Preservation of meat by burning, drying or salting may lead to the production of carcinogens.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to cancer development," the report adds.
Vitamins
In recent times, different scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet come to a clear conclusion.
Studies focused on vitamin E are disaggregated according to the SCC.
Although one of them suggests a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another study says that it is more likely to increase.
Nor has the effect of vitamin D on cancer been clearly demonstrated.
Mr. Beaulieu continues to consider how important it is to talk about his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"The investigation doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs's boron examined
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs Bosna caused a legitimate disturbance during the summer.
There is an opinion that this bonnet is divided into a mechanism that is responsible for all mass in the universe.
And then it's the last particle, whose existence predicts the standard model - our best or "at least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of the mass - that has not yet been empirically observed.
However, physics still has no interest in the fact that it is Higgs's boss.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new piece, which is very similar to Higgs's bonnet, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the large physical congress in Kyoto confirm it even more, but still missing all the data so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, let's assume that it's Higgs's bonnet, because the risk of a mistake appears to be small, and let's see how it actually works.
In this world, there is an unquestionable law that says that two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be covered - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it is shown that similar law applies to it: Paul's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot take the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quant state" - this "state" almost creates some of their properties.
It also divides the physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find organized citizens, not farmers who respect Paul’s principle.
And in the second end, the boons move, according to the anarchists who don't care about anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they can be at the same place at the same time.
These beans are further divided into two groups according to the equipment (but absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: the meats that we leave here without notice, and the "force particles", which expands great natural forces and which Higgs is probably associated with somehow.
It must be said, however, that these beans are not as exotic as they might be thought.
If you read this article, it's because of a box with unusual banality: photon, or "parts of light", which is "inhabited" by electromagnetic forces.
So if the particles with the electric charge accelerate or change their direction, they'll "remove" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like the shell of the fisher.
From this "removal" the electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photomechanical wave - and thus one of the borons, "power bearers".
More stable fields
It's also with the Higgs Boone, only with the difference that "break" is necessary another field, Higgs's field to show up.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; its excitement is to achieve very high energy values, like in frozen fish, which is already only a very large balance.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator of the part as a accelerator in the laboratory CERN - a large Hadron accelerator with interlocking wires is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to be able to develop such energy.
Analogs with the electromagnetic field are once again appropriate to explain the relationship between Higgs and the mass.
The electromagnetic field does not react to all particles or all materials.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others don't -- the piece of paper, for example, will never hold on to itself.
And the same is true that the Higgs field does not respond to all the particles: those who do so have a certain amount of mass, while the others (such as photos, let's look at it) do not have it.
And Mrs. Novakov asks what all these research is, what will be brought to us?
From the point of view of science, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which enables physicists to examine any disagreement between the observation and the predictions of the SM.
In addition, the physics problem literally wants to find them, because the smaller difference could open the space of "new physics" and seal some gaps in the model.
It is necessary to note that the model has a huge deficit so far, does not provide any explanation of gravity (ouha!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the universe's mass (beyond ouha!).
However, CERN has not been able to detect such conflicts so far.
Responses
The answers to these studies in your daily life can only be very difficult, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be no one.
Look, at the very beginning of the 1960s, they didn't have laser propellers in Bell's labs or any idea of the revolution they've been calling for.
They predicted scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was discovered in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (formerly the paprsky were pulsed) in 1962, I already said that - the laser was initially considered such a "laboratory game".
Just imagine...
In addition, the application may also come out of any tools that surround the research.
For example, Willard Boyle created a small light recorder in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This recorder, although Boyle didn't plan it at first, now serves as the eye of all the digital cameras in the world and gave him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that activities around LHC have to change our lives, but that means that people never really know...
Palitative Care - The best way to get out of life...
With the help of its Commission for the Honorable Death, Quebec recently addressed the issue of the end of life.
The debate should continue at once and the bill is in the process.
There is still much work to be done in this key area.
Le Devoir’s magazine tried to look at this question in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterégie.
The cancer of the prostate that fed her gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life and it's already seven," she says without emotion in her bed in the house for the palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he says.
Immorality has done its work: Immortal weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or just eat himself.
He looks at the deliciously looking breakfast and agrees that we can help him eat.
He's brave and even laughs, talking to strangers who stop with him, bringing him drugs, offering a bath.
Absorbing to ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of that passage, it humiliates me," she confesses.
A few hours later, he found a team of doctors on his drug problem.
"In the whole life, a person learns that men are wetting in the womb," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the stage of the child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"depends on the ability of the person to accept the return, the psychologist claims.
According to the opinion of a number of people dealing with palliative care, the key moments are played in the very core of such a return.
Patients who go to home with Victor-Gadbois palliative care are suffering from cancer.
Their forecasts are up to three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and sisters who care for them do not provide so-called "medical" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, it's the worst fear of dying "to breathe in full consciousness".
But my weakness made it possible for me to reveal my children.
"I have good kids," she says.
"I no longer have any wishes in my life," he says, and then he lets us put her in a breathing device.
Still looking forward to the last visit of the son of Italy in the following days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, care is provided for the body with food.
So it looks like a palliative care that's happening if you can't do anything else.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québec, one bed is a palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little if we realize that we all die once.
Here life continues under optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, the taste of brandy or pepsi can be given.
Diabetes don't have to control their sugar level anymore.
And death here is part of everyday life.
They brought Mr. X.'s beer last night, which he died at night.
He's drinking his son's beer this morning for his father's honor.
"We help patients as close as they are," says Nathalie Savard, director of the care services.
In Victor-Gadbois's house, days go by, but they don't like each other.
In addition to a 30-year-old man who is delighted with his last meeting with his family well placed on the pillows, while being added to his honor, he dies tragically 16-year-old man surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after he has tried every opportunity to survive.
"For half a year, there are always three to five beds, which are designed for people with cancer for up to 45 years," Dr. Christiane Martel says with concern.
53% of patients coming to Victor-Gadbois' house, coming from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, care intended to alleviate suffering as soon as the patient reaches the final stage of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And a number of organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois and the Home palliative treatment company in the Grand Montreal area, specialize more specifically in the care provided to oncology patients.
And this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec leads to the fact that a number of doctors specializing in palliative care are concerned with the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, it has been in the course of manifest signatures in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they argue that they disagree with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that all persons have access to quality palliative care before they can agree with euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in emergency in severe pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to get her out.
It is feared that patients will not be asked to die for the reason that they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, a number of oncologists have been caring for their patients for up to the last few moments, regardless of the adverse forecast.
The hopes for the survival of Hélène Richard were already very minimal when she left her pregnancy chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to end my treatment, she answered that she was sorry that I stopped fighting, and she told us.
And then she told me it was over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel's estimate that 90% of the patients who want to die are grateful to their treating doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when the palliative monkeys soothed their pain.
It must be said, however, that palliative care is certainly not all - powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, the director of the Grand Montreal Pavilarial Care Community, patients are protected from pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use a palliative sedative, which the patient will sleep until the fall, whether it is contagious or if it is permanently administered.
We can't face the fact that we don't experience this part of suffering.
A patient we don't get pain free will have an ever-increasing possibility of access to palliative sedatives.
The powerless without sedatives, they always say the same thing, "I want to die."
But it doesn't always have to mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," it means "I want you to get rid of my pain."
The implementation of this report made it possible for journalists to receive a grant from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive reality scandals in Quebec
Travel officials, construction business and public works, political lobbyists and Italian mafia experts are still telling what they know about the amazing "system", where construction, public officials, politicians, experts and mafia are involved.
This "sector" has come to Quebec's taxpayers very expensive especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has broken down since we took the basic measures," says ironically Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebecer and former police chief in Montreal.
In 2011, he launched a scandal on the basis of a subsequent investigation of the financing of the construction contracts in Quebec, which was approved by the then liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest after long delays.
Duchesneau's report confirmed a direct link between industry, transparent financing of the parties and corruption of state officials.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "only the Ministry of Transport has saved billions of dollars' contracts," when some people held on to their instincts to gain a share in them!
Charbonneau's commission "which led to the demise of two elders," he adds with the hope that it will be able to "discover the instincts of some people".
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The permanent unit for the fight against corruption established in 2011 is also involved in the fight against its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
To this end, police officers "Marteau's family", who have since 2009, ensured that the visual "money card" significantly mitigates the inflaming of orders...
In recent weeks, a number of surveys have been conducted and have been accused of fraud and corruption of a number of general representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, a mayor of one of the localities.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
It is suspected that he has repeatedly accepted fees in exchange for public contracts.
Formal accusations have already been received by transport engineers from Montreal and Italian-born entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurs and Lino Zabbito.
Lino Zambito called for a sensation when the committee explained the "system" mechanism for obtaining public orders.
During these years, he devoted 3% of the value of the orders he received in Montreal to the mob, who then transferred the money to the Union of Montreal, who was running for the mayor of Gérald Tremblay.
After 2000, Zambito was generous to all parties and dedicated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about EUR 68,000) to provincial parties, particularly to the liberals who were then in power.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal financial assessment for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money-in-laws that were subject to price
In Montreal, the "system" corruption worked very well.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described it very carefully before the Commission: during ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to excursions, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and a total of $736 000 in exchange for cash purchases at which he had a higher price.
Other public actors in the transport sector admitted that they let themselves be paid for by 30% to 40% overestimating invoices through false multiple work.
The mayor's organizer, Martin Dumont, later accused Tremblaye of turning his eyes on the current budget, which brought dirty money into his treasury.
On the basis of these findings, Tremblay withdrew at the beginning of November, setting Montreal to a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first to issue a warning signal.
As the mayor of the Rivière-des-Piries district in the east of the island, it has been working against the sale of the general land purchased for 5 million dollars and sold for... 1.6 million promoters directly in the middle of the growing real estate trade.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says that "it takes a thread to understand the functioning of the promoted antagonist system to stop gangrene and catch the guilty".
According to her, the process is "sick, but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but it is necessary to set up a separate investigation unit in Montreal and ensure that these questionable practices cannot be returned.
It's like she's cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public actors have cut hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "informed employees" if they have not been involved in these tricks!
It estimates that 70% of the funding of election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, and with irony it adds: "I hear it's just a weak defense of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit gifts to $100, but according to it, the situation does not resolve: "Unless election expenditure is strictly limited, dirty money from politics will not disappear."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We can no longer be reduced; if we focus on the substance of the matter, we can rebuild on a stronger basis and with greater control and compliance with the laws."
If this story was painted by Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who smiles at him to look at their own castle...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you and the PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by all individuals going to themselves, or by the new size of the PSG.
The big players came to us.
I get next to them every day.
The technical team helped me a lot too.
Every day, these realities allow me to increase the level of games.
And it's easier when it comes to games.
It's all going so fast in football.
I'm not losing my mind.
From my beginnings in the preparation of the INF Clairefontaine until after I moved to Saint-Etienne, I've always considered a single stage.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti introduced...
The poses of this year are common to play games at a very high level.
They also know that every training course is essential.
And it turns out that a player like me then has a greater taste for winning and wants to give maximum performance.
And besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my position.
He's got assistants like Claude Makele, who played in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all the techniques.
Today, he is not equal in the 1st league and is among the best European coaches.
He has tremendous experience and has won a lot of titles with the peak teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he wins other titles in Paris.
In January, I graduated from a soothing conversation with him.
I've had a lot of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st class, Lyon took our lead.
But we're still in jail.
One of our main goals is the League of Masters: we have very easily moved to the eighth level.
What's your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for the quality of European teams.
We want to win our team first in front of Port, so we can play in the eight-final drive home.
Can the PSG stand in a short-term horizon with a large European club?
I've got a budget on it.
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and write down history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial side, the PSG has the means to achieve this objective.
And would it be a great failure to win in the first league as in the last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We've been missing enough in the last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We picked 79 points.
It usually pays off that with 79 points you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.
I think it's gonna happen this year.
Even though they're trying on the title of big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have weapons available to beat them.
Do you think the PSG media are expecting too much?
It's not unusual for us to expect a lot from what we've invested in here and what players we have.
That's what we're accepting.
It's true that if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home and there's still something they're counting on us in the papers, it's not really nice.
A man asks what more people can want from you.
Of course, he can't win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Masters' League, we proved that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, which hasn't been going to the Osmiffinal since the second season, and they've also invested large amounts!
Given the amounts invested, it would be expected that you will have 15 points in front of the other!
You're insulting the other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille Clubs, which did not do too much last season, moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
It shows how amazing the 1st league is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that despite all our difficulties, we have been able to win.
It seems like the PSG in everything depends on the performance of the Golden Ibrahimic.
It's a good thing it's said there's "dependence on the Golden."
This means that Ibrahim is very effective and gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here to prove he's the 1st star.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
In our team, we respect people and players.
And he respects the people he has around him.
What he's achieved is truly exceptional.
This also led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also makes it possible for others to grow by themselves.
How did you live Euro 2012 with French representation?
As a disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play the way I imagined.
But I experienced it, and I got out stronger.
Today I'm also able to play good games in the performance.
And I've been hoping for it since I got to represent it.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to make our appearance exemplary.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps in the head of the national team?
He's talking about the results.
We're in a good place at MS.
The coach picks hard, is close to the players and is able to overpower for the win.
That's the way Laurent Blanc was.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc has achieved his goal by qualifying for the euro.
I hope Didier Deshamps will bring our team to Brazil.
Is the remix (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid-born match?
This game has given us self-concealed.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I didn't win such a game for my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without a bank
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and cost of processing between recipients.
As these technologies are also often true, there is a clear political perspective: the conviction that the current financial system based on banking monopolies leads to a financial crisis.
Bitcoin, the inventor of which is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (but affordable for dollars, euro...), a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between two partners.
Thanks to the 15,000 computers involved in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
Approximately a thousand websites are already receiving bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin first reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to $2, today it moves at the border of about ten dollars (the price overview is listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on the virtual finances that emerged in October.
Bitcoin refers to "the most successful virtual money", "competition of dollars and euros" and "the period of regular money".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money by using it as "credit" used for the video game process, which one gets a game or which he can buy (and then switch back).
The social network of Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Every month, however, the central authority controls and processes individual communication.
In the case of Bitcoin, all net depositors of ordinary accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers and sellers are all taken.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user can choose another address for any payment that provides anonymity.
The information file relating to this transaction is electronically signed by the two-key encryption system.
The network can verify the validity of the transaction.
It is also possible to ensure that replaced bitcoins exist in the public book of regular accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is in the record of this new transaction in this book.
It shall be carried out through the resolution of the mathematical task assigned to computers whose solution, such as a temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional order.
This is a phase of file splitting; i.e. the transformation of the huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, then the whole "cut off".
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (very zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check its correctness.
The transaction will then inevitably be shown linked to the chain of all other transactions; any adjustment would be made to the print change.
If the user wants to pay twice the same money very quickly for the purpose of fraud (up to ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the second will be left because each of them has a different print.
A computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this remuneration is divided regularly by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, but it can be divided up to a hundred million, so the area for the margin is here...
The burden of the task is also increased by an increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its rise and fall.
The sites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and there has been a removal of stored bitcoins.
"The used stove is not the only protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem pays for cash.
Important players like Wikipedia deny the gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dori Ron of the Weizman Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of regular accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not occur.
In November, there were "great reductions".
"There was an exchange of thirty thousand dollars," is pleased Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who is involved in the conversion of bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is an equivalent credit card (with real money) or a wireless payment mobile, but uses Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the carrier manages its identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily configured for traders where new terminals or software need not be installed.
Just tell the address that can be "photographed and recognized" on the phone, explains Pierre Noizat, which ensures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement towards questioning hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin occurs, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive," she predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB proposes to reassess the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this kind of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
The French units left their responsibility area in Afghanistan (Capis and Surobi).
NATO and US units should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of their territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect all of us.
The greatest harm has been suffered by people in the Afghan countryside, which we suffered because we considered them terrorists.
And we, too, are about 88 soldiers killed, and all these injuries and freezes.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leading representatives who fled to Pakistan, but often it is rurals who refuse the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They only want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though the jihadites, the Pakistanis, the Arabs, the Uzbek, the Tajiks have joined them.
They now enjoy tolerances and often help local rebels, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decrease.
The departure of the French units from the base of Nijrab, which I was following from the top girls of the mountain mandlons because of the French loans, took place in an orderly manner.
The convoys of trucks and parked vehicles arrived in Kabul without an attack on the air traffic of the helicopter.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be active in Kabul.
The conditions have changed significantly between 1994 and 1996 from their unstoppable procedure.
The Kabul was once empty, and the earth was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between various fighting groups.
Their takeover over the country was then considered to be a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the vastness of these peasants, who were completely controlled by Al-Ká'ida, but their situation did not improve until our time.
Some Mujahedinas, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main values of the war against Soviet units returned to power in 2001.
They became leaders, strengthened state lands that sold as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge American orders for subcontractors.
And they denied; most of them were not at all in the battle.
According to what I heard in the campaigns, people are looking for a government that will not make thieves.
A number of young people want to leave like those who have been able to use American generosity: the loss of capital is significant.
Young people are already making war and ideologies associated with it.
During the liberation in Iran or Pakistan, the modern world was known and its benefits were invigorated.
About 65% of the population are 25 years of age; in Kabul, there are currently 5 million inhabitants, five of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full, girls and boys are going there.
These young people will have to provide work, which they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former, or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including armed opposition, likes mobile phones; television and Turkish series that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities standing in her forehead be considered legitimate?
Some of the commanders of the battle against the Soviet army are already renewing provincial militias that will be beyond the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence on local identity, should enjoy certain decentralisation measures in the form of Western states, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised state with a strong presidential influence, so it came to the abolition of the Prime Minister's position, which existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzaí does not want foreign controls, especially in the case of elections scheduled for April 2014.
His country, however, has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 50th and earlier years.
No industry has been able to restore itself, no fence is working, no primary cooling system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is made, except fruit and vegetables.
Advantage has a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
It was reported that Afghanistan has enormous unceasing wealth.
And it just felt like the Western states were here just to make it stronger.
Without energy to process iron or copper on the spot and without means to transport raw materials over the mountains, but no demand for non-growth can be made.
The Chinese have almost left their mark on Mes Aynak and left the international archaeological teams (for the support of the World Bank) to explore the vast Buddhist area in order to preserve the role of the most important employer in the entire province.
One day it will also be necessary to restore normal relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depends on a large proportion of imports and exports.
The departure of the French military units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of the common types of assistance: girls and boys, French universities, French institutions, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural areas, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative "to acquire the heart and soul" has been a challenge to reconcile aid and military activities, in which the service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) has been active, which was abolished in 2012, but has been achieved by a number of French non-governmental organisations in the area of common interest and agricultural reconstruction in dozens of mountain villages.
These works involving the number of local workers helped to prevent the rise: the freezing, cold, drinking water, deforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of the processing area.
What kind of memory do we have after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very demanding in these remote areas, which are often located at an altitude of over 2,000 m.
The Government received dozens of written requests for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapis.
In order to free these farmers from the rise of foreign-led groups, they wish, according to their words, to achieve undue civil aid in their favour, which would have been properly controlled and directly affected.
Hard work on the Egyptian constitution
President Muhammad Mursí left for another part of the poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the declaration of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to play the vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, without regard to the opinion of all the others, that the Constitutional Assembly would approve the final text tomorrow.
A few weeks ago, the head of the State assigned this meeting two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using the provisional text, which has been supplemented many times, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal arguments.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's fragmentation.
In the view of the opposition, the President breaks down in his "autocrat deal", continues to "breaks his word" and "suffers the right".
His supporters, however, assure us that it is a means to tackle the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
In two weeks, a referendum should be held.
It is a very short period of time, which will make the Brotherhood withdraw from the Egyptian text to explain the article after the article.
It is also a way for the President to regain national and democratic legitimacy while the protests are being rejected throughout the country.
As he confirmed in his talk for the American Week of Time, Muhammad Mursí seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it.
Especially because this fast-organised vote puts the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "Whether you approve my text or I leave unlimited powers," which should otherwise end after the new constitution has been approved.
And in this special air yesterday, 85 Members of the said constitutional assembly with a large majority of Islamists approved the text.
Most liberals were missing during the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitution was declared, they knocked at the door by not having an opportunity to express their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society, or members of religious minorities have taken their steps.
In order to achieve the capacity, 11 of the alternates were quickly added last morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brotherhood.
It will not surprise then that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators further argued that one of the many disputes that day was about... hours for prayer when some members of the committee held the view that the hours in the sitting room were not properly managed.
The text, which was voted last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, is finally consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that "the principles of the right of the Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoped that they would replace the term "principles" with the term "justice", which would allow for more stringent application.
For the Islamics, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their good will and respect for other parts of the Egyptian society.
"Traffickness," they reject liberals who see only a verbal problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which confers upon the University of Al-Azhar the advisory role, in particular on questions of monitoring compliance with the law of the Sharia.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "persons who are invited to express themselves are not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of theocracy."
The supply of liberals is even more exhilarating the fact that the future Rector of the University should be less moderated than the current one.
"In the meantime, there has been no specific religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not involuntarily, but university workers have studied in French schools," Alexis Blouet, who prepares work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, they agree that "there may be disagreements about the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used therein are part of a religious dictionary.
There is a reference here to "fiqh" [Islamic law science, late red.].
And in the future, there can be a question of the extent to which civil judges are competent to express themselves."
Yesterday, the text approved is highly criticised in addition to the religious pages because of the extended powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brotherhood insists that there has been a significant restriction against the former regime.
Another controversial place: the powers of the armed forces.
In accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the army, the defence budget will not be audited by Parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
They will not then be prohibited in military courts with civilians, as required by the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.
This association speaks about its doubts in relation to the text which they consider to be against freedom.
The torture is retained and the offence is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article deals with women's protection, stresses Heb Morayef from the Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only point of view is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the preceding article.
While the Egyptian President had a TV show last night, events are scheduled to take place this afternoon.
The state's leaders will manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the world's poppies and the sea from a saturated solution of salt
The land promised in itself combines the size of Bible truth, modern comfort, and insecurity of nature.
The company AaF identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Giving With Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God’s mercy will come upon all who enter into this “false one. ”
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: changes of water in the wine at the wedding, walking after the water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after his resurrection.
But most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here are going through the path of pain or the way of Jesus Christ (Latin Via Dolorosa).
Starting at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the court was held, he walks through the streets of the Old City and leads to the Temple of God's tomb on Mount Golgotha - to a place of intersection, to a stone of anointing and a place where Jesus was buried.
There is a symbolic Christian dome of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the temple of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree was planted from which the cross was made to Jesus ’ cross.
There is also the most sacred place in Jerusalem for the Jews - The Wall of the reeds, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different backgrounds here leave records with wishes that will then be fulfilled.
Entrepreneurship Vertical Path
The fact of Masada’s fortress remained secret in front of the enemy, who Herod the Great set up in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The area is located on the shores of the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who deal with horocescities can have their own strengths.
The others on this historic mountain will take out the chain.
And in the north of the country there is a well-known ski resort Hermon, which is experiencing a huge wave of tourists in the winter months.
To this ski paradise, tourists are transported from the hill's shore of the quay bus.
The total length of mountain settlements is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, they were supposedly living on the top of the mountain of worship of the gods.
Visit the Unique Museum
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You won't be able to visit everyone during one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (parliamentum).
It contains ancient Qumran manuscripts or Dead Sea scrolls found in the caves of the Jewish wilderness, and some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Arts is also attended in Tel-Aviv.
In his exhibition, his salary is widely represented by impressionists and expressionsists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish spas with pictures of users of spas and spas from that time.
In Caesar, there is a unique private museum Ralli where you can admire the tastes of Dale and Roden.
There's no guide here, no funerals with souvenirs.
The entrance is free and gifts are strictly refused.
The fifth museum - the museum of the holocaust or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built on the memory of 1.5 million children who were killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You will enter - and you will feel in absolute darkness.
The stars are shaking.
And they bear the names of the children of Judah, and the names of the lands in which they died.
Ukraine is also being introduced.
Improve Your Health
Three of Israel’s main spa resorts are located on the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphins and oceans.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea it can also be bought in the winter months, because the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people are buying in it all year round.
The Dead Sea is, by the way, the most peculiar sea in the world, located at the lowest anchor point of the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
Azur water is a saturated salt solution, which easily keeps on the cold and the people who can't swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealisticly beautiful.
Get out here to undergo treatment with salty water - saline, and a medical bath that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergy, asthma, eczema, arthritis, pertussis, diabetes to cure your affected nerves.
Touching the Hidden Past
Protecting the old part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Over them, the famous sea route connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The mention of this city is in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is the place where Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved a beautiful Andromeda, with which they lived together a long and happy life.
In fact, tourists love tolls with school streets named after the famous zoo.
It's said that if you press on the walls in the street of your "your" sign, happiness will be a favor to you.
In Jaffa, you may meet the newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and "get" the strength of the crusades.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the home of Roman prosecutors, including Pilate Pontus.
The carefully reconstructed theater is used today for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, by word of mouth
If you're going to Israel, you don't have to worry about your incomplete English language: in this country, about 30% of the Russian population speaks.
On the road it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for cheques (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 shekels).
The city transport is especially bus, but in Jerusalem it rides a speed tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations connecting the lower city to the upper.
It's basically a subway route.
Traveling all types of public transport is 6 checks for which you can drive 1.5 hours by moving.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, it stops working on markets, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning starts a work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get a basket of food: except for fresh meat, seafood, fish without mushrooms and food containing a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a wide selection of food from lamb and beef, fruits and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish cheese hummus, different types of sauces, cakes from milk cheese - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no fat dogs on the streets of the Israeli cities.
That's why there's a lot of hungry cats here that are gracefully "tossed according to their taste."
In the evening hours you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The passing cats love the stalwart places and they will gladly let themselves into every goodness.
The car loan will be made from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 per day (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And loaning the bike will be about 15 shekels a day.
The entrances to the museum are 30 shekels on average.
Indicated numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
To know the country and to rest came most of the citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The country's promised visit from January to October 2012 to 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the abolition of the visa on 9 February 2011.
"Great and powerful" will announce it to Moscow: Emigrants will save their money in the language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language tests, there have already been frauds in the country who are selling "favoured" certificates
Moscow, Petrohrad and other Russian cities come to 13 million foreign workers every year.
Most of them are Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law entered into force, under which each migrant worker will be required to test the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, FMS promises that appropriate tests will be required for all visitors in time.
However, tests will not only consist of language knowledge, but also of Russian history and the fundamentals of law.
The knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Tomuto law is not subject to any people who have successfully succeeded in obtaining a certificate and obtaining an academic degree in the fall of the USSR in 1991.
The benefit, judgment and protection of rights
The network of testing sites will work under the protection of Puskinov of the Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship among Nations, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian schools.
Migrants can run tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing has also been supported by the representatives of the State and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders have been able to put a lot of pressure on the press: and what will it really bring?
What changes will the obligation to know Russian and visitors themselves?
In particular, the migration service representatives are responsible for reducing the number of people suffering as a result of "secondary work."
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains the chairman of the FMS Russia delegation in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebellev.
The protection of their rights should be started before they leave.
The only system of organised recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in immigrants without a call, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - says Sebellev - the future migrant is sentenced to shooting with dishonest people, who, under threat of aid, provide him with a "command" to dangerous, narrow dwellings in which he and dozens of others, like himself, will spend the whole month without food and documents and spend 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their authorities they promise one thing, but after arrival they are deceived, entertain their passports, do not pay the promised wages," confirms MS Tolib Sharipov's Head of Tajik Labour Migration Management.
Don't move!
The less many Central Asian citizens who intend to work in Russia admit that they do not know the language of the country they want to get, but do not have experience even with the work they do.
Of course, it is not their fault, as much as luckier: only a very few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tadzik can afford at least a reasonable basic education.
For their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be dressed properly, dressed, and dressed in school.
As children grow up to productive age, they have to work for the first time.
Without the knowledge of the language, it's hard to admit.
"You feel humiliated and undermining."
It is true that in view of the law on language tests, human rights defenders point to one important issue.
Testing will only take place with those migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't do any tests, they won't get any more official work.
In the meantime, most migrant workers live the same way as before in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or uninvited entry prohibited"
Many of the incoming workers claim that getting official status in our country is not easy at all.
Reasons - bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
Legalization is also worth the money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we basically have false documents, without registration, and therefore gas leaks.
"They demand a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," he shared his experience with the public of Tajikistan, Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be hungry, buy a painting."
On the first day of validity of the language law, it was found that false is not only the documents of migrants on registration.
FMS employees have already had a number of false certificates on language exams.
The burnt documents are printed on the ordinary colour printer.
Of course, the new owners were not free: each of the migrants was hoping that the easy problem with the completion of the tests would be paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times the amount above the formal test: it will become a migrant worker of three thousand rubles.
The main task of the nearest future is to ensure a system against corruption so that workers can not buy documents easily, which is agreed by government officials and human rights defenders.
Government authorities have so far been able to promise foreign workers who did not pass the tests first, the time needed to complete the course of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not have Russians are expected to work in areas where there is no need for active dealings with people.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not engage in the illicit arms market
The proportion of crimes using legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia is proposing to strengthen the law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
This is the response of government authorities to recent events: there was an emphasis on shooting cases at the weddings that were held without a victim, and the massacre prepared by Moscow lawyer Dimitry Vinograd, which resulted in the death of seven people.
Police want to prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which you can obtain a license to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years of age.
This opinion is supported by the head of the Committee of the Dumb for Security and Combating Corruption of Irina Jarovaj, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be submitted to the State Dumb in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to solve the problem of the path of "screwing screws".
An open letter appeared on the network, whose authors - representatives of various social gun organizations - demand the rejection of the "unreasonable suppression" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, Vasilij Lesnikov, a lawyer and a criminal in the conversation with the Russian editor of the BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 crimes were committed in the six-month period of 2012, using the armed weapons of the registered authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the strengthening of the legislation in the field of civil weapons does not accept the offender to move to the "black" market.
According to their words, it is currently possible to find a low-cost weapon in Moscow.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races by officers
"Black" arms market is stocked with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baranéc, who worked for ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages that accept arms orders
The first of them is the "armed or military road", which means a weapon that was cut off during the fights in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were also stolen by the Russian officers and the convicts themselves," Baranec says.
Other types of "black weapons" are weapons stolen criminals from security forces.
Baranec explains that there are also thefts from police stocks and weapons stolen directly from employees of criminal authorities.
The illegal "mainly" is available for sale from military funds.
In many military funds, explosions often occur.
"It's proven that some fires have been set up deliberately - to cover the gap like this," said the former soldier.
According to the words of Barance and the arms manufacturer, they make their contribution.
"At present, private arms companies that are not competitive on the international market are emerging, and they are cutting off weapons that are supplying to the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
Another source of the black market is feeding.
Especially a large number of guns and machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's their production there, sometimes weapons are produced here in painting, and there's a mafia that organized their gas production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons on the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Specialists have broken down the statements of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, the criminal literature and public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers report, come from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons were placed on the black market "with the guilt of official agents whose work is linked to weapons," the report says.
According to the data available to the researchers, 17% of the weapons of armed conflict are involved, in 14% of cases, there was a theft of weapons in their production, 5% being "black archaeology".
The salesman-consultant of one of the arms trades, who has asked us not to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations of black "archeology" have long been purchased - they're just too old.
Most often, as it says, salesmen drive for new shipments directly into military stocks.
Through the solicitor, the interested person buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
You order a gun to him and he sells it to you through the plate.
"He will take it to the city and sell it there for 900 euros per piece with two containers," he explains.
"The truth is that the police are good in the image, and therefore, whenever they start to burn a plan in the explanation of criminal acts, they will run a control purchase with illegal arms dealers," the consultant adds.
"As in a luxury store."
The sellers with the buyer most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy who offered me an opportunity to cross the "Example" platform where a man who would lead me to a "cout" where we would act together.
Primarily, I found out when I was there.
Military rapporteur Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need a known guy who knows the way out, tell the salesperson. - I have a known one, but I don't fully trust him.
The sellers on the market are, but there's also to go, hypothetically "from Mr Ivan Ivanovice, who asked me to arrange for my daughter to get out of her teeth."
And now I'm going to get over the man I'm sure of.
He also gives it to me because he knows I'm not giving it to him.
Initiators are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranéc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was working on a publication on this topic.
The schematics did not change according to his words.
They gave him a photo album where it was "everything you thought."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," remembers the soldier.
The buyer, according to the words of Baranèce, does not offer a walk in the bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy it - we're going with the wood salesman and we're going to build a field.
"They give me the chance to shoot, and when I'm convinced that the gun is shooting well, we're starting to act," says the knower's procedure.
AC Adapter
Searchers will bring you online to the "Vkontaktu" website and groups where you can buy weapons "for different purposes".
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a fixed amount of money," they write in the commercial title on the website "Buying a gun or a machine."
On these pages, users leave their notices and ask questions.
And sell the unfavourable?
"Of course, without a license," the user asks Ivan (the law is preserved).
"I'm buying TT.Mossqua" - it's briefly formulating the "Fedorenkov" requirement.
The Federal Security Service recently decided on a huge network of web sites and people who want to buy military weapons can bury them with a shovel.
People eat like hungry fish on the habit and then get carbon on Siberia.
Military rapporteur and senior military judge Viktor Baraněc
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will pay over the ATM.
"In response to this, the salesperson will send a photo and a description of the directions where the weapon is hidden," the press spokesman of the NGO "Right to the gun" Dmitrij Kislov explains.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can remain free of weapons and bet on the net.
The Federal Security Service recently decided on a huge network of web sites and people who want to buy military weapons can bury them with a shovel.
"People eat like hungry fish on the habit and then get carbon on Siberia," he confirms.
Macarov for $100
When you buy illegal weapons, you will usually pay the amount from $100 to $900 according to experts' estimate.
According to Dmitrí Kislov from the NGO "Right to Arms", you will arrange the Makarov gun for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month to one and a half months.
The weapon shall be dispatched from the stockpiles for long-term storage through the medium-term stockpiles.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% compared to the period of January 2011 and was 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of reported cases of theft and extermination of weapons, firearms, explosions and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, staff from fast food and supermarkets arrive
Work on a cash-operated "McDonald" takes up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In the last few days in America, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in the high-markets of Walmart and in restaurants of popular high-speed chains such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Vendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will be turned into a nine - wave wave, or whether it will be executed soon.
All these actions are supported by committees and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to the increase in the minimum wage paid by a number of workers in Walmart and in fast-paced systems, the aim of protest organisers is to achieve their creation in their committee organisations.
At present, this economic sector is practically unaffected by the Committee's sensitivities.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "black Friday", when a cheap sale orgy hit America, captured millions of people and in some cases was accompanied by fighters.
On this day, some Walmart employees, in which 2.2 million people worldwide work, left their workplace and demonstrated together with the committees and leftover activists of the international trade chains companies, whose goods are destined for people from lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from prey through hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its sales are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why a lot of low-wage employees in Walmart's stores are buying only themselves at work.
Availability and range of goods made from the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart may allow itself to sell goods so cheaply because he only pays little of his employees.
They also complain about bad working conditions, such as lack of automatic vehicles or manual scanners.
The "black Friday" demonstrators demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the health insurance costs of the companies provided increased rapidly from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee gets $9.5 an hour, but it doesn't match the amount of expenditure, employees say.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage of $12 per hour, it will be $3.2 billion a year.
It is an average of 1.1% more than this company is paying now.
If Walmart moves an increase in the wages of the consumer, each visit to the sale will be only 46 cents more.
In a year like this, customers lose about $12,39 more than they do today.
Walmart’s supporters point out that the protest was carried out in only nine countries and that the company should not cause any damage.
"Black Friday" in the company's sales lasted from 8 hours night on Thursday to midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items of goods per second.
In total, her savings were made on "black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The representative of Dan Fogelman stated in the interview for the left-wing Huffington Post website that the jobs left "less than five" employees of Walmart, and that the protest was all "more media sensation" organized by the committees.
"Unencumbered treasure!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart's business houses (they are not too in shape in that advanced city, and therefore they are not almost here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he's selling billions of pores, and then he's not paying you any sickly and he's not paying you for your decent work!
Jumaane Williams, City Council member in New York
At present, the minimum wage is paid for work in accordance with federal laws and the New York State rules of $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this loan, but only slightly, and on average they receive their rowing workers in New York at $8.90 an hour.
No one in this precious city has a lower wage.
I don't understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
The "McDonald" job takes place almost a quarter of American teenagers who work after school for part-time and live with their parents.
Only a few people see their main source of food or plan to stay there for a long time.
At present, I keep meeting with McDonald's employees, who complain they have to live with these money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other side of the Wall Street Journal forum hangs a comment, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
Participants of the protests that started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonald" on 40th Street and at Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and chefs start to get at least 15 dollars an hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of a committee organisation in the area of rapid purification.
American laws prohibit the administration from banning the establishment of trade union organisations and the treatment of the activists of the trade union movement by harassment and release.
On the other hand, their management is only rarely affluence to life.
However, it is also difficult to establish in the fast-changing industry of the Committee's organisation for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation of employees.
Incompatibilities
This day there were loud protests also in a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The execution of this action was in the afternoon meeting at "McDonald" near Times Square, where a number of local democratic policies emerged, especially a member of the Jumaane Williams City Council, who said, "McDonald" says he sells billions of pores, and then doesn't pay you sick and does not pay you properly for your honorable work!"
The demonstrators also expected the support of other prominent New York democracies, such as the old town candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we need to work together to support fast food workers in order to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity, as every non-virgin deserves!"
As the New York Times said, it was the greatest act of its kind in the history of the American sphere of rapid fertilization.
But there were only a few hundred people involved in it, although not all of them were employees of the fast milling that tens of thousands of people are employed in New York.
Whether this event becomes a spark that burns the flame of mass movement is still unclear.
"I'm going to make a brain lie on average"
Among fans of modern virtual technology, virtual reality is a popular theme of expanded reality; it has recently meant to capture the world, especially through the borders of special glasses.
At the beginning of the year at its annual conference, Google presented the working model of this news and in November it was announced that Microsoft also submitted a request for a relevant patent.
From the interview with the leading group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadim, it appears that for the scientists of this company there are glasses already past.
The perspective is to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands, to create virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us the frame, what's your research group doing?
We're dealing with man's interactions with machines, but at the same time, we're trying to move the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, mankind has stuck in the stage of work with pixels on the flat screen, at least sometimes touching the screens with their fingers.
We want to look at 5-10 years in advance and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect recorders - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect recorders, because for all it is very interesting to manage using gestures.
- What else is waiting for us in the future?
- Despite the fact that Kinect's system transferred interaction to the physical level, a lot of interaction is still taking place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input stream has improved (the system accepts a larger amount of data), but the output stream so far has been in no particular.
We're trying to change it, we're really working on three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projectives.
You need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid helmets virtual reality!
- What do you think of voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it worth it?
- Of course, he cannot be considered a general - a private question arises because we do not always want to inform others in our area about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about different ones, just such expensive, short ones.
The gesture would not look like a camera, but a bracelet that would watch the movements of bones and muscles.
He's still big, but theoretically he can be reduced to the size of a bracelet watch.
Generally speaking, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as the gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, that'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to take the user to step up what the machine can or can't do at the moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future, we will have to work primarily on developing new types of recorders that can more accurately identify the human response.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide a relatively good deep resolution, which is very important.
- Do you have to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough divorce today, depth, or anything else?
- Basically, the current generation - that's what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just about megapixels alone, but like math and depth.
At the current point of view, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this contributes to the work of algorithm designers.
So we need to keep in mind not only the resolution in X and Y axes, but also Z.
So it's also very important to speed, the number of images per second.
The human movement is relatively dynamic and current data streams of 30 images per second are frankly said a little bit, especially for the guests.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch-on recorder with a adjustable delay of processing from 1 to 100 ms, while the current, serially manufactured recorders are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not every person understands how this affects a person's interaction with machines.
For me at work, there would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, but I don't need so much touch, but I need some photos in a second.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect system now uses three cameras, one of which is actually the infrared transmitter and the other - the receiver of the reflected signal.
And now the third camera - it's actually a normal visual tape recorder.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or worsen it because it would increase the required volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible kinect analogue system, play with curved camera placement and see how it helps to determine a three-dimensional position.
- If I remember well, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) didn't publicly present his glasses.
You don't think that if it's about the daily use of technology extended reality using special glasses, it's one of the strongest platforms?
- Of course to walk, and still to keep smatphone in the raised hand is not very comfortable, but I think the most powerful variant would be the "weird" image of the expansion of reality when it would be possible to switch from the clouds platform to the smartphone, the projection display and further around.
Bryl - it's a very personal device, it's their strength (only you see the perfect things), and at the same time a weakness - extended reality based on the bryl will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time as other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no response to the question!
Hands don't feel anything!
What is your group's response to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the extended reality - it's the seventh one going through the gap in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the supplementing of humid hints could be a eight-step break.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is being used - using the second hand as a certain type of background for the display.
It's an excellent way to record the pressure!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding mass to these "images in the air" - for example, interference of some directional ultrasonic dots at a defined point, where the finger is located, triggers a cloudy feeling, but it is still very weak - as if you were staring at a finger.
There is also a strap on the wrist, which affects the nerve joint in the fingers - also the promised direction.
- You've been trying to fool your brain?
To think he's feeling what he's supposed to feel at that point when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to accept a person who is physically located in a very small space to believe that it is a short open, practically endless space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not like clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If the brain is turned into a target, it's still work for many years.
This is what works on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in simple beginnings.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrohradská avantgarda", dedicated to the citizens who are in charge of avantgarda culture and art.
At the top of the list, there have already been significant developments in the Petrohrad’s production scene, whose profits exceed the city’s scope, often find recognition in Europe without reaching a full reputation.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is an amazing producer of Cyril Miller.
The whole city is known as Cyril Miller - a man who is all dressed in red, which you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Gardens, here in fashion halls and on the landscapes.
The images of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed, always attract the gifts of the spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical petro-hrading editors, the creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - this is an ideal man of petro-hrading avantgarde at the end of 80 and early 90s.
Besides being a city man, his teeth on the streets make a smile on the faces of the citizens, raise the mood.
He recently took the bottle into his hand and became a petro-hradian bottler, because he grew up to this complex role in his entire divine life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why are you walking all over the city in red and not in yellow or in turquoise, for example?
- I chose a red color as a designer with visual and image.
In this world, the red color is a compromise between artist, imagemaker and public.
It may be that everything that is slightly different from gray becomes aggressive and breeds bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on being tied to a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is, above all, an invitation to debate.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- The exhibition in the House of Culture in Nevska, where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my way is.
At that time, I was unable to understand the waves of old unofficial artists and the new, free types of artists.
I was friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gasonists who brought us to Puškinský 10 and there were no other waves.
I like the theater, the clothes, the music, all the genres except for the words.
- And it all happened in your art clinic... - It was important for me to feel at the center of the culture of Petěrburku, where all the best forces of creation should be gathered.
In 1995 I held a place on Puskinské 10, and there was a music-art-club, Bohema club, a house in the cavern.
There were many: NOM, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how Schnura brought with the project "Ucho Van Gogha".
Snur and his friends sang a light song, dressed in adjacent tricotts, among them composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg has led many programs of the Gali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtěnberg, starting his big career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribodeov - it's Art Clinic.
This is where our workers leave and stay guests.
I'm a hero of the past century when culture meant something else.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press, and the special price was "People in Our City".
I was named after the artist of the year, which ended my peak.
In new times, according to old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, piety and culture of the past century.
In recent years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your work is a distinctive way of recognizing it.
- Many of my images - these are the hits in which the present and the periphery is alive.
I'm going to have a program show "Russian Museum in Clunes".
Clowns are an overtime category.
I used to be social, today being such is painful and terrible.
But in the clowns, it's all crazy, it's a tragedy.
I love grotesque, my grotesque ideas.
For example, save the world by the way of totalitarian transformation in the order of order.
Today, people meet according to their clothes, focusing on external mechanics, not on the inner person.
Or maybe he can't give him a hand and he needs to swim in his face.
And the curse will be removed by the removal of the garment.
- We recently saw you as a city bottler. - The cultural city should have such a hero.
And who's supposed to be if it wasn't for me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There's a breakdown in culture.
Before, people met in noises, God loved one, just the other people.
It's all broken up in micro communities today, it's very hard to get into it all today.
I'm not a hundred-dollar banker to like everyone.
We need to think about who you like today.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And there will be a few thousand spectators at St. Michael's!
- He's got fans coming in, and there's a sexual social environment involved.
And 300 people and 10,000 will not come to the cultural land, and the result is less management, money, everything is worthwhile.
I've got fans, the main thing is that no one's going to blame them or interrupt what they're used to.
When I was young, I painted images of someone who hung on a wall with Falke and Lario.
I started with images that most people end up with.
Today, people are often confused.
They say:Culture spiritual, culture of consumption.
There's no culture of consumption, it's disgusting.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who refused money for painting images.
And I'm for that kind of culture.
- Cyril, what's missing in Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a concept: an actor through culture.
Not every one of them, but they can deal with culture.
In the time of the proper kings, it was not so in all, the emperors may not have understood much of the culture, but they understood that it was necessary to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in Petrohrada who might be experts, but they're in shock somewhere because they need great experts who properly evaluate these experts and they'll lead them on the right path.
It's a taste that thrives today.
Tataz Erart, but it's different from saying that, frankly, that we don't accept all modern art, there are artists who should be looking for another museum.
- What do you think of Peterburk?
- Peterburk - it's not the main city of culture, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's the right land.
And in our east, art is being done with care.
We need cultural land, but we have more writers today than readers, it's bad.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
It's just a weak layer in us.
We need art to become fashionable, as it was in the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented through St. Petersburg Grant
Rotated Into Space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
The caravans of spaceships with land on board are on their way, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the main question arises: How to keep your family in conditions of unhappiness or on a given replacement planet?
I don't think the choice is a big one.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be won, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a highly-established scientist at the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Šternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, on the surface of Venus, temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius.
Living there is only possible at great heights or at the orbit of Venus... in space.
To answer the questions of reproduction in the universe, scientists began with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were made on plants.
Four generations of toys grown on the street are nothing different from their earthly relatives.
Then was the removal of the mucus to orbit - very small fruity men of Drosophila.
In 1979 there were sent to the universe a butterfly egg to verify how the embryo develops in a state of weakness.
We get an absolutely normal bird at the exit.
But then problems begin.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird has to find resistance, it has to build on its own feet and start moving," says the leading laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If they don't find resistance, the chaotic birds will fall and do coarse eggs.
After 10 hours, freshly fried birds came to a complete denture of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, they just died in four days.
" Twice we let the birds suck, but then we refused, because it's just impossible to work with them there," comments the failure of the experiment with chicken in the universe Vladimir Sychev.
The last "miniar" of the animals flew on the round road 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
Bion's biosatellite, but they'll only be one sex.
There was an experiment with rats that were already pregnant in the universe.
In fact, they didn't reveal anything supernatural.
"It was only in the biosatelites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such attempts must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the earth, the descendants of the cosmic subcontinent were born.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of propagating directly into space.
It's a difficult task.
Animals simply cannot carry out their sexual instincts when losing their normal environment.
A man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens governs abstract thinking and is able to create the right emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying to space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was the threat of the Tireskov.
The most precious thing humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Chaika flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if they'd take flight to space.
If he can give birth after that year.
"No one has answered this question yet," says the veteran of the rocket-space sector of the Vachtang Vakanjadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after the summer into space, the first woman-cosmonaut Valentin Těreškova was born.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut of Andrian Nikolai.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-cosmonaut of Svetlanje Savique was born, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in the open space.
But the risk remains.
We only have a few cosmonauts that have been born after many years and increase the health of the offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even in orbital years," says the Cosmonaut-pilot, the Soviet Union's Hedrain and the Russian Valerij Poljakov.
Nevertheless, mankind must inevitably look for new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydro-laboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here, under the conditions of zero attractiveness, the cosmonauts win the habits needed to work in open space.
The water's a bit like a state of unhappiness.
For adults, water may be comfortable, but in a strange way, for young children it is natural to live.
Little yachters seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between being on average 9 months in the mother’s fruit water and making it easier for them to get on the water.
In principle, it is logical because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first redemption, only 2 weeks will come.
"It's very little for the child to forget something," says the swim instructor Marina Aksenov.
In short - if for a newborn baby the condition is not difficult to natural, then for women is more natural inevitable gravity, attractive force.
In the state of unhappiness, the body’s ability to fertilize is very rapid.
We can leave this aside if the muscle stimulators are working at birth.
Finally, it is possible to pass the birth into a special chamber in which the mother’s body will pour out the fruit.
"What's next?" asked Valerij Poljak's complex questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism is not attracted to land, it cannot properly shape the body or the muscle system.
New births on the circuit are not possible clothing as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He's just gonna get rid of what he needs for his development.
"If we go with you into an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a healthy person to Earth who will be totally unappropriated to the present environment," the head commission for the bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov predicts.
So the birth of children in space today is just a theoretical question.
However, the time will come when the earth will become a reality and when the earth will be evicted in its crusts on a distant planet that will become home to their offspring born in the universe.
Head of NKU: Control of the poor system has failed to blame the politicians
In relation to public procurement, the Czech Republic has good controllers and quality legislation, but is in favour of its application.
In the conversation for Current.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office Miloslav Kala says that.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that is what we think is lacking," comments Kala's current situation.
Similar conclusions also indicate joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of the wrong practice, Peter does not occasionally approach the so-called "swift system".
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not burden the entrepreneur with his controls - is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be somewhat set up, and if it prohibits anything, neither the president of the government shall be able to prevent the operation of the office which is obliged to monitor and enforce obligations," Kala notes.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Ambassador's Chamber, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly was that about?
It's a parallel check we started about two years ago.
It is simply said that European legislation regulates the way in which public procurement is handled, followed by individual national legislation and then by practice itself.
We have put all of this together, and even though control is not yet completed, we have shown very interesting differences - in general the legislation is possible for us to be more precise and perfect, but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to continue to create more precise rules, but it is necessary to apply the law itself.
What can this project actually help you with, what's it going to do for you?
Such a joint control could help us stop trying to simplify the laws, reduce and improve the limits if it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to exclude enrichment and, if appropriate, criminal proceedings.
But by reducing the limit of orders, we don't have to make it.
Perhaps the system is paying for such a amount of "paper", that those who want to search for holes in this system will be much simpler than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about foreign problems with the transposition of public procurement legislation.
How does the German control system work?
Is the office here similar to our NKU, or is it set up otherwise?
As for the offices, just like the NKU, the Bundesrecundnhof, which is organized just like us, has a college, it's just a little bit different, but in principle both offices are acting the same way.
The powers are also similar to those of Germany, however, because it has gender arrangements, so it has these accounting courts and at the level of individual sex countries - in this way the system differs slightly from ours.
BRH can only control the total money, represented by state resources.
Public funds, which are managed by countries and by foreigners, are controlled there from the level of social accountants.
What about darker legislation, so that's easier than ours?
In general, without specific data, I would not like to compare it, but in some respects Germany has been designated as a model, but it cannot be said that it is better at all.
So it's also the fact that they have better controllers?
I certainly don't, but I'm saying again, I don't like this comparison.
But we have to say that even countries that we consider to be model are facing a whole range of problems.
Otherwise, it would be no advantage for them to cooperate with our office, wouldn't it?
With regard to foreign legislation, what did the new law on public procurement mean for your office?
Since the period of validity of this novel is relatively short, it is not yet in control actions.
Because we're doing ex post checks, we need to count with a certain delay.
We have observed this so far only in the process of preparing future controls - we have started our new "risk detection" tool, through which we have found almost 14,000 public orders, and we have analyzed them - these changes will obviously appear there because the limits, the conditions of some types of selection are adjusted and similar.
So do you consider the approval of this law to be more beneficial, or any other burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can arise here is that the rules are "stricken" and it will not be possible to follow them.
For the purposes of the previous rules, controlled persons are already bound by the supplier (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the public procurement law means a breach of the budget.
Does the law, then, have the value of making it easier to do so?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, not punish those who will allow a formal doubt that does not affect the decision-making process.
Such a system will create only greater pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do you get out of this?
Let's see where the road doesn't lead.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not burden the business operator with the control of the so-called "swift system" - and what does that mean?
Is the cleaning system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be somewhat established, and if it prohibits anything, it cannot prevent the president of the government from acting in the office which is obliged to monitor and enforce obligations.
He can say, "Let's change this law and let it go," but he can't say that we're going to do like nothing.
In the law on public procurement, there are relatively strict rules as to what is formally implemented - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when an interested person with the best offer is excluded only for formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what we think is missing.
The roads are steep, but most roads
In several places the Czech Republics are narrow and snowy roads.
Most of the time, though, cars are moving, somewhere with increased caution.
Country of Karlovar
In the area of Karlovar, this morning the roads were snowy, but quiet, and also snowy.
The temperature fell between five and ten degrees below zero, but during the day it should be slightly heated.
Snowing has risen in the region and is only a weak level in the lowlands.
On the hills of the Crusades, however, is about 30 centimeters of snow.
The places were also lower visibility due to the noise, resulting from the data of the country road traffic controllers.
The R6 motorways and the first class communication are now accessible in the region without restriction.
However, caution is in place, for example, at some crossings, where the surface can be smooth and smooth.
Passengers are also all roads of the second and third classes including mountain roads.
In some cases, however, the leftovers of frozen snow are still on them.
In particular, in higher positions, increased attention should be paid to driving.
Pardubic and Královéhradeký
On some roads in the eastern Czech Republic, the threat of freezing, in higher places and mountains can be covered on the communication level of snow, informs on its pages the Directorate of Roads and Roads.
Motorists warn drivers before freezing, can be formed in particular in the higher places of the Pardubic region.
It can be located around Lanškronu, Ústí nad Orlica, Polička, Svitav or High Myth, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemicals are treated on roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitav.
The snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Eagle Mountains.
The hidden snow level is in the highest locations on the roads in the periods of Richnov nad Kniežen and Trutnov.
In the eastern Czech Republic, the most common thing is clear today, with no strike.
Temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree of Celsia, a weak wind blows.
Plzeńský kraj
Roads in the Plzeňska country are travelling this morning, but with increased caution and driving it is necessary to adjust the weather.
It's after the cold wound, the temperatures move between three and nine degrees below the freezing point.
After previous snowing and subsequent cooling, some communication may be inflexible.
The locations must also be counted with silence, but visibility will improve gradually.
It comes from the information of the national road traffic controllers.
The D5 area is almost unrestricted, but increased caution is recommended by communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Plzeńsk and Tachovska, however, there may be some rough cuts.
The second and third classes of communication are wet and, in this case, there is also a warning on tidal sections.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent routes in the forest area.
Olomoucian Country
With snowfall on the road today they have to count drivers heading to the highest places in the Olomouk region.
After a chemical examination, she remained on the Red Sea seat and on the road towards the Videlian Cross.
On the night of the snow, the motorists in the field, on Schumpersk according to the road managers, snowed about three centimeters [3 cm].
In other parts of the country, vehicles are mostly free of restrictions.
"Shumpers are in the highest position of the rest of the snow.
With the snowfall on the Črvenohor seat, drivers must count towards Jeseník," CTK today told the Sümperian Road Administration.
In the evening, their colleagues on Jesenick also went out, the roads to the highest places now according to them are bare and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouck there are roads that travel without restriction, however, in Šternberska drivers should pay attention to the forest sections where the vehicles remained wet.
Austniký kraj, Liberecký kraj
A few difficult travel places are reported today after a road trip to the north of Czech Republic.
In addition to several places with snow or ice cream, the mountain road from Telnice na Knínice na Ústecka is also closed from the police database.
Temperatures are also maintained in lower places below zero, so ice and snow are likely to last on roads.In the lowlands, especially in the south-east of the Czech Central, there are no problems, and roads are dry.
Traffic complications have not yet been reported.
The presence of the glaciers is reported by the motorists, especially in the area of Štěti.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for it at night - over the rainy day and rising snow, at night clear and cold.
From the main tracks there are also adverse conditions on the I/13 road within the Ústek and Libereck region.
The closure from Telnice na Knínica has been opened to the bent branches of trees that are bent under the snow to the driver.
Shimon Ornest: We want to pool positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in a month or so?
It's just one of the other scary news that we people like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we make fun of it more and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to distance or prevent it from the end of the world.
In December, you will also organize a completely united project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers?
It's a state-wide benefit action that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the May calendar announced on December 21st at 11:10 a.m.
The day before 20 December, since 21 hours, 3 concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end will be near the time when the Mayan calendar will end on the island of Kiribati in Tichomore, which is in the time zone 12 hours before us.
Who came with this idea?
It was probably my idea at first, and then we've all come up with our producer Honzo August.
In addition to the fact that we want to pool enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about how we once deliver this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we also created unique collections of objects, boots, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support by buying at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap Group along with other interpreters also sang a so-called Hymna against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Canceled".
She's already very popular on YouTube today, is she also sounding at these beneficial concerts?
Of course, and it's in complete conclusion, so if we can all succeed and the end of the world doesn't happen...
All the performers sing it at all three concerts simultaneously.
Hymnas are also offered on a unique direct broadcast on Czech television.
He wrote words to this song and the main role of Jesus in the clip plays Tomás Hanák, also singing Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of beneficial events and concerts...
We're trying hard to get them involved in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested and entertaining in our cooperation.
What's the outcome of the concerts against the end of the world?
At the equipment of the Studeo Barrier Education Centre, which we have been implementing for six years with the Civil Society Tap in the Jedlik Institute.
Students of Jedlik's school regularly attend and devote themselves to activities that are fun and interesting.
The students alone do not have the means to give themselves up as lecturers, so we try to enable them to do so.
Within the framework of the provision of the Jedlik Institute in the future, there will be a separate building to which we will move with this project.
There will be several music groups and interpreters at each concert.
What did you pick them for?
We've tried to set up a program that's going on for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinese, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bartou, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suchý will show.
For more information, please contact www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombistic actions" to the future?
In May we will first go out in the Prague Spring, so here we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we'd also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I would like to connect it with the show in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalistic, for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of men with disabilities.
How do you manage these routes logistically and organizationally?
It's not as scary as it looks at first sight.
We have five members on the electric vehicle, its vehicles have to travel in a dedicated space, and of course we're running a large amount of charge and poor with tools...
However, it has always been without problems, the ČSA and British Airways have been very prepared for us, that I've been looking at how many times.
Even in Moscow, which we came back from recently, it was without any problems.
You can compare how each individual varies in barriers, public access to disabled people, and so on.
What'd you meet up with before?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do, we witnessed in Russia that everything is still at the top.
On the contrary, Moscow is a very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person on the electric vehicle to move himself in the city centre.
They don't even pay the obvious, as if you'd prefer the riders in the elevator.
Luckily, there is a civil society that is trying to alert people to the problems of the disease.
And what, on the other hand, do we still have to push out the more prosperous countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
It is important, however, to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's quite common that even people with a severe disability are moving to the public, they can go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
But it's not too common that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on the contrary we're with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respecting the public or barrage is one thing, but only when we have important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things will really start to change.
So far, there are isolated cases of people who have strong will.
The Tap Tap chapel is currently very popular, but let's go back in a few years what made you put it on?
I was an educator at the Yedlik Institute, where I had a lot of young people around me who were interested in something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I'm playing a saxophone, so I started an interesting music circuit with my colleague.
Well, in time, as our moderator Ládja Angelovic says, a little out of hand (smiles).
But the popularity has come up in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started communicating with well - known singers and also actively working on promoting the band.
It turns out that work that you don't see is basically like it didn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can allow quality readers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to touch it with The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something else.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one resembles the other.
It's logical in its own way, everything new is taken care of and it takes a long time.
Things that are lonely are very few, but I'm trying to argue that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us first is, of course, sorry, it's natural...
But this pity is totally unnecessary, because people with a hen are not suffering from all the abandoned creatures that we have to regret.
They are people who can live a meaningful life and develop, of course, provided they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with a manipulative, it's not just moving for them, it's for the whole company.
Has this success also helped you to be a strict boss, how many people have labeled you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be non-compromised in many things and require certain discipline.
But I think it's totally normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic performance and head in the neighborhoods, and when they find out that they have to go for a two-week test, get on the product and spend a lot of time on the concert trails, the enthusiasm is quick to let go.
But that's how it works everywhere in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
At present, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people are leaving and coming, it can't be prevented.
Whoever wants and likes is always open to us
The day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
In Prague Incheba arena, Brno Flédě and Ostrava Plynoj for 12 chapels and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities offer a telemost in a common song of the chapel The Tap Tap "The End of the World Canceled"
The aim of the concert is to raise funding for the provision of the STUDEO multifunctional wireless education centre in Prague at the Jedlikka Institute, amounting to 25 million CZK
Access to the concert is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years of age have free admission tickets to the Bohemiaticket pre-sale
Polish to Cosmos.
Last week, Poland was adopted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency, as a second country from the country of the former Eastern bloc (hereinafter Czech Republic, which became a fully-fledged member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of Agency projects over the next few years.
However, Poland's journey to the cosmos began a long time ago.
For years the Polish people were devoted to space before the second world war, but they did not always meet with understanding.
For example, I would like to mention a lecture by A. Šternfeld in Warsaw's astronomical observatorium, which, on 6 December 1933, presented ideas from his work on the progressive entrance to the cosmonautics.
The thoughts of a young engineer (1905) left the listeners cold and after years, Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
Šternfeld won the prize of Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirscha for entrance to the cosmonautique in France in 1934.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major advocate of astronomy and cosmonautiques.
In Polish newspapers he published hundreds of articles and wrote a series of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned propagandist of cosmonautique and his benefit was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the reverse side of the moon was named by his name.
In 1925 a railway dredging was built in Poland, which was to be measured by a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and is not known to the details of the project.
It is not clear whether the rocket should have been used for or for the derailment of the drain.
Information about this area is only known from time to time.
As early as 1933, the Polish branch began to operate with rocket missiles.
The research has provided the Nuclear Technology Cell in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
Of the materials stored, it is clear that research has grown into the stages of practical tests.
However, the arrival of the German army was interrupted.
In 1937, a draft photoelectrical racing rocket, designed by Rohozinski and released the work of the rocket - torpedo air and rocket bomb by the author of Leliwy-Krzywoblock, appeared in the professional press.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Temphasy Advisory Committee) was dedicated to all projects of military use of missile technology, which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, the war ended.
Further work done by the cosmonauts after the war in the Polish press is found thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautische Society (Polish Association of Astronautiques).
The first is a reference to the company in the November issue of the 1954 issue of the Problem magazine, in which there are four more comprehensive articles dedicated to astronauts.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowice, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with cosmonautics.
At that time, the projects of the artificial compañeros were already underway and it was clear that space research was a prospective area.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) has sought to join the International Astronautic Federation (based in 1951) and has already become a proper member in the autumn of the PTA.
And next year, PTA President Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronaut Federation.
This function lasted until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has played a significant role in the development of highly successful meteorological missiles RM (Meteorological Rocket), which became the first Polish rocket to be carried out by scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first started on October 10, 1958.
The 1,800-meter access rocket was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, two-stage RM-2 rockets were launched in the Bledovian Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another type of development should already have been able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have access to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
However, in 1962 another development was suspended.
As a successor to the first RM-type rocket, the Meteor-1 missile was developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed to be two-dimensional, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (labelled Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, which vary in size of space for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket space was available with a volume of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 litres.
Maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first summer tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting mass of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg to the height of about 60 km.
The following versions were built: Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the national committee COSPAR two years later.
Poland also participated in space exploration in the Intercosmos programme in Soviet art teams, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remkovi.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court violated the Public Works Act.
The motion for a resolution has led to a lively debate among the public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader point of view.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalised world, are based on more unregulated economic competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic services, national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between themselves.
This is why the principle of free trade and free movement of private capital is destroyed, with unrestricted financial speculation.
As a result of significant differences in the price of work, there is a price tension.
In this respect, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer is trying to import cheap goods into economic competition by "getting" the price of the competitor in order to increase its market share and thereby increase its own profits.
In the mass measure, this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer production to a foreign country, or to buy cheaply, or to go away.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
As private capital has no social responsibility and thus also the responsibility for its job created, the social expenditure of the State is increasing.
The whole situation contributes to the complete unhappiness of the businessmen to pay taxes and thus to replace the economic and social damage that he has caused in the profit margin.
The situation is so widely known that specific statistical data should not be provided.
Independent private capital practices create a situation in individual economies where governments of individual countries are forced to enter mutual competition with a view to artificially reducing the social level of their own population to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are giving private capital the benefit of their own population regardless of the social breakdown.
This is particularly evident in changes in the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept the price dictatorship of private capital, in particular in the area of wages.
This is, however, a system of economic recovery in the case of long-term unemployment, but a restriction on the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty, along with growing disparities between the poor and the rich.
In the SRN, there have been a number of years of public food spending for the poor who cannot enjoy their own work.
The number of these people is going to go to millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is common to find that decently employed people receive wages such that they must be paid to an existing minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary workers in the sex trade.
The controversial measures of practically all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same state when people under the pressure of a catastrophic social decline are forced either to migrate as it was in the 19th century or to live for a cold wage on the edge of society in hopes that private investment capital will come to the country once.
Where is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
If it is from other EU countries, poverty is moving from one country to another, or it does not come at all, because China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, or Africa are still working for a European wall break.
It's all about Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim that the state cannot take part in its own economy, that the managed economy leads to economic disaster.
The private capital shall be considered as not to involve the State in the management of the activities of the economy.
Then we need to ask ourselves if private capital is not affected, now it is the policy that governs the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here's a clear answer, yes.
Evidence is practically omnipotent and in all states an accessible lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where virtually everything is punishable, but nothing criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is such that the government ministries for the lack of financial resources are putting forward proposals for laws to private legal firms that are weak in connection with industry.
These draft laws are subsequently approved in the Bundestag.
Not all come from people like Western institutions, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberally oriented democracy is now rapidly getting into the situation, as Appianos describes it in his part of the crisis of the Roman Republic in the times of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in full disparity and the authorities have been obsessed with violence.
For fees, illegal acquisitions and by means of stones or swords.
The payoff and corruption were inconceivable and people went to elections with a pre-sold voice" ..."character people didn't even care about the office, so once, as a result of this riot, it was eight months without consoles." . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The conclusion, as in the past, is based on the unbiased preference of its own interests, regardless of the social interest.
Private capital is no longer capable of grasping and applying social benefits from its substance.
The result is now, as it was then, an unprecedented decade of elite without any effort to reform a deeper race.
Therefore, we must seek to liberalise the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries in an undisputed manner of fascist and communist regimes.
At present, the absence of these systems in favour of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain interruption with the expectation of another cycle.
In particular, the disastrous fact is that the present elites are totally ignoring possible statistical losses in the lives, humanitarian and social disasters that we are now witnessing together with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new times.
The repeal of the Law on Public Works is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at international and at European level, the Czech Government will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is aimed at political and social reforms that strengthen the State's participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: A laboratory of chaos.
"With violence nothing comes and never can" Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the refren is "do not forget how we are sinners"
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would be no one" dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, many reactions were generated.
One stands behind Israel, argues his right to self-defence, and the Palestinians match the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue against the racist state of Israel, genocide in the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel matches the role of the terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who is in periodically repeating waves of the killing of the culprits and who is the victim, the end of today's Israelis, including self-righteous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I am going to offer the readers a look at the tire, a look at which, above all, has been serving 95 years of tension (calculated by the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small corner of the Middle East.
Some of my views are supported by the historical facts available some of them are taken away on the basis of my own understanding of who the group of people is the main characters of the events of modern history.
The facts of mankind are first of all history of the struggle for power.
In each episode, we can look for someone like Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What's not so obvious is whether it's always these personalities who have completely autonomously driven their steps and whether or not someone behind their throne has become the focus of their actions towards the stated purpose.
We have to admit that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that flows from it could not be attained by one generation.
Among these astronomical rich families is one that could be considered the head of the cemetery (if anyone is still standing over them I don't know, but I don't exclude it) - Rothschild.
It's not much about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) has already been bought in the 1990s to stop the merger of its name with the highly criminal consequences of which they have stood and which have always meant the strengthening of power, increase of wealth or both.
They have major shares in almost all the central banks of the world and against the countries where the central bank shares do not lead or prepare wars (before the attack of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the defeat of Kaddafi, only four were left, but in the meantime Russia subjugated the central bank of the Russian government).
Whoever tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the central bank of Rothschild's Bank of America, began to spend his own money during the civil war and was murdered in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began to issue his own money and wanted to destroy the FED, was murdered in 1963, and MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to appeal to the FED for a major economic crisis in 1929.
In 1859 - 1871, their desire for global power led to the formulation of the plan of the three world wars of the highest zodiac, the 33rd phase of Albert Pike.
The first war was intended to remove large monarchy states in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial rule, particularly Britain, and the third is leading to the reduction of the world population somewhere to 0.5 to 1 billion people (such as the number of slaves for their conveniences and luxury is sufficient and need not so much resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a preponderance for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method used by a group of the richest families in front of Rothschieldy is the call for a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab chao - order of chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, so that the crisis like the one they called in 1907 does not happen again).
So after they succeeded in the murder of the Habsburg successor R-U throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo to disband the first world war, the Russian Empire destroyed by the launch of the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly, military and economically unresolved, the capital of Germany (there was no need for a war to destroy the Russian Empire), followed by a break-up of the central European power, Austria Uherska.
In order to facilitate the resolution of the second world war, the politicians left behind the latent conflict situation by making huge war repairs on Germany, creating the assumption of radicalisation of the masses of people and then simply supporting the Germans with sufficient strength, marking and simple solutions offered by the leader, and further creating a multi-national Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, who had to multiply, as well as bending, the functions of the fifth colony, at the start of the war fire.
By the end of the 19th century, Rothschild’s foundation of Zionist movement, whose one sentence sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem, would be the main city (return to Zion).
As already mentioned, the Balfour declaration created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and it began to reach first sights with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The second world war broke out if Hitler was cut off from the chain on which he was held by international bankers at first, or anything he had done was difficult to estimate, then the European Jews' suffering in concentration created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like the war repairs made by Germany in World War II, a third war fire was created by the declaration of the State of Israel.
If it is managed by international bankers, the Jewish nation, like in the second, will be the victims of the first line of war, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of light and chaos not only within the country, but also in an international scale (we take only as a strong share of people for Israel's favor and support).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim of the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where the crime is brought about by violence in the endless chain of violence when, at the beginning of all, the poverty of individuals and their desire for global power became a thing of the past?
It is here that the simple people of Israel need to be distinguished from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are urging people to vote in elections exclusively their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascising, loyal international bankers, a policy that is doing its utmost to resolve the war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in Shanghai's Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to increase in global conflict and in view of Iran's control over the Hormuz Peninsula, which travels 20% of all world oil (the navigation corridor only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of lords and slaves.
The world where the rest of the human population serves the comforts of the wealthy financial aristocracy.
The world where every new birth unit is implanted in the birth of a chip that makes it a fully controlled being.
"And compels all the small and great, rich and poor, free and slave to have on their right hand or on their foreheads, that they may not buy or sell, who is not marked by the name of the beast or the number of its name.
That's what we need to understand: who has the mind to count the numbers of the slum.
That number marks a person and that's the number six-six-six."
Film Argo: When worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, he held a band of demonstrator Islamic students at the American Embassy in Tehran and hired 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released as a substitute for the proposed state of Mohammed Réz Páhalhvi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, which was the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive exit - it could not afford to cast a trap overboard, because it would essentially endanger the trust of allies in other countries.
The release of the hostages, however, in Iran, where the revolution ceased in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not able to achieve.
It was the dawn of the United States' prestige, which later deepened the fiasco's attempt to free power.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days after the settlement was mediated by the Algerian government.
Their contribution to the house caused by the freeness of solidarity and the anti-Irish feeling.
The debate in Iran has contributed significantly to the loss of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the story that America brought a small victory.
Just before the embassy was held, six employees fled.
They ended up living in a Canadian embassy after a complicated perieptia.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them from Iran, while helping the extravagant cover story - went to Canadian passports as a film staff who watched the country's venue for filming a big movie.
Combination of genres
A plan that invented an expert on exfiltration, Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood cooperation.
For legends to be reliable, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, organized a press conference, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been hidden for a long time, the film comes from Tony Mendez's memory.
Afklek's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realisticly perceived political thriller, at the same time called "caper movie", a story of a piece, sometimes - can be an example of Danny's series of partners.
In the film, the moods - on one side of a documentary sequence from Tehran (the title sequence shows the iconic time photography of events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences in that).
On the other hand, isolated passages from Hollywood, combined with irony and a slight oversupply.
And then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in the suit break up the situation at the operating tables, at the office halls, on the phone...
Ben's Affleck has made a remarkable effort to restart his career.
From a funny actor, he became a respected director, and his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third film all night, after the dark crime of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Afleck's video that's not being played in Boston's home directory.
Cit for the atmosphere of the place, however, was among the characteristics that the director's older films increased above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows him in Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are played in the streets, when real events are reconstructed - the initial sequence of the embassy's fall is in its overview, which also mediates the emotions of confusion and invisibility that occur when history is cleared somewhere.
Similar effects of Affleck and his collaborators are found in the scene of thought (false staff on the Tehran Basar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story in question does not actually offer much in the film-making sense of the tense scenes.
It's not working well enough, sometimes it's actually thinking about something - it's not all so elegantly coming out there (the scene in which the threatening crisis at the Tehran airport is turning off calls in America and the hunt after the wound is a lot attracted to the hair).
The weak Arga, however, is the dissipation resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in the role of Hollywood co-workers who are very charming, but their figures would deserve more space and are not far from alone in this film.
Afklek's film so loses a little dramatic tach, it's a picture that can be monitored with a little interest, evaluate the realization and retro style evocating thrilllers in the 70s.
But it's just hard.
As a reminder of one way to date, living history and the evidence of the overreached ideas of all powerful and all - aware secret services, but it will suffice.
Rules for pumping balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipopakky.com, which publishes a survey of the most absurd banking charges each year, has now decided to declare the competition "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU industry".
"It has led us to this last event when the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," said the Law Organizer Patrick Naker.
For example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the merger of insurance rates for men and women is already among the nominated absurdities.
So far, women have been benefited from life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will then take place by the end of February 2013," Naker reported.
The EU controversial regulation also requires the mandatory inclusion of biofuels in fuel matter, which, as a result of damage to nature, further prohibits the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of hazardous substances or a directive on the size of the glue, which has significantly affected the eggs this year.
The criticism was also faced by the fact that the expression of anointed butter or the removal of classical candles from the sale was not used.
Quality bananas should have 14 centimeters
The Union apparatus often decides under the pressure of the commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels are usually met by some state or group of States (the Czech Republic now and the threat of veta advocates the requirements of its banks).
Lobby's loans were also due to the fact that bananas of the highest quality had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and should not show "anonymous distortion".
At the same time, the European Commission has defended itself by harmonising only today's incompatible national standards that have complicated trade.
The EU's standards of fruit and vegetables through resistance from some states have confused with the fact that existing directives lead to food consumption.
The candidate for the victory in the poll may also be the last EU regulation, which requires that children under 8 years of age should not be inflamed without the supervision of adults.
The EU has turned to American research, which says balloons between players are the leading cause of children's death to drowning.
Similar restrictions are now applicable for children under 14 years of age when they are exposed to perforations.
Curious ideas are born at home
It is quite absurd, then, the rule regarding European officials themselves - everyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia, given the sensitivity of the theme for Greece, and must instead talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The Banking Fees.com server, in cooperation with the association of liberal economies Laissez Faire, nominated for the polls in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdity rules on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has set maximum levels of food stocks that could be found in the territory of the PRC on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the established volumes in preserved caves, which threatened him with a high penalty.
The survey organizers also raised the idea of paying to some countries because they do not have the sea, and the idea of granting grants on request for grants.
But these ideas did not come to Brussels, but to Prague.
"We are disabled by having no sea.
We call on the European Union to repay," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the autumn of 2004.
As the argument stated, we were born with a lot of cereals and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, we had to be filled with stocks that had to be exported.
Because the Czech Republic continues to have ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission came out of the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant grant was offered to the local government by Minister Paul Germany (US-DEU) for Local Development, specifically to write a request for a grant from Brussels.
EU: Bistrial Regulation is an exception
Although the regulations in the Member States are easy to come up with criticism, EU regulatory efforts and, at the same time, more efficient functioning and development across the Union deserve recognition, according to a number of experts.
The most serious problem is, according to experts, for example, the allocation of EU grants to projects that have no indication of anything in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have won in budgetary negotiations.
Emotion between the Czech Republic and the other Union countries also requires the Czech Republic to fight on the right to the specific labelling of its traditional products in Brussels, which is not always successful in this conflict.
Although after the 6th war with Germany and the Rakušanas, the marking of the Olomoucian molds, however, the foreign rum, whose tradition reaches the 19th century, had to be named by our producers.
The name of rum may be carried only products of trimming distillate, not of sugar beet.
In the official list of EU registered products, in the company of world-famous cheeses of feta and gorgonzol, marzipan from Germany, Lübeck or parm hams, for example, carlovar sugar, roasting and wheat carp, and barley.
The EU's protection mark can then be proud of the pardubic pen and the hot tubs.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, hard Ocamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a person think he wants to run for the president?
I don't care if I'm a senator or president.
If it worked in our country without problems, I wouldn't give up.
But I can't see how the country's been stealing for the last 20 years, how the thieves are running, people are increasing their income tax and their retirement age.
I shouldn't have been a politician.
But if I see something I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I've been 40 years old and I'm an independent non-citizen, I have no other way to influence things than to run for a senator or president.
You've reached the Senate, but you've come out to the Garden.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I've been saying that I'm going to fight the Hrad as a result of the Senate elections.
Later, I made it clear that if I was elected as a senator, I would run for the president.
My goal is, but it's not a function, it's a tool for how I can fulfill my vision.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.
But the trouble is not only that we as a nation are getting into a house and on TV, but that we're going to get everyone who wants to try to change.
This is added to the media that are denouncing people and that distort freedom of speech with freedom of speech.
I may have been told that I'm paying for the press or that I've been the advisor of Jiří Parouuk.
Let's go get your visa.
In the fight for the Garden, you have expressed the grave and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the return of property confessions of over 20 million.
You have to change the law to that.
But as president, you have no such authority and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I as a citizen lobbyed for leadership to be free of pleasure, it was a success.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good proposal to the left or the message, they approve of rejection, and it holds citizens back.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much more potential to get support from all the parliamentary parties.
My privilege is that without page-scaling and dogmat I can take something that is best for our country on each side and apply it.
You think you're more of a right-wing person or a left-wing person?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are taking me to the left.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little transport.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSCHM or the ODS, and I will be against the wrong idea anyway.
You're damned when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in the company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the ideas I'm talking about are already working in the world, or important experts have been talking about them.
But without Parliament's support, you'll only have passwords left.
And that's not what you're doing in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you follow people and talk to them, for example, you will be able to carry out a criminal and a serious responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convinced politicians, journalists and the public and trying to get them on our side in order to overcome it.
If I have been elected president, it is not a problem to arrange a direct television broadcast, where I ask the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to make a substantial and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and state representatives.
And they might have to tell us why they don't want her.
If there's a strong personality that's going to name crap, it can be pushed on a political scene.
Take the President's direct election, it was a public press privilege.
At the same time, I say I'm an amateur, I'm not a genius, I'm not an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to look for allies.
I've just started politics and I'll try to get most of my support for my program.
I'm trying to change things by myself, unless it goes away, in six years I'm going to end up and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything in one person, so I've been running a number of famous people to make sure they don't go to the Senate too.
I went after Radim Janchuru, who for the amount of work he refused.
At least that's how I supported the investigative journalist Jan Lorenzo, who was covering up frauds with light fuel oils.
I ran into people being really unhappy, but now I'm in trouble.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections, and those who went chose most of the representatives of the establishment.
We're only two independent in the Senate.
People called on the Senate to make changes difficult.
Still, I will fight for my vision, such as for the direct choice of the elderly or the hetman.
You're thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven't considered it yet, because I don't have time to check the pure past of every potential party, and I don't have any money on it.
I don't have any money on the presidential campaign, but on my transparent account, there's only 20,000.
You don't have the money?
You're talking about property confessions, what's yours?
I'm spending about 60 million on private property.
In Prague I have a land of about 25 million, an apartment of ten million, another apartment of eight million, a collection of works of art of about ten million, Aston Martin of 3.5 million, and Skodu Superb of a million, and then I have a few million in account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fighting against evil and evil.
You ride Aston Martin, you own 60 million and you don't have any money on the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not too convincing.
I don't have 15 million to campaign.
Is that what I'm supposed to do?
I've put 2.5 million to the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors is testifying that my program is probably not such an interest.
And I don't have to pay for my campaign.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover what I'm going to get the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't survive it, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school, which is 30 grand a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't give up anywhere.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd decide to do this?
But it doesn't matter how much you pay.
As I promised, I had a partial commitment to my activities.
For example, a travel agent will become my representative in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How many businessmen have you been used to taking a month?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I'm taking further.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
You will find the entire interview in the Saturday edition of the Law.
Architects MVRDV are proof that real adventures are not only in their head - for example, Spijkenisse and recently built Hora books - 2 pictures
"This building seems happy, it looks futuristic. Finally it is again to see something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig, who goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technology in a nearby big business, says, "However, this house is nice."
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and electronic books.
None of these old-fashioned books are ever going on today, right?
Spijkenisse, a location close to Rotterdam without its own work opportunities, which are not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This area of 80,000 inhabitants shows the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to solve this stupid situation, several years ago the decision fell to contribute to universal education and to build seven beautifully painted iron concrete miniatures of fictional bridges that are displayed on euro banknotes.
The success of the offensive education was not in vain.
And so the city councils realized that there is only one way to get the statistics: we must have a library!
Wine Maas from the Rotterdam architectural workshop MVRDV, a master of crazyly bold column charts and designer of funny, often even cynical buildings, took over the matter with normal calm and at the competition in 2003 he appeared with five books under the care and brilliance on his face.
And while the commission was still looking in awe at itself and shaking the shoulders, Maas poured out his gifts to himself according to size and his activistly reasoned speech ended the words "Dear City Village!"
So this is my proposal on the Horn of Books in Spijkenisse, so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, a 30m-euro mountain was designed.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarkets, mail and several adjacent residential and rowing houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, Hora was named the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
A small grass that could not yet offer more than a postmodern footing of the area and an unusually bad worker whose white façade you would rather expect milk, is richer than a bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
Long way to book
First impression: reader Eldorado under the roof of cheese.
By means of a massive mountain, however, you will discover the lift, but the real space and reading gestures until you walk down the topography.
From all sides, the lit interior is bright and transparent, the floors of the heated cab and elegant street lamps clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The city environment is perfect.
You see the park dolls, the dog and the boys and girls who play football.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"There are usually regulars with books along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark space, which is mostly insular and insatiable," says Winya Maas.
We set up a classic space configuration with legs up and space for the reader we moved out.
Interior Hory books are widely used: on Wednesday there are offices, Internet library, chess club, ecological center and central home techniques.
The special trip is black police on books that are once covered with walls, one parapet and the other on stairs.
Look, the structure and the smell affect the alien.
Over the unknown building material, the heads even attract architects and construction engineers.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, the project leader at the town council of Spijkenisse, on a standard issue.
And so one day in a French farm, we found a suitable agricultural waste product.
For many years it has been used as a base under the root of a millimetre of synthetic mass in glass and fields in the Netherlands.
It's cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile will last one, two seasons, and then it's mature to get rid of the bulk waste.
For the library it was run - first in such quantity - written on a four-centimeter fat board.
With the operation of the fire and pressure, the so-called Agricultural Plastic (CLP) will be coloured in dark, homogeneous and heavy material, which smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
You'll get to the top at 105 feet.
At the end of almost 500 meters of long journey you will be rewarded in the literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and figurines in flowering gardens.
They're looking for the atmosphere, but mostly for the correct humidity of the air in the top of the literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house is, despite many glass surfaces, a demonstration project on ecology," Trouborst says.
It melts and cools with earth’s heat.
Though the Mount of Books stands under a glass roof, the sun only shines in a short time, even in the sun's day.
The wide, beautiful wooden prisoners, which stand close to the open façade, serve as a protection and capture a large part of the sun’s rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest can handle fully automatic roles.
Stefan Spermon, an IT industry initial skeptic, has already visited the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig was there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, which Boekenberg even refers to as "the long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason: Each city resident was invited to open a book from his own personal fund a few weeks ago.
Thus, the first optical spaces were to be filled in so far, not entirely equipped library, which currently counts 70,000 pieces.
The concept was certified.
The cops are completely filled.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says the architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every citizen has a certain relationship with the new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if she was just in the mood.
This was done by MVRDV in the royal discipline, which is called the creation of identity in the professional jargon.
The story of the literature was written.
Whatever's young and uneducated.
That's finally the starting point for identity.
Shabo: "The Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in its decision to adopt Palestine.
According to U.S.-Europe relations expert Stephen Szaboa, Berlin is balancing on the narrow borders of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany was first signaling that it would vote against the proposal for the observer status of Palestinians in the United Nations.
Then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he supports the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting when it came to establishing a non-flight zone.
That's where NATO finally came in.
Is it difficult for Germany to understand a clear position on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is just changing its foreign policy, and that is the direction from the policy that has been the direction of the United States, towards the German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult than the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are between the two fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just staying in their role, but they're on their way to a "normal" foreign policy.
To the foreign policy they have in France or in the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean in German terms?
It shows willingness to take part in national interests and attitudes that are independent of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to some extent, different from the economic interests of other powers, and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and vote in the UN?
First, Germany has a large resort in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, he must be careful not to intimidate the public, but not elites in the Arab countries.
It plays a role anyway.
I don't want to attribute too much importance to this, it's not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, it plays a very important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States when, in the case of both important decisions, Germany abstained from voting, for example in voting on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States, there will be a great understanding of the German attitude.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as Libya's question.
I hope that Germany will even earn some respect.
This means that it must be considered as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S. has made this clear for the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American internal policy.
I think that Obama's government has probably a significant understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the darker political situation, this attitude cannot, of course, be stopped by the public.
I think the differences in opinions are really not as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all very excited about Netanyahu's policy.
Is it not difficult for Germany to introduce, in line with its close relationship with Israel and the United States on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for Germany if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not happening at this time.
So they can't be part of a wider line and they have to take things forward from their own position instead.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive topic.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play an independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a bigger role for this country.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, when Germany assumes a greater role, anti-German moods will arise.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It's an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable to the most diverse neighbors and opinions, and it's not easy.
The impact of the United States on European politics is constantly falling, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the present time.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even though they don't like it, they hate it and make it much more popular - c'est la vii!

"Save Tag" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
What about Armani Polo?
This is followed by a label that is officially registered in China, but has nothing in common with the original company.
However, it takes protection as long as it is not blamed by the actual owners of the mark.
And it's not even clear if the law is coming.
"It is increasingly difficult for a foreigner to protect his trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violating the rights of the Far East.
Every week, there's a new case coming up on my writing table.
A few more letters are needed to sign their badges.
From the Gucci brand, for example, Lu-Gucci will become and instead of Prada let Prada-Kny register.
In this way, German companies, like Puma’s sports product manufacturer, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens the order with the records of the Beijing Marking Office.
On September 14, 2010, she left a Chinese company to protect Zegna DF Puma’s brand. An artificial name that also parasitizes in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are the world's masters in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities there are several trading houses, where shoes are sold almost exclusively.
Pattloch's cases are different, however, because of its mandates it is against the fact that the Chinese companies have been given the right to use the label that has already been protected elsewhere from the flag office.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", the associated mark.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
That's what women who hunt rich men are talking about.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's damaging the trade, we have to torture it," Pattloch calls out.
"The hint is disbanded, the exceptional position disappears, the damage of the image is huge."
Financial losses and the costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially in expensive sample products.
According to data from CLSA, China is the third largest market in luxury goods and markets, with an amount of 15 billion euros per year.
However, a series of questionable records in the tag register can be difficult and something is worth it.
The operation can be extended to nine years, with the same result.
The Pattloch reports cases where the court dismissed the proceedings because the name was pronounced after a long period of "market reality".
When he has a complaining party, he still has to pay for the plague because he damaged his badge in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Known cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost the legal dispute with the manufacturer of Sany's construction machines, a company that recently took over the German manufacturer pumped into the Putzmeister concrete mixture.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue logo that reminded BMW. The track was balanced, Geely had to change the logo.
The fashion product manufacturer Lacoste lost in China with fans from Hong Kong and Singapore, who surrounded the known crocodiles in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
In 2010, the CTMO authorities admitted that there was a lack of staff and space due to too little staff.
But last year, it was supposed that "the process of work returned from the emergency situation to normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings fell by 22 per cent.
57 000 of these cases were closed, 75 per cent more than in the previous year.
Still waiting at the office for 81,500 complaints to be settled.
Something against it is expensive.
As is common in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China is set up to run a list of new applications around the world.
It also applies to the number of all the trademarks in force - it's a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were selected at the fees.
This simply means that each application is averaged at 1280 juan or 160 euros.
The beginning of this dispute is a few times as shown by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
This group has been fighting the Chinese plague for more than seven years.
The Germans have achieved the abolition of its illegal production of imitation car parts.
However, the facilitator secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand still.
We would like to remind ourselves of this because in Germany the names cannot be protected, says Hanna Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO's wife's office also rejected the opposition from the Munich company.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg gained the right, but the resistance in the dispute continues to fight today.
You need to be very careful.
Now the matter is discussed at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the matter will bring a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The drive is extremely expensive and it's worth a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs could not be calculated. In the company archive, they had to even look at hundreds of years of old records to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg, on the other hand, offered a "high six-digit amount in euros" in order to settle the dispute.
"You see what that means to us," says Wentzler.
He threatens to endanger Europe from the Far East as well.
And in case the copyists get unprotected marks there.
One Chinese producer, for example, wanted to sign a name Freudenberg for shoes and leather in Germany.
This area of business has long been abandoned by the group, but it has been able to refuse registration.
"It's important to be careful," says Wentzler.
He and the lawyer Pattloch advise the German companies to be very careful in dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Citizens should rather have "everything that stands for protection, even in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg, in the last story of his drama, is based on the brand, then it is likely that he will have to pay licensing fees on his own behalf, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World Day of Fighting AIDS: Jumping, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, Imbonga is being tested - and in Swaziland, the orphans are happy to see the parents who died of AIDS.
The story of a connection that goes far beyond 8733 kilometers.
First of all, there's a dive: cowboy high boots, basketball shoes, ladies' boats and ladies' mocasins are looking for a tat park and they're quick to find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers - altal, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly push, mom and each other to fight.
The 29-year-old director Fiete Hopfa almost lifts it from his textile shoes when he connects his voices with his hairy wild gestures.
It's Monday night. At the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Imbonga will try a new song.
There were 50 singers and singers between 23 and 69 years of age, from the researcher of human genetics to the household.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy composition, each congregation voice has a different text and also in a very foreign language - zulu, spoken to by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesothu, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Control Programme, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 orphans after parents who died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after the parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esiteni, the company Voices for Africa found patterns in Germany.
70 of them attend second grade school.
In 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take over the patronage.
Guarantees children school, school uniforms and one hot meal a day in the Gogo centre.
Imbongi means in the Zulu language "the editor of stories" or also "the one who worships".
No one can speak in this room, just sing.
For almost ten years he has been practicing the congregation in this foreign soft speech and sometimes he also brings them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, it is located in the northeastern part of the Soviet Empire of the village of Esiteni, which depends on the ability of the German congregation to vote.
Forty percent is infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some in simple clay or strawberries, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them don't have parents anymore, because they've been infected with HIV.
In Estonia it is seen in small, with the walls of the whole of Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
The population does not accept a male predisposition that manifestly reduces the risk of infection by half.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland are carrying a virus of weakened immunity in them, and there is no frequency that they die in the next thirty years.
This village was visited by the congregation on a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005. However, the members of Imbonga saw many children on the streets not only missing parental care, but quite everything: food, clothing, education.
Without completed education, there is no chance in the poor country.
At first, it was a private placement of individuals who, in a few euros a year, allowed the child to be sent to school and given him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, a group of the "Voices for Africa" group was established, which has been caring for orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPI belongs to syphilis, chlamydia and pectoris (gonorea).
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomavir, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Munjas and rhymes belong to parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the most affected group?
Syphilis and dog are especially common in men who have sex with men.
The Constitution of Robert Kocha is that at least four of the five cases of syphilids reported in Germany are sexually transmitted between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases often occur, Chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (nearness), dog and human papillomavir.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults among us, but about 20 percent of newly infected HIV belongs to this group.
Chlamydia infections are significantly more common among adolescents than among other population groups.
According to European research, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are common among young people.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
According to Robert Kocha, the number of syphilids infected in 2001 was more than doubled to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV-infected persons has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
It's about a decade less than a year ago.
What are the symptoms of sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may cause joints in the area of genitalia, difficulty in urticaria, rash, abdominal pain, or nipples.
Often, however, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms, so they will not be noticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Dangerous infections can reduce condoms, but they do not offer a degree of protection.
Because the causes of sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transmitted also infections from impurities and close physical contact.
This is why experts recommend regular examinations, particularly in the case of frequent sexual intercourse between partners.
In the case of timely diagnostics, it is possible to cure most SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, charitable gifts, and in the last series of honors, which the congregation makes singing throughout Germany, some money is collected.
"We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Estonia," said the president of the company Annette Lennartz.
Money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious woman who can be planted.
It also ensures that mature children find shelter, for example, in some grandmothers.
Gogo, as Zulu speaks to old women, are the resistance of the village.
Some of them also took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children were delivered to the school every day in uniforms.
Children who no longer have anyone are going to a shelter in Khanyisile, a lonely woman who pays for the same as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children a day.
"Voices for Africa" also founded a school of sewing, built two kurini and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged that many people in the village were allowed to perform a HIV test.
It's not obvious, even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone keeps quiet about it.
King to 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has something to do with sexuality."
In fact, it's quite strange in the country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his immeasurable lifestyle.
Let's compare democracy.
This country's approved way of life is also responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in the past decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
Culture is a different - unprotected link."
To at least support cultural exchange, the Imbongi Congregation travels once in two, three years together in South Africa and sings songs full of grief, fighting, confidence in the future and self-conscious blacks, many in the southern tip of the Black continent have known since the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of the blacks - such appreciation brings not only the mood and joy but also the tears of many wild foreign soldiers.
The road always leads to Estonia, where singers visit children who have patrons over them.
Although this village is hard to find on the maps, in the valley of the river Eulweni is more than known.
"Go to Estonia, there's light," people say.
And when you get back to Heidelberg, which is an air charm of 8733 kilometers away, to the dumb singers in the experiment at Bergheimer Straße, you can see that light shines here too.
Messenger: NASA discovered on Mercury ice
The probe Messenger found evidence that there's ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The US National Aviation and Cosmonautique Authority (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although close to the Sun, there is also frozen water as it emerges from three studies that published the "Science" expert magazine on Thursday.
The probe Messenger found evidence that there is an ice cover in the area of this planet, which lies in the lasting shadow.
It's probably at least 30 centimeters and maybe up to 20 meters strong.
This water came according to everything from the comet or perhaps even from the asteroids that attacked Mercury.
But let's not find the ice in relation to the existence of life on this planet, said leading scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us to explain how water and other basic elements of life have been found in other areas of the solar system.
The probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, the undetected earth, are involved in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they're going to Earth's images, a small window to endless distances.
The image comes from a photographic device that developed German scientists from the Maxe Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides the dark planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which is crossing Neptune around the Sun, Ceres is not, according to the new definition of the 2006 "planet" International Astronomical Union.
This cross-section of the infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows the "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, worse identifiable are pink coloured "new-born" on the birth room of the stars.
This area, where stars form - scientists call it the W5 unromantic - discovered Spitzer's telescope in the Cassiopeia constellation at the distance of 6500 light years.
This changing game of dying stars caught Spitzer's NASA telescope.
A powerful ring consists of a material that the star destroyed during the process of dying.
In the giant trifid mill, which is 5400 light-years away from the Earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
The photo of the galactic "colleagues" was directed by the NASA Spitzer telescope.
The Pleiade Star, also called "Seven Sister", is only seen in the night.
Thanks to the telescope, however, the colors are better.
Mlovina Helix may look like a red eye on this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light-years from the water star.
Its similarity to the Earthquake has produced this millennia of the name North America.
The combination of normal and infra-red photography is the origin of unusual coloration.
This "minimum" between the stars has been able to shoot in the full beauty until the infrared detectors of Spitzer's telescope.
Saturn and his rings: how they came up is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
I hope it's about the remains of Saturn's moons, which, 4.5 billion years ago, disappeared without any trace.
One of the biggest and most outstanding images of Hubble's telescope: faith galaxy
The images of the spiral galaxies, according to their coloring, become real artistic parts.
The exhibition published by the European Southern Observer shows a few thousand light-years away from the Trifid mill in the constellation of the Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triangular) because the dark dust channels share the burning heart of this star birth on three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonos, astronomers photographed the presence of a cosmic crash: at 400 million light-years from Earth, the core of two successive galaxies is on the ground and must inevitably come to the wheel.
This creation of the star recorded Hubble's telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical shorts can call it the South Windmill.
Photo from Hubble's space-wide view shows the intersection of the Iris mill in the Cefea constellation.
These 1400 light years are made up of dust grains, which are ten times as much as a hundred times as the usual domestic dust.
This image was composed of optical and x-ray images of different telescopes.
It displays a ring of black holes, which is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, recorded Hubble's cosmic remote view of NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star mill there is the clearest group of young stars in our Milky Ways.
The collaborator of the star gives rise to new growths.
This star cloud, also associated with the Rosette mill, still produces new young stars. They are 5,000 light years away from Earth.
In this clear star galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was only a short time after the Great Depression when it was mostly hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our views of space: the most important telescopes
The remote view was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Even before Galileo, he later used it to observe the stars.
Since then, optical remote views have been increasing - and the perspectives that mediate are getting deeper.
The world’s largest remote sight was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale’s telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror on this picture had a diameter of five meters.
There's a big binocular telescope in the American Arizona.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
Inside Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures an average of 10.4 metres.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to offset costs.
Yet its diameter reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the cheap design: the telescope is secured by the hog in the high angle, thus limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the high angle.
His specialty is a high-strengthening of the light stream.
Despite a relatively small average of mirrors, this is equal to the world's largest spectacular remote views.
Radiotelescopes in Arecibu (Portorico) help the scientists in space search for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has an average of 305 metres.
At "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - searching for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who provides its computational performance.
Look at the observatory of the European Southern Observer (ESO) in the Chilean Andeans.
It stands here very Large Telescope - and honors its name.
This distance with a total of four mirrors can also brighten the average infrared spectrum.
The European extremely wide range is also planned for the Chilean ESO observers.
Its main mirror shall be full of 42 meters and shall be composed of nearly 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be counted first in 2018.
Two Keckov's remote views of Mauna Kea's Hawaiian soup were considered the largest in the world by 2007.
They're offering two mirrors, each with an average of ten meters.
Keckov's remote views are part of Mauna Kea's observatories, who, in addition to them, watch the universe and use the telescope Subaru and IRTTF.
Also on Mauna Kea is to create a new large telescope - with a diameter of 30-inch mirror.
Here you can admire her on the picture.
However, the most important impressions from the universe mediate Hubble's cosmic remote view.
The celebrations of the distant world have been ours since 24 April 1990.
Kepler's space telescope dates back to March 2009 after extrasolar planets - especially after those that are inhabited.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been identified from the beginning of the mission.
The image contains the last preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
Space remote view James Webba (JWST) will be shot first in 2018 into space on the Ariane missile deck.
The primary mirror of the infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to seek the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Great Depression.
Scientists are based on the fact that there's ice on the south of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this because the Messenger is crossing this planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent in 2004 and is the first to be around Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter every day and live for 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will have a Bible - based life.

In southern Azerbaijan, many people will have a Bible - based life.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for a trail in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
I'm gonna go upstairs and call Talysh a romantic savage.
The microbus of counting along the road with many stops along densely forested hills, the ancient rivers and the plains of the village.
It's all green and green, almost like we're in Schwarzwald.
However, this one is the closest one to Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here is a Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh, which is not known to much, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and are living at a very high age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town boasts too much monumental architecture from the Soviet times, which does not seem to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe don't come here. Coming from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too easy.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-way.
The historic wealth for which the country thanks oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the countryside.
However, Pilate Fatulajeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
"The Grand Pricing of Eurovision celebrated Grandma in May - and we will have the oldest festival in the world next year," Fatulayeva says.
He's the director of a long-lasting museum, probably the only one in the world.
The life of almost eight Tuts of the Talysh from the area is documented here, which are hundreds of years old. Fatulayeva shows black-white photos.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still had a baby.
However, this museum’s controversial star is the shepherd of the sheep of Şarali Müslümov, which was reportedly 168 years old.
There is, however, no birth certificate.
And since the oldest person with the evidence was 122 years old, the age of Islam seems to be quite doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and in 1973 he died," Fatulayeva explains.
This man was supposed to be married three times and he had 23 children.
So Şarali muslumov was not mistaken in his age for a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist of the Maxe Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about the flying people in Central Asia.
"Perhaps many people of high age live in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also lives in Sardinia very many very old men."
No scientific evidence of age, however, is available due to the lack of evidence, especially when the matrix is missing.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
The fact is, though, that people in the area around Leric have a great deal of experience in Bible age.
There are currently 20 people who are 100 years of age.
So why does he live here on the south of so many flying people?
Azerbaijan's leader Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the Talysh.
The director of Fatul's museum believes it's in the food.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of the Talyshes, who love meat, bread and especially milk products, and many of which drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, from a bromatological point of view, does not seem quite reliable.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, the village of Rubab Mirzajev.
She is still relatively young at 97 years of age.
Mirzajev, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasian region.
He's sitting on the ground with a blender that he's not legally collaborating.
Under one roof, eight people live here, besides one of the sons of Mirza's and the daughter's, both of whom are fathers long ago.
There's two little kids jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is given in typical "armada" crystals.
The white teeth of Mirza's make a perfect order and under the coat conceals a long dark blonde copies that proudly exposes her son to us.
I always missed my hair with milk, so they didn't look like me and they kept their color.
"That's the way I've never used shampoo," Mirzayev says.
The monthly income for life is enough
She always ate only what came out of her own palace, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
For the rest of my life, I never bought food in a supermarket once.
Then he'll tell me about his man who was in the army.
The worst was the second world war.
But it all improved when the village took over the "loved father" Geidar Ali's.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the cult that is taking place around the position of the father of the nations, who ruled his country as dictator, does not know the boundaries of Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then took over his son Ilham.
Old people in Azerbaijan at least don't have to suffer.
Mirzajeva receives a salary of 230 manats each month (approximately the same amount in euros). This is the amount from which you can benefit.
And maybe he has the truth of a long time ago, Mirza's son, who says, "The old people are very serious in our culture."
They live in the middle of a large family, are loved, cared for, and happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "lyid law" in the constitution is missing
The revolution has returned to Kahiry.
The deliberate demonstrations in Cairo have revealed a deep dispersal of the country.
A strong debate is being held on the future constitution based on the law of the Sharia.
The president of Egypt didn't run a path.
We need to create a transition.
"And for our success, I am responsible, before men and before God," he said on state television.
His word was directed to the whole nation, especially to the Christian Coptics, the liberals, the glorified Muslims, and the secular people.
All those hopelessly disappointed in the confused opposition, that's why they're afraid.
Fear of "the state of God" on the Nile for the grace of a powerful Muslim brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursí almost politely announced that he had transitionally restricted the competence of the Constitutional Court and extended his own to "save the revolution".
However, what a 61-year-old engineer who has the title of a doctor of the American University in southern California really wants to save, is that the Egyptians have no clear world.
Is it supposed to be out of power?
234 paragraphs, which were soon approved by the President of the Constitutional Assembly with the influence of the Islamists in the 15th watch of the night marathon, are partly concerned.
As in previous institutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principals" mean?
It was and is a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that the Islamics use this vague formula and the associated legal free space for closer interpretation of the Sharia.
At least this highlights the new paragraph added: In all matters relating to the Sharia, it is necessary to consult al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on the whole of Sunni Islam.
It doesn't have to, but it can mean that the chlorine will be supervised by the law, which would bring the justice to the actual exercise of discretion.
In the draft constitution there are many things of interpretation
The problem is also that civil jurisdiction of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served as Mubara's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As proposed, it should also protect "the right of the Egyptian family and support its morals and values".
This has been so accurately formulated that by means of this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In a understandable word, it means nothing but censorship.
No other paragraph shall, in writing, determine the explicit equality between men and women.
Therefore, another paragraph prohibits the hanobite or slander of the prophet Mohammed and his envoy.
But there is a lack of clarity as to what is disgrace and how it will be achieved.
There is no doubt, however, that the wording is not "impossible".
In this case, is the president's cartoon or a joke on the law book?
The matter of interpretation, like many others in this proposal, which Mursí proposes to sign, and according to his words, it will be "very soon" to present to the Egyptians for the purpose of a human vote.
"The revolution has returned"
For a few weeks, opposition to the movement of Islamists has been formed.
Tens of thousands of people gathered at Tahrír Square in Kahir on Friday night and pledged to destroy the constitutional code before they started paying.
"The revolution has returned and we win," said Hamdín Sabbáhi, who was placed in the third place in presidential elections.
The Nobel Prize bearer and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradej, announced that the proposal of the constitution belonged to "the waste of history".
Through the short news service, Twitter has accused Murssi's propriety that they want to carry out "a street against democracy".
"If he issues a referendum, we will go to his palace and drop it," said opposition member Jásir Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not persecuted," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition policy of Chalda Ali.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to attend a referendum, which would make it inappropriate.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood issued a horrific demonstration, but not in Tahrír Square, but after a collective prayer on the other bank of Nile before the Kahir University.
She was attended by many interested women and supporters of the Salafists who called out: "People demand the application of God's law."
They called out to him, "Exalted are the people of the land!" and they said, "Ours is the Quran."
The struggle for superiority over the symbolic hire of Tahrír, in which everything began to take place, is likely to bring about a situation similar to that of civil war.
Mursy's proponents obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that the opposition and opposition of the draft constitution were loud and clear.
Now is the time to let people in the election hours decide which way the country should go.
Most of them are considered to be in favour of the Islamic proposal.
"The word 'lyid law' doesn't exist at all"
The instigated constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is the anniversary of the Hafiza Abu Sa'du.
Eighty-four years human rights defenders and the president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison for Mubarak or standing before the court.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are inseparable for him.
He was beaten, sentenced and imprisoned for that.
"And in the new constitution now there are no 'lyid law' words ever," she complains in a conversation for 'Welt am Sonntag'.
The Mursi extension of power to all three powerful components in the state has led this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous violation of the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"In a place where the president of civil society has been forced, he has actually destroyed it," says Sa'da.
However, democracy cannot function without the organization of civil society.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, which is following the battle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mix of consciousness and tension.
That could be his fault.
Demonstrant at Tahrír Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can't control anymore."
Norwegian Cancer: The world's most exciting fish?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the local appetite for extraordinarily smelling fish?
Take a few mature cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football equipment.
Let it lie down for a week.
So you'll get some paralysing smells of cancer, one of the biggest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's a snowy, beautiful view - and in the air it's hanging all over the air.
Rakfisk is a wet pustrum boiled in water for up to one year - depends on how much you want the fish to swallow.
As it gets cold and starts to cool, the Norwegians here in Fagernes are starting to meet the festival dedicated to this, as they say, the best, most subhuman food.
"You make it raw and then drink a glass of water," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional fireman, but also called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the course of the festival.
People around us eat small pieces of fish and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
"Some people have better aqueducts than crabs," says Havard.
The drink can break the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's a similar piece of sushi that was on a long way by bus.
Cancer is a product of a very different age when there was poverty in Norway, and since there were no ice creams yet, fish in the autumn flocked to the air-conditioning courts with water and salt.
Then in the middle of the winter, when they were well shaken, they drew out and ate - the senses of no doubt melted with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Nora were forced to leave their country and look for work, most of which they emigrated to the United States.
At the present time, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants are creating a bond with a large amount of work, a high cost and a large care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival, who had been far richer than Norway recently, are going to the country for work.
It is considered to be an important, irrevocable part of the Norwegian past, even though it is a relatively inflammable part of the Norwegian past.
It's amongst the expensive food on the market.
Although expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or sandwich will take you out to 9 pounds (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway often fails to reach world news - and it seems that most people do.
The name Anderse Breivika, a rights-based racist extremist, who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned here with neglect.
Instead, the shooting is called "the escape of July 22nd."
The Norwegians can only hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Despite the current wealth, Norway is one of the largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970 ’ s.
"But the oil is not the only reason why it works so well for us," says our lady Anna, who with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes represents a prototype of the Nordic welfare.
We're, like you're told, people are going to be serious.
Her English, as well as the English of most of the people here, is quite unusual.
We don't pretend, we don't like the occasion.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - except for a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for the future generation.
When all the others in the years leading up to the global financial crisis spread money that they did not have, the Norns had a tight grip on their town.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go on summer trips, we're happy," Anna says.
"And eating crabs," he adds with an unannounced smile.
I'm standing in the snow in the front for something to eat - cancer is enough.
Such a poor burger is definitely something else and he's pretty neat.
But tonight, there's a burning fish here again.
The hotel in which I live is one of many places where cancer is administered for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the coolest fish.
They have this connection to live television transmission, in which the moderator is with the mollusk-covered plates with the cancer.
It's like a singing Eurovision competition.
"What's your score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here's our punctuation, Havard."
It's called humiliation and laughter.
A man may fall from a chair, perhaps with an aquarium.
Or maybe all those fish escapes.
Enrique Pena Neto from Mexico has a hard start
As the upcoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto prepares to take over the office, he considers Will Grant from the BBC the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transport in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is trapped even in the best times, steel barriers were raised that closed several key routes into the main city and caused road chaos.
The aim, however, was not to prevent entry into work, but to prevent the protesting in approach to Parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico Enrique Pena Neto will receive the president's scarf and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's in charge.
Mexico was a good economic leader at the time of the departure of Felipe Calderon, but the country was in the war camps of drugs, which had already taken over 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment towards the Mexican people in reducing violence," said President Pena Neto to American President Barack Obama at the Oval Workshop at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before he broke his hand with the U.S. president, President Pena Neta gained political experience as governor of her home state in Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, a smooth and spacious state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, they remember him in a good way.
Citizens attribute to him the development of tourism in aviation and the construction of infrastructure.
Now you can reach the city after one of the new roads that allowed Pena Neto to build. These roads are a huge improvement against the holes and crowded roads that were here before.
The board with its name also hangs on the walls of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with a theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring about a real and lasting change," says a friend and political associate Gabriel Olver Hernandez, a state MP by President Pen Nieta, the institutionalized revolution (PRI) party.
In particular, we look forward to interesting and real changes in the security and economy that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of uninterrupted power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicente Fox.
Ambassador Olver admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, many are expected to be inside of Enriqua Pena Nieta.
And he rejects the statement of opposition that characterizes the new president as a human being without material content.
He's a very direct man, very busy with the excellent vision of the earth.
He's a great citizen, and he's mostly a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezaalcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the long streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Congested under road traffic in many places, the suburb of Mexico is the main city itself.
And problems in the self-righteous community are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, an army was called to help with the control of drug gangs operating in the quarters, especially the armed forces are violence against women.
Only in the last two years have there been a huge waste pool in the empty areas of the body of the victims.
In Mexico, more than 1,000 women were murdered at the time of Pena Nieto’s reign, much more than in the notorious violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a place that is synonymous with the killing of innocent women.
In a better case, Pena Nieta's critic says that when she acted in the office, she failed to deal with the problem of women's murder.
And in the worst case of his leadership, they blame him for closing their eyes.
In the concrete house, typical of the busted quarter, Irinea Buendia shows me pictures of her dead daughter Mariana Luny and suppresses the crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if her body were wrong," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of strokes on him, and she's already starting to die.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is the only word: "Justice".
However, this is what the family says, exactly what they were denied.
State authorities treated me as if I were an old dreary, a troublemaker and a nun.
They want you to just accept what they say and shut up.
"But it can't be right when there's so many mistakes and reminders," he says.
The Sherpa, who President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been attacked by a violent crime and the new president has promised to be his priority after his office.
"I hope that he will be the same president as he was governor," said PRI Olver in Valle del Bravo.
But that's exactly what families in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about the wrong conduct, the military prosecutor said.
The military prosecutor is trying to break Bradley Manning's claim regarding harsh conduct in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants the case to be rejected on the basis of harsh treatment with Manning in prison.
The military is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that the soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest failure of secret material in the history of the United States, has missed many opportunities to complain about the brutal treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military Prosecutor May. Ashden Fein at the cross-examination of the Manning military during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Maede in Maryland claimed that the records of weekly visits that Manning had with the unit officials during the nine months of Quantic in Virginia show no complaints of maltreatment.
The cross-examination that occurred during the hearing of the defence proposal to refuse the case brought against Manning for the sake of cruel treatment during the time of the imprisonment, which is itself sufficient to punish, took place the day after Manning testified that he considered suicide in the prison.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents in his service in Iraq.
Material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
On Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein passed along with Manning's form, which the officers completed after meeting Manning in Quantica prison, where he was held in custody from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday on these forms, Manning admitted that the behavior of his guards was "excellent" and the overall behavior in the device was "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints of maltreatment, even though officials of Manning directly asked how they were treated with it, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that concerns about various problems had been voiced and that the officials who visited him had talked to him about these concerns and indicated that they would be dealt with, but these problems had not been recorded.
"They wrote "no problems" (after the concerns were debated), and it didn't necessarily mean that I didn't mention them," said Manning.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about dealing with his person in January 2011 when he met with the commission of suicide, which he said several months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting it was his intention to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injury" regime.
The army stated that it had used this restrictive regime (one level under the suicide surveillance regime) for its protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this system of prevention of injury... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transport to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transported to the prison on basic maritime voyages in Quantica, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait, and once there, for a reason, he was so hot.
He stated that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what would happen to him in the surrounding world was very interesting.
"My world only crashed on the foundation of Arifján, on the corner," said Manning Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning stated that after arriving in Quantica he spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small target without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one mattress, a blanket, a phone call, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleep or just lying was in the course of the day against the rules.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He stated that if the guards could not see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's legal representative filed a formal complaint in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to the military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked for an accusation he made in a quarterly statement regarding that after having been forced to sleep one night in his quest for Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other communities at the time of his calculations.
Manning said he was not allowed to hide his cover when counting.
On Friday's hearing, Judge Manning stated that by order of his guards, he had decided that he had a cover that could be hidden, but he admitted that no one had issued an order for her to be postponed.
On Thursday Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said the officer said he could use a belt from his underwear or his phone calls to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning said that his underwear, his phone rings and glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His legal representative hopes that the judge will take into account his experience of his imprisonment and that in the case of his testimony before the military court, whose beginning is expected at the beginning of next year, his punishment will be significantly reduced.
The defence stated that Manning is planning to admit himself to guilt in lower crimes and that he will fight against other charges because they are too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, and the military prosecutor is expected to defend the conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon stated that Manning was kept in accordance with the provisions concerning all prisoners in charge of maximum alert.
The charges brought against Manning include the assistance of the enemy, the unlawful cause of the publication of reporting documents on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national security and the theft of public property or records.
If he is accused at all points, he may be held liable for life.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says that many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the inadequate possibilities there are.
Mexicans are willing to blame those who have left; they are reminded of the hard times, he says.
Navarrette says the Mexican Americans are greedy between the two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital city of Mexico, I almost broke up with a crowd and arrived in the area for the immigrant agenda, where I encountered a problem.
The spikes pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Citizens").
I stood there for a few seconds and didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life was called "Mexico."
It's an ethnic shortcut, just like when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
So I ended up with the name "Mexico American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, it wasn't necessary to use shorts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, quite well for me to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have the word resources of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out my American belt and set up a front for "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment when this week, newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto visited the White House of President Obama.
The programme had common issues to be discussed when the leaders of the two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Neto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is as likely that Mexicans will remain in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
He wants to connect with the United States and Canada and create a business block similar to that of the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue in the Mexican war against drug cartels, even if he didn't provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and forced its leader under threat to re-write half of the Mexican territory to the United States.
But for the Mexicans who think about the age range, not a minute, the memories are everywhere.
So a minute after the United States representative says something a little critical about Mexico, you hear in the Mexican press and between the elite complaint about how Americans intervene in the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And Montezumi's kids are going on a war track.
Yet, for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico there are winners and defeats, people that the country offers opportunities, and others that don't.
The only reason that so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point of our family tree, there was a person, perhaps a parent, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person corresponded to the profile - dark skin, poor education, the origin of the poor village, etc.
We're their descendants and we're loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even if we're living American dreams now, going to good schools and having a good job, we can never forget that we're living American dreams, not Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
He's in front of the United States.
And yet we realize that many elite Mexicans in the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and view us as a sub-racial race that is not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our journey to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is based on their view of failure.
If our families didn't move to Mexico, they'd never leave her.
And we would now not be trapped in a snowflake, with a good life in the United States, but with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and when she was legalized in the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans understand more who they are, and Mexican Americans don't.
Although he is a citizen of the United States, he sees himself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, a lot of Mexican Americans I know don't feel like part or part of it.
We love the audience of the Mexican groups, Los Tigers del Norte, but also Bruce Springstone.
You'll get the best of both countries, but you don't even have roots in one.
In Mexico, he looks at us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to re-connect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American partners how great it is to visit this country and press on the political leader to establish relations with Mexico.
No, no.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And because of the inequality of income and widespread corruption and drug abuse, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I feel like it's on you, my friends.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States as they dealt with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel bad about how their family members were treated in a much closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be an unmistakable foundation for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood flow cycle indicates that each of these events is fatal.
Among the usual remaining hints about who started this, many buildings were turned into riots, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most civilians, and six Israelis. And first came rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though it seems that the Israelis and the Palestinians have been trapped in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are trapped in the resulting chaos in the region.
Maybe it'll make their fight even more bloody than ever.
However, there is reason to believe that it can disrupt their mortal condition.
A war that is neither saved nor saved.
At first glance, there seems to be not many reasons for optimism at the present time.
Even if the stop of the fire closed on November 21st lasted, the fights of this week strengthened the mine on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamic movement, which has ruled in Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelites to resign, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the closure of 1.7 million people in Gaza in one of the most sad and saddest corners of the planet, Hamas did not succeed in destroying Israel.
And indeed, Hamás is influenced by the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his busy rivals from Fatah, the calmest Palestinian fraction.
Furthermore, the leaders of Hamas can very well determine that time is on their side.
Islamists all over the Arab world gained greater influence, so Hamas gained powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, the revitalized regional power, which was once the closest Muslim associate of Israel, joined Hamas. Likewise, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Fascinating Hamas people say that the Islamic half-month is surrounded by Israel, north of Lebanon, where the ruling party/military Hizballah, across Syria, where rebels, who are still more inclined to Islam, can sit in Bashar Asad, after Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the kings.
Above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt has changed, far from being the southernmost and most difficult Arab country, to the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular depot that ruled in Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is the brotherhood of Hamas and its leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy Hamas can be found as a player who cannot be excluded by Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israel’s insistent leaders will come to the opposite conclusions.
Hamas was put back in his military terminology.
The Israeli missile system The Iron Cup proved its price and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelites can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as invincible as ever. Many European countries have also vinyl Hamas since the beginning of the last round of violence.
And most of all, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahua, the president of the government, who ignored the peace process most of them.
Even though rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively calm against suicide bombers, from the part of the wall, which covers the West Bank, the main part of what the Palestinian state may once be, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite its illegality against international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose side of Likud, at the beginning of the campaign, joined the even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why should we crush those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled on the West Coast, wouldn't they fire rockets like their countrymen in Gaza?
It'll be better if we keep them behind that wall and we hit them when they blow their heads out.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line win, but the Arab yoke can change their props.
Although the Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not have Israel too much in love, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defence expenditure is higher than the expenditure of all its four Arab neighbours together.
The start of a new war with local superpowers will hardly help the new Arab government heal its economy.
The fact that President Mursí was working with President Barack Obama to get a fire stop is a good sign and can mean the beginning of something new.
The Israelites too should look at this situation from a long - term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates opposition to the Palestinians' right to self-determination of the court with the shooting work that one day must explode in the areas occupied by Israel - as well as the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already, repression in the Jewish state of democracy and demographics are weakening this situation as the Arab population is growing.
Blood spills against Gaza, which take every few years for the purpose of pressing Hamas, will continue to choose a diplomatic tax.
Both sides need calls outside.
The answer is what reasonable people say on both sides, most of the outside world and these newspapers: two states, when Israel comes out for security reasons.
In the short term, there is a little hope that stopping the fire will give the outside pressure at least a little more influence on the release of this thing.
Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar must establish a ceasefire in the supply of weapons to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arab neighbors must also press for a deal between Hamas and Fatah.
This would have done more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations for the creation of a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has his part in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first election period, he neglected the presentation of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems to be equally vulnerable in his entry into the process.
It's a sad short-haired thing.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, there came into force of the Law on Cruel Cigarettes
In regardless of the green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, warning is displayed for chickens and sick parts of the body.
In force, Australian laws on the gross packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their kind in the world, and logos and colors replaced the common olive-green boxes with vivid images of the sick parts of the body, and the display of children and newborns who are ill because of the smoking of their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and pictures, the only difference between boxes between the name of the label and the same small letter is required from Saturday.
It's the most expensive regime in the world with regard to tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the aim is to get young people out of smoking by avoiding this abuse.
It depends on a study that shows that if people do not start smoking at the age of 26, it is 99% chance that they will never start smoking.
"Even in very young children you can see that they understand a message that tobacco companies are trying to sell together with their product," says the Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek and quoted a study that showed, for example, that children connect a crown in a window with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of chickens in the world and changes will only have a small impact on the profits of transnational companies, other countries consider the introduction of similar measures.
The tobacco industry strongly opposed the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase trade on the black market, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"Thanks to this legislation, there are serious unimaginable consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
The victims of China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trades.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarette packaging from silicone used to cover non-lethal boxes, two months ago, when British American tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco had lost its appeal to the Australian Supreme Court laws, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha stated that Zico sold almost 6,000 pieces to wholesalers and expected new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As possible, experts indicate the popularity of social media in the demographic group to which the plan is aimed.
Throughout a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sports events and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes directly, tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has banned internet advertising carried out by local companies and websites, but it cannot limit foreign sites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and only you are left with this small space for the promotion of your products, the online space for you is an insurmountable place where you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a research firm in public health at Sydney University.
Mrs. Freeman recorded an increase in the rating of social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, performed by "average Honzou".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and gave his job here and created this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the sector has focused on how it invests in new regulations rather than on marketing.
The sector has gone so far that Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic have paid for the attacks on new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organisation declare that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly trades.
The adoption of the SOO Decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government has been conducting discussions with other governments that consider similar laws relating to packaging.
Canada was the first country to take mandatory security photographs in 2001.
Now more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine, have expanded.
More stringent laws are being considered by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the Republic of South Africa and India.
A lot of chickens in Australia are coming up.
The images have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You'll just pull out a cigarette and pull the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photo of the tumor in your mouth.
Frankly, there's only one reason I quit smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, claims that thanks to the single box it is harder for him to balance it to the rules.
"It took me an hour, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, "Okay, that's the end, we'll close the house," he said and decided with his hands.
It's not so bad to be bored in a world of unsatisfying connections
The last day of Thanksgiving, I spent an unexpected five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time to think about the nude.
I won't lie to you.
Waiting for a half day at the airport for another flight is quite boring, even through the dispersal of books, magazines and iPhones (not talking about duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly coming with the praise of boredom.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting ways, which can support creation.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen today, we have no chance to enjoy it.
So should we support the nude?
Yes.
Oh, no.
But I'll be back.
For the first time, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that came with more free time.
But as Peter Toohey says, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of the book Bored: A Livey History (History nudy) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, the boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found a Latin inscription regarding the nude, from the first century C.E.
And then there's also a question of how we define nude.
The problem is that it was defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the research literature and presenting the idea of the target group, some 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues, defined boredom as the experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to do it."
Nudity differs from apathy because a person is not involved in anything, but she wants to be.
He says there's no need to do anything in the pharmacy.
He says that the core of the nude is "a failure of the process of attention linked to the bad mood and the feeling of slow running time."
Nuda can remember much of the depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship, people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to a previous experiment, where participants listened to the tape on which the person read the article from the magazine.
Some groups heard loud and unrelated television programs in the next room, others heard her quietly, and hardly noticed her, while the third group did not hear her at all.
Those who heard the television program of peace reported more nausea than the other two groups - had problems with focus, but were not sure why and attributed these problems to nausea.
If you are trying to focus on a difficult or restless task, the interruption of attention may lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "as it's looking for bad parts on the factory line, it can be an exciting music to help you not to be bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that bending and squeezing, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help to fight and keep people physically more focused.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to go around will learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit down in peace," said Professor Fenske.
We've all been bored at times - late for my flight, a crying player, especially a long movie.
But some individuals are more likely to be bored than others.
In the 1980s, scientists developed "Bordom Proneness Scale" to help measure nausea.
Steps include questions such as: "Many things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous," and "I'm so interested that I don't have time to do them all."
With these degrees, scientists have found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulation.
However, teenagers are generally invalid.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of the teenagers said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he doesn't know if the percentage statement of nausea would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
He said, however, that he knows that "growth is the ultimate time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is it good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take the absurd physical risks, play gambling, or abuse conventional substances as a way to mitigate them.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between nudity and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"There's a way to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing you should do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy just for a moment, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to play himself or drive on his own, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child not only learns how to enjoy himself, but gets more self - control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate the nude.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her.
Our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are on the verge of a continuous breakup of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We blame her for the need to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected with something meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for, he said is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly understimulating," he said, "it's hard to find ways to have fun when the noise turns off."
In Colorado, there is no manual on a new marijuana law.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at a university and a footballer from South-East Colorado, faces a charge of criminal acts for something that will soon be legal in the whole state - for holding several grams of marijuana and smokes that he used to smoke.
Mr. Orozco said that one January day he went with a few friends in Lamar, on the banks near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After a police officer found in a marijuana car, Mr. Orozco was given a call for the detention of drugs and equipment for the use of drugs - small offences, with a penalty of USD 100 - and a court date was set for him.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In the early weeks after the vote on the legalisation of a small quantity of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends more on the place than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of violations of marijuana detention have already been here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures, have been abolished.
The police department has stopped accusing adults aged 21 and older for holding a small quantity, which will be legally allowed after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But the plaintiffs in the more conservative districts of Colorado have declared that they will continue with existing cases of marijuana, and they still accuse people of holding.
At the same time, several cities from Denver towards the western mountains vote to prevent the opening of new, licensed shops with marijuana in their villages.
"This issue is developing so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The head of the tree and the regulators in the state of Washington.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a system of licences for growth, production, distribution and sale - all by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, either in good or in bad, is in front of most states in marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it's going to be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a speech counselor for licensing the state of Washington.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than propose what might work.
"There is no real precedent that we could drive," he said.
Washington law, i.e. I-502, has effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum, during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal detention yes.
And there are urgent mechanical questions that have to be resolved during this period, such as how to implement the State directive on "relevant approach" to licensed marijuana with its ban on trade with a rope up to 330 metres from schools, parks, children's toys or child's centres.
"Nothing will be more difficult to place a licensed trade with a rope than in the urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson of the Centre for Legal Coupons, recently founded research groups.
On 21 November, police chief Oates sent an e-mail to his officers in Aurora, informing them that the city prosecutors will no longer be indicted for holding a small quantity of marijuana in every citizen of 21 years old and that the police "with immediate validity" will stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police would promote city laws governing drug growers and that they would continue to beat drug dealers and dealers.
In the period Weld in North Colorado, the periodic prosecutor Ken Buck is a stronger view.
After the vote, he announced that his office would continue in the process of maintaining marijuana, mostly as a way of pressing users to seek treatment.
Currently, there are 56 grams or less of marijuana in charge of 119 people, although many of them face further accusations.
"Our office is obliged to file a criminal offence, which was a criminal offence at the time it came to them," Mr Buck stated in his statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places such as the rural period of Mass, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the period, no longer blames adults for holding a small amount.
The District Prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to refuse all pending detention cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of the colourful wishes of the measures have supported, the introduction of recreational marijuana into the government's hands and the legal system will never be easy.
In view of this large state green experiment, the reaction to the opposition to the state revealed deep dispersal among local officials.
For periodic prosecutors, it is a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, representing the accused of holding marijuana, and local speakers of the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana Laws.
"They spent so much of their lives earning people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to build small quantities of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best way to become national testing cases for drug law.
Guardians and state authorities are planning new limits for legalised sales and are also looking forward to the federal government's guidelines, which are still planned to consider the sale and growth of marijuana for federal crimes.
The legalisation advocates of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will be denied.
Despite several arrests by marijuana salesmen for medical purposes and patients who use it, which attracted attention, the federal government left most of the trades with marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries in operation.
While anti-drug agents are probably not going to challenge the door to capture a small drug bag, it is likely that they will be able to compete with the state-regulated state-run businesses with recreational marijuana permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former adviser in the area of the anti-drug policy of President Obama's administration.
A number of colorful cities do not await the procedure of the federal authorities.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums for any new marijuana stores, even though it would take about a year before any trade can be opened.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a half-year ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where we're giving someone a license and then we're going to have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our brother voted against that addendum.
We're looking at what the jury voted for, against what the state voted for.
There's really a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
Today's university students are not only attacked in their opinion.
I don't remember ever having a college degree in Oxford.
Like my father, my older brother was studying at the university, which I thought was the world's largest home of knowledge, a modern ovary Greek symposium motivated by two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, at the end of the 1980s, I was in the middle of the 20th century two weeks after I came to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, pack up my suitcases, and come back to my first life scandal.
My father grew up and was crying.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I gave up because I had objections to the love of the students in the next room.
Author A. N. Wilson said I'm out of my way because I've been forced to drink out of overcrowded gums.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from private school.
I was persecuted for the only reason and in this collaborator of the supposed enlightenment it was both bigotic and barbaric: my father, lost Woodrow Wyatt, was highly appointed adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a proponent of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why I'm pulling it out right now.
It is simply because the latest reports indicate that a new generation of students suffers from a similar follow-up from the middle.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students enjoyed the same protection of equal rights as gays, persons with health disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Youth Association (JCR) at Corpus Christis College claim that, because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and are shown not to be welcome".
They require the creation of a position in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities, which would ensure that their views can be communicated freely.
Their situation did not even help the recently mentioned BBC documentary series Two with the name Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about the student's political action, which the conservative has treated as a monster and a non-unionist.
In the series, the graduate Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) who rode Rolls-Royce, was dressed in silver clothes and had a silver head.
In other high schools, conservative students say that they are treated as "victims" because of the introduction of higher education.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President Nottingham University Conservative Association, told the Sunday newspaper that "leivic influence on universities is growing.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
A 19-year-old student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is bent on greater protection, says that such a climate is "unappreciable", while the 19-year-old elected president OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in the approach of members of the JCR, the right of people from the middle came to an deterioration.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the good living conditions of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority about one member.
I performed in September 1986, 18 years of age and in a humiliating way.
The hatred for the Conservative side was the worst.
A year earlier, the university voted against the refusal to grant an honorary title to former student Margaret Thatcher for reasons of fraud in the financing of higher education.
From the atmosphere, the Stalinists would be afraid for a moment.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students met between themselves and with the teachers, I got to taste the chicken that was supposed to come.
I found that not only do the professors of silence approve the burial of conservative pupils but they also enjoy it.
In the wood covered by the hearings, the policy of the mining, privatization and resistance of the government to sanctions against apartheid in the South African Republic was introduced.
My first lecture was about the translation of the French text from the 18th century into English and what followed, I was not prepared.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please put in the first paragraph."
I'm tired of it.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a cake pasta, was very yellowish.
"Thatcherovs refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students moved.
I've got tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take some basic French lessons at your leisure, so if you are not too busy with social matters," said Professor Pitt.
I went back to my room.
At dinner at school, I sat by myself when I felt a light grip on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who was represented as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said.
I'm afraid so.
Anyone who's suspected of conservativeism is a coward.
It's already bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even worse for you.
Most conservatives pretend to be laborers.
Later in the local hospital, I tried to pretend.
I was insisting that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be a failure.
A student of the first year of philosophy, politics and economy, who (as irony) went to Eton, said, "You are a daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was crazy, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They're talking to each other, aren't they?
I felt like they had to feel gay before liberal legislation from the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet with people who are like them only after the harvest?
I'd have to turn into a laborer and push my natural tendencies?
Three years in front of me have developed as a cleansing of ignorance and isolation.
The only open conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who lived in my college.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being the counsellor of Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy and one of those who write her speeches.
He wasn't there.
This place hated for his provinciality and for his attachment to the Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he graduated as a professor at the Bilkent University of Turkey in Ankara.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started going from Oxford to my parents' house in London, looking for shelter with my uninterested metropolitan friends and families.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
All political opinions were accepted during his study at Oxford in the '40s.
"But it's the best place in the world," said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreams.
Even my communist friends always had perfect ways.
His naked eyes were dulled.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
The frequent trips to London have made my sense of resistance worse.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, was under pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week, during the course of the course, when another professor of history told me quite seriously that I was "enemies of people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was getting a cold red inside, I confessed that my parents had brainwashed me, and I called them "old fools."
The left was only short-lived.
My Oxford career has been locked up by my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week to Murdoch's news.
My door was locked.
I jumped inside, and after five minutes, my persecutors gave it up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a poor man.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and nuances in the educational institution.
More tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers were raised, but which is also hidden to this day as an undeserved reputation of place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino has a better elegance than fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke to Naty Abascalov, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemis and other famous Italian designer customers.
Somerset House, the old-fashioned residence of Isabely I. English, is the only place in the British capital to host Valentina Garavaniho.
The designer confirmed it at the start of the famous retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion", which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio in the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his irreplaceable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il Signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not have been written without his honored client.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will take place until 3 March, boasts private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important Schleichts, from Princess Salima Aga Chán through the Greek princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from the simple creek from Vogher town in northern Italy to the idol of the international "bohemic garbage".
It's not bad to have a royal family.
"They at least don't touch the crack of cigarettes in a great blanket, as some beautiful pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy a lot and with elegance.
"All of us were very pleased when we were invited to his chat in Gstaad," explains ex-wife "Heini" Thyssen and close friends of the forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always had a better elegance than fame.
And there's a star from him."
Valeria Mazzová plays Valentina
The designer's charisma does not forget the Argentine model Valeria Mazzová.
"It's been many years since we visited him in Piazza di Spagna after a visit to Rome for dinner.
There were twenty of us, and between us, Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every detail of his apartment, his exodus, food, music, he was enchanted in everything and felt his spirit.
All the invitations made him feel important and loving," recalls the top model that began working with him during the Paris week of top fashion in 1995.
"He will never get out of fashion, because his designs are artistic works," he says.
Precautionary monitoring
The buried life is not a story of possessions, but of truly repeated love.
He loves people with good upbringing and better titles and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House was built to a special 70-metre-long pass that offers a change of role: the visitor changes on the model and walks the pass to observe the "obesity" of dreams that Valentine's masterpieces have on himself as a dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that had on himself Monica Vitti in "Nice", or a hat of wool and leather that belonged to Emperor Farah Dibaov.
In the audience the manikin is named Sibilla Lucemburská, Gloria from Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norská, Rosario Bulharská or Sophie Habsburská.
Naty Abascalová and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentine is like the first love, "not to forget him."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, jackets and jackets from the spring-winter collection from 1971 to 1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designers.
"I give him in front of the others a preference for his feminineness and a great love for women, because he's blaspheming our beauty," adds the former Duke of Feria.
"I like the colors that he uses, they explain a lot, and they give "yellow" faces.
Proportions are perfect."
No princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can forget how she first dressed Valentina.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be full and have an opportunity to dress one of his evening dresses...
She finally got there at the end of the 90s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentina for the occasion of a celebration in the palace of my cousin, Prince Edward de Ligne.
They were red dresses that were supposed to fuck with the calls, draw life, and the top without the shoulders.
It was a dream that became a reality," says the widow of Rodrigu d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax for fashion, his passion is overtime," explains an Italian aristocrat whose life revolves between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored designer dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just dress, it's also a memory file that they have in them."
"King" Mode
The golden tomb of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-chantal Miller from her wedding with Paul Greek in 1995.
For the creation of these snow jackets of ivory color with all the pearls, twelve types of different landscapes and a four and a half metre long, there were four months of work and 25 "colkel" (as the designer calls his dresser).
According to reporter Suzy Menkes, the largest authority in the specialized press, these dress-outs represent the top-of-the-end fashion interface of the 20th century, "return clients from high-level society".
Valentino, who was the elite "savour-estre" for years, is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and awarded by the Order of Honorary Law gathers as much comfort as any of his clients' husbands.
"My attention has always been drawn to his choice, calm, adjusted and perfect view," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
"Last month I saw him at the gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my big girlfriend.
He was useless, time on him left no trace."
When the princess says...
The world's toughest handle: cheese carriers in the area of Kawah Ijen
In four euros, carriers in the area of Indonesian soup with their lives and health are gambling when they weigh 70 pounds of cheese down the steep stone paths.
They're people whose work is hell, and they're the ones who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of 400 miners who make their living by obtaining cheese from the Kawah Ijen soup on the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
That's why every day we have to have a faratet down to the bottom of the crater, where we avoid raw gases from the inside of the Earth, and when we contact the air, it goes to a steady state.
After cutting large blocks of cheese, which together weighs up to 70 kilos, it refers to them on the shoulder in two bamboo baskets along the round stone paths.
At the top of the cane, which is only 250 metres, it takes more than 40 minutes for the exhausted cane to rise at a speed up, because they maintain balance and carefully weigh their steps so that they do not slip and fail.
They know that any disturbances could be life, as happened to one French tourist, who went off the Kawah Ijen scale years ago.
Mountainers in Kawah Ien make five cents for every kilo of cheese that costs
When they are upstairs, they travel around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and they tirelessly bring heavy baskets to a vase that the company had placed about something below, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
This is the company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been in the soup since 1960 and has never paid more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of cheese to its employees.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to petrochemical industry, because this disorder has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of lighters, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even white sugar.
"Because it usually weighs 70 pounds, we make about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) each way," explains Anto, who usually completes three trips daily.
One road takes him three hours and is finally destroyed, but it can make 138 000 rupees (11,5 euros) per day.
Even though it appears to be a negligible amount for such unaided efforts, it is a triple of what he would do in the field.
"The daily wage of the miners is very high here. For example, the collection of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) per day and the payment for fourteen days is two million rupees (167)," explains the carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a gardener.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day and the work was not so hard, but Anton returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the well, for a serious reason that is as convincing in Indonesia as cheese: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
He's got asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing, and his eyes are poisoned with toxic gases.
In his 27 years of Anto he risks life three times a day in Kawah Ijen’s soup, whose cheese has already begun to choose his tax, although his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing, and his eyes are poisoned with toxic gases that are avoiding snakes.
That's the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I will work for two more years, because I want to open my shop or study Spanish or French," she promises more than an existing English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man who comes to judgment could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist at the hotel, and instead he does the work of the carrier.
It shares a dirty wooden coat with other wearers and every day gets up in two hours in the morning, because the cheese at night does not cease to mature and its characteristic yellow color changes in blue and September darkness.
Even through the surrounding darkness, Anto goes to the crater and sheds light on the path of a light that he has tied to a helmet and bought it for his own money.
About 400 carriers carry on a shoulder basket with cheese from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has a high income, the demand for cheese for cost savings has not mechanized, nor does it provide for carriers working on their own crops and with such effort, no equipment.
In fact, they do not receive a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the photo collection supplement, which together with the admission for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) select the visitors of the natural park from tourists who come to take pictures of the soup and its human mullets.
"This job is for the gain, not for the people," says Madrusin, a 42-year-old civil carrier who has been working in Kawah Ien for three decades since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 pounds and assures us he'll keep working as long as he can, because he needs money to raise his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the snake was my whole life.
Although the cheese burns the throat and stings in the eyes, when the wind turns unexpectedly and catches the horns in thick rashes that come from the snakes, the miners are so insistent that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases... it is obvious, however, from their frequent breathing difficulties, arthritis, knee pain and shoulder wound caused by the bones.
Uninik, who weighs his basket on his back, can load only 50 pounds in his 53 years.
Every day he and his colleagues remove 15 tons of cheese in the soup, which then three trucks take the steep road between the houses in Tamansari, 18 km away.
"I'm not going to go to retirement, I'm going to die here because the soup was my whole life," says Unainik and opens up a wide mouth in which several teeth are missing.
Of his five sons, the oldest, thirty years old, he's also making a sip of cheese.
The time of the gas, but the constant wait of one of the world's most difficult puzzles lasts from generation to generation - the puzzles that perform human mulls in Kawah Ilen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
The Singaporeans argue that they do not have children, in their careers, stress and cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs growth."
I'm married and I'm the owner, you're my wife and you're the owner.
It may seem unbelievable that this slogan is part of advertising on menthol bonbons, but - or perhaps that is why - the video was massively expanded on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
These words are part of the rap that uses the local cracks of the type "we give the book into the oven" as a smile of birth in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency, which created the video, hopes that this advertising will be able to alert them in a funny way.
The artistic director of the Douglas Hamilton Agency says he wanted to use the influence of music to enable people to fulfill their "citizenal duty".
"It was particularly about the Internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had to feel it's the subject that we have to touch.
We knew that the government had tried a lot of things like expanding perfumes with pheromones or organizing a gathering party.
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but not quite functional.
So we thought about why not do the most creative thing possible, such as the composition of a rap, to solve this problem."
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it very seriously is the Singaporean government.
He makes $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and grants financial contributions.
All these measures, however, had little effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for its representatives' conservativeness and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to population distribution is currently 1.2 children per woman.
Lastly, the birth rate of value 2 was exceeded, which is considered to be the rate of recovery, in 1976.
Why don't the Singaporeans actually have more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Committee on Marriage and the Family of the National Population Office, says it is because of "better education" and "wider range of career opportunities".
"People thus have a wider range of options, as far as life's goals and priorities are concerned, it's not just marriage and family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to the withdrawal of marriage and child care, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there has been a drastic effort to increase the flow of immigrants as a measure against the decline in the number of people, this has led to inviolability among locals.
On some Singapore’s websites, it is possible to see uncovered xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticised for maintaining low wages and a small effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's government has recorded its worst election result from the beginning of independence last year.
After the elections, efforts were made to resolve the problem by means of quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unforeseen consequences
While the decrease in birth rates has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health expenditure and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there have also been some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to keep so many small homes out.
For example, she began to influence real estate trade.
The City Development Office began to regulate the number of small flats known as the "Bot Box" that can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments can support young lifestyles and reflect developers to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of EL Developers, claims that their "boxes from boots" are sold far faster than houses.
"They're more popular, and they're selling themselves for days to weeks faster than houses with a bigger gap.
That's why our money is much better."
However, it admits that the new standards provide clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small homes in one project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could be aimed at increasing the birth rate of the nation, the conversation with Singapore's employees in the financial quarter in the city centre indicates that they will not have much effect.
"People are still under stress, homes are expensive, just like education, so many people are putting off," says a young official.
"The others have children.
But it's important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Men and women refer to careers, stress and cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So whatever the government is trying to force citizens to have children, it's also the end of Singapore, who have the last word of the family.
What is private offline is private and online
Private.
According to a dictionary issued by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is about something that has a personal character or about "the area of private life which every right has to protect against any violation".
What is private for a person 16 years of age?
How does this definition apply in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the danger he is exposed to when he publishes on the Internet things he certainly would not tell anyone in regular communication?
Newspapers from ElPeriodic spoke to five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15, who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four cases, they considered the concept of private for "something entirely own" in the personal level and for "user name and password" if it was a social network.
"I wouldn't publish my biggest secret," said ten-year-old Jorge in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's a very secret secret, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," they say.
"I'm giving the FB nice pictures or pictures as we play.
I'm also talking to famous people.
I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine, or a picture that would make someone laugh," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscenity photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on the FB and his nine Twitter guests.
Most of them are related.
Among them is a mother who has a name and a password of one of the accounts.
"I have posted my Twitter account so that I can express my views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone's gonna answer me, I'm just giving them up there," she adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast communicating with friends," he says.
Without weighing it, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even be interested in recommending someone unknown.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teen own accounts on the Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and the last mentioned network will admit that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them put him on anything, nor did he want an address or phone number after him.
"If they're pushing me or demanding me, it's easy to remove it from their account," she admits.
José applied to Ask after reading his recommendation on Twitter.
Tomuto boys are not foreign experience with what is now called cyberbullying.
"The famous friend on the social network was kicked out.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was," he confirms.
According to José, the victim didn't report.
"She just activated her private regime."
Then explain a series of steps to set the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photos of people in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would have done it if someone had hurt me or just wanted me to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," they say.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate of the Výhýv area and education, believes that in order for children and adolescents to be properly oriented in social networks, they must understand that the main purpose of these networks is to inform them.
They say: "The Internet was created as a means of seeking information, but when a social network emerged, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital Home and Digital Movers, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are the digital immigrants we need to teach them, and then we only learn ourselves," he says.
It explains that it is a complex subject, "because we ask them to know what it is appropriate to spread, to publish and to say, and what, on the contrary, when they are not yet mature."
Also, to be - as far as the environment is concerned - balanced, at the time when it is most desirable to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, it is the most effective way for children and adolescents to show what is private, asking questions that they need to think about.
"Tell them not to do anything, it doesn't work," he adds.
Furthermore, Marrielos Porras has named some of the options: Are there things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this online?
Or: Would you like someone to share your picture with you?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you're marking people on the photos of the party, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more: Does everyone need to know what you're doing all the time?
The next point is to realize that they have to behave in the environment as well as outside the Internet.
It's the same rules.
"A person outside the Internet is guided by respect, morality and other principles and should be the same on social networks," they say.
Overview
Esturdo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher at the first stage, and a teacher, explains that it is necessary for parents to read the rules on social networks carefully.
"If they understand every secret, they have a good basis for talking to their children about the consequences that an online account may have.
For example, about age or what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
The Guard is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "don't talk to other peoples".
The South American Summit ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur) in Peru today ended without the issuing of the Lima Declaration, which was audited and reportedly signed by the seven current presidents.
The Agency has repeatedly sought access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also find that the document will be published later on the Peruvian Government's website.
They further stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollant Humalou in a number of short press statements.
Newspapers have had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the discussion, a video from the Presidential Meeting was broadcast in the press room without a sound with a message "confidential session, audio transmission banned".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press speakers of some governments who were present, not by Peruvian speakers.
The only document published during the course of the discussion was a list of participants with the presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists from different national and international media who requested more information.
Later, the Peruvian President's office sent an e-mail with a "final statement" from the summit, but it was just a statement by President Humaly, not an official document that the summit closed.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of the South American and Arab countries (America del Sur-Paíss Arabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion the promised Declaration from Lima was not originally published, although it was strongly requested.
On the official pages of the ASPA, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure that all journalists were sent, but they completely blocked the information.
The Summit ended, inter alia, with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru, to take the decision of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
The President of Peru Ollanta Humala and the President of Chile Sebastian Pinier met at the regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin on Monday with the hearing of the defence talks between the two parties to discuss the dispute that started with Lima against Santiagu.
"We will take action and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing at this international court today," said President Humala with his Chilean opponent.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, a peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," Piñar added and greeted President Humal with a shake of hands at the train of both countries.
The two presidents confirmed that the decision of the International Court of Justice was published after Colombia adopted this week the Bogotá Pact, which expressed the details of the judgements of the International Court of Justice, which it decided on the sea borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be absolutely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Christiana Kirchner).
Paraguay was excluded from the Unasur organization in 2011 following the resignation of the then President Fernanda Luga and did not attend the meeting.
The host president Ollanta Humala was entrusted with the launch of the early talks and the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The President read a final document informing that 16 agreements were adopted and that 31 projects were planned between the South American countries, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he said that the member countries of the UNASUR will take "significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizen, for which the residence agreements are extended".
He reported that actions are supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap internet in all parts of South America and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in crisis, "he has no economic consolidation (Latin America) to win, but he has to serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the linkage of different locations in South America, especially rural and border areas... to make our countries better connected and create new economic links," the Peruvian President said in a lecture.
He mentioned that five of these projects relate to Peru and its eastern axis from the coast to Brazil, and the other two relate to a better link with Ecuador, but he did not specify more details.
The final document also covered the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return to the Union of the South American Nations", which is currently excluded.
Another issue that the summit raised was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area, which is a celestial and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in a regional meeting that he hoped that on Saturday in Mexico he would meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortego to discuss with respect the judgement of the International Court of Justice regarding the maritime border dispute, which is disputed by the Bogotá.
"It is possible that I will meet President Daniel Ortego tomorrow," Santos said.
"We are discussing all the solutions, none are excluded, nor is the Treaty with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope I will be able to tell President Ortega that we will conduct the most civilized and inconceivable action," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are to participate in the opening of the dark president of Enrique Peña Nety.
During the summit, the EU defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the area of defence.
The members of the UNASUR organization are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last country mentioned is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary president of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa today announced that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal in which "in this case South America must really be taught from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, announced on TV, Peru, that Europeans "killed for World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically one government".
In this sense, the project for the creation of a South American citizenship supported by the Member States of the Unasur organisation has been launched.
"The free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among members of the Andean Community must be achieved, however, there are still areas of return that want us to go back to the past," he noted.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President said that he agreed with the regrouping of the United States Organization (OAS), provided that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States would be reduced and those signatory to the San José Covenant on Human Rights would be taken into consideration.
"Those in charge never commit to anything, and we the South American will sign it all.
It is understandable that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights is funded by the United States in Washington," said the founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange in an attack on political asylum.
President Correa confirmed that he did not read this decision because he did not break his principles and respected his 'deep democratic values and human rights'.
He added that at that time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be issued to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticised the Swedish court, who asked it to be investigated in the Swedish territory for a alleged sexual delinquency, and "the Swedish law allows for a videoconferencing hearing to be conducted by the equatorial embassy in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange will suffer physical and mental health deterioration.
"I haven't talked to him since our embassy, but she kindly informed me that she had little lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But he threatens that his physical and mental condition is getting worse, because he's locked in a small space without the possibility of moving in fresh air.
That would mark everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the asylum solution given to Assange since June at the equatorial embassy in London on the basis of the permits that enables him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks were held with London to resolve the detention of the founder WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but talks have been held all the time.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is leading a series of proceedings at various European courts," he mentioned.
He said, "If the Great Britain leaves tomorrow, it's all over."
And if Sweden listens to Mr. Assange at the equator's embassy in London or through Skype, how without a problem enables dark legislation and as has already been done in other cases, this problem will be done tomorrow."
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and explained that he certainly did not tolerate "subrespectiveness, wrong intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
We are not the biggest enemies of the free press, we are not politicians, but bad journalists in the services of profit, pressure and blackmail," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed joy that neither journalists, "bankers, hegemonic countries nor bourgeoisie do not control Ecuador", and suggested that if he is re-elected, "he will continue in changes guided by the right way and the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain Paraguay's veto on membership in the Unasur Union at least in its future elections and argued that the whole "must be firm and intolerance to opportunism and puhisism rooted in legality", because in fact "has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian President stated that he considered the "very appropriate" wish of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time of the judgement of the International Court in The Hague, which he decided in favour of Nicaragua.
At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.
"It's a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
It is necessary to assess the scope to be overcome and it was possible to go forward."
He also expressed hope in the settlement of the maritime border dispute that is settled at the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is appropriate for Latin America to seek international authorities if both countries are considering taking a decision, whatever the case may be."
In connection with the possibility that he will run in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to be held in a third mandate, he noted that he noticed this option "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa said that if in February 2013 the election loses, it will leave public life.
"I have never personally been interested in the power, but the unfair situation, such as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can only be addressed by political power.
My political movement believed that it was me who guarantees this probable victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I could win, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave politics.
When we lose, it's the same for me.
I've already decided," I said.
Correa also mentioned the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Madura, who says that President Chávez went to scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign was over.
It's not a recovery in the President's health," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State today participated in the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur), which was convened by calls for greater regional integration with a view to maintaining development, equality and security.
Victims of AIDS are today the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizi was 21 years old when his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a lightning hit me," he recalls at a moment of truth, which the doctor was trying to "a little calm down", but apparently without success.
The boy hid it in front of the family.
He decided to take his illness on his own and start to inform himself about it, with such an arrangement that he already celebrated the 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several diseases.
Fabrizio has been living with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was something unimaginable at the beginning of the 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, a little possibility of treatment and a greater stigma.
At the time, he and the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) clinic did not resolve "because he had a cut wound".
Then having AIDS was a synonym for death.
Now it's possible to survive with this syndrome and live in full.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disease and who come here until the virus causes the body to die and causes an immune system, and then they become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since the outbreak of AIDS in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "it is a great success that the length of life of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, confirming this information in the April of this year's prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full-time life depends on the degree of disability in the immune system of patients diagnosed with disease, and are better on those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells may live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply put, it means that the person diagnosed with HIV in 25 years of age can, according to these findings, "live without problems until 75 years", explained the doctor in the interview.
It is worth noting that the average life span of Mexicans is 76 years today.
Although mortality has been significantly reduced in recent years and, in Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the United Nations Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS Yearbook), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients have died since AIDS was found.
Only 255 people died in the state of Jalisco in 2011 and by May 187. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured.
Why do people still die from the effects of the disease?
- "I don't think there's a problem with access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens at our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not exhausted the resources of the medicine. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they do not know the condition of the infections, or in the late stages of the disease."
It adds convincing data: "nine out of ten patients come when there is an associated infection. The only thing we need to do to be able to do more to affect overall mortality is to diagnose the disease first, and that is why it is necessary to offer large-scale tests to identify the disease to all those who are asking for it."
In his proposal, specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco and directly with patients such as Fabrizio, who came to make tests in a private laboratory only because his friend did it, and even through his low age, he had already experienced AIDS and also suffered with Kaposi sarcoma, a cancer disease that is one of the usual complications.
"Everything will change if you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm supposed to die, I'd rather arrange three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for a better, healthy food, exercise, taking drugs."
To this day, his parents know only that he suffered cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activity, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but responsiblely, I pay attention to myself and to another person," says Fabrizio, who took the challenge of sharing his experience with the journal MILENIO JALISCO, to motivate those who are afraid of AIDS today.
"Let them do tests. If they were at risk, let them know if they're HIV positive, it's better. And if they've already been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else when they're responsible."
This message includes the password of battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the desktop
Between health programs and ordinary citizens, Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajar journalist, who is finding information about HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that are dedicated to this task, "the distribution of condoms has really increased, we were given one or two before, today we are given packages and hundreds of condoms, which are very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenage.
"What do you want to do?" is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, medical staff and health personnel who want to avoid teenagers, says the reporter.
He suggested that this ineffective distribution be changed, so that condoms are not only behind the counters, but that hundreds of them be found in dosages in public toilets, in places where young people often walk.
"It's not promiscuity support.
Nor is it "paying beer and motel," as Governor Emilio González responded to the question whether he would agree with the division of condoms during his period.
It's not sexuality. It's best to access condoms to those who already have sexual life," he noted.
Key numbers in Jalisco state
13 435 cases (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV) have been reported.
This condition in Mexico means the fourth place in new and detected cases of AIDS and the 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the infection is sexually transmitted, 6% of the blood route and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV because in one recorded case there are four to five people who do not know about the disease.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Justice, which does not recognise the restructuring of the Group of Vitro’s debt in Mexico, calls for a bad precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
It seems, then, that the restructuring procedures by companies that allow Mexican laws do not apply in the country of channels and stars despite international agreements.
The approval of the judgment issued on 15 June last year by Judge Harline Halem at the North Texas Competition Court leaves in practice a Mexican company without defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other bank of the river el Bravo.
However, the judgment opens the main Mexican producer to the Supreme Court of the United States with an appeal against three imbalances.
It should be said that while the judge of this case claims that the creditors are to be governed by the law of the United States, the Court of Justice of the Fifth Period, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings establish a competition procedure in Mexico.
First, it would indicate the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
For this purpose, a model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law was established, which is defined by an arbitrator by the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the vote of the branch of the internal business structure, when the debt of the parent company Vitro towards the branches is recognised, the required majority would not be attained to the approval of the restructuring.
However, this option is permitted by Mexican law.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first one in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agremex and Commercial Mexican, for which the Federal Competition Institute has held the introductory debt.
In addition, it is true that even after the vote was withdrawn, the believers - who opposed Vitro - who stood in court in the United States, i.e. the "supply" funds, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - did not reach most.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This information shall not be taken into consideration by the court of appeal.
From a different perspective, the Vitro court is guilty of a difficult situation that has been facing since 2008 - in the wake of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
In the meantime, González Sady's family will appeal for a new assessment directly in the court of appeal, so that the assessment will take place for full participation, i.e. for the participation of five judges, because only three were originally voted.
If it fails here, it will be required as a remedy for the revision of the higher court process, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the case of serious cases, the Court referred to the document sent by the Mexican Government as the service of amicius quiae, in which the proceedings of Vitro under the Competition Act are described in detail and indicating that the company has facilitated itself by applying to agreements signed between the two countries in order to confront the law in question with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Law.
Furthermore, it points out that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, this is the rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Visit both sides: punishment for Vitro and state.
Overall assessment
Without noting the table, a few months' criminal notice of the Mexican Aviation Committees against the former owner of Gaston Azcarrag Andrade, who was appointed from the subjugation, and according to the committee's pilots' organisation, has already passed.
The authorities in front of Carlos Díaz Chavez Morineau have just filed a complaint with the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstructing the achievement of justice.
According to it, the control authority systematically refused to report to the Attorney-General of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this undertaking, in which the Bank IXE of F/589 chose, on behalf of the company, 198 million pesos.
The mediums were probably directed to buy the Professional Hotel Management (Administrator Professional de Hotels).
As we know, Azcarrag Andrade is a majority shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Martu's siege
In the Universidad de Caribe area, a group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of associations met on the weekend in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as we know, about the huge shopping and distribution centre with products from "a country with large walls" aimed at Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include the residential area for the employees of 150 companies in the lower part.
The Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) had previously managed to unite the governors of the south-east zone to stand against the monumental area, which would in part exacerbate protected areas and represent the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of business with ACTA document
The request of a Senate which the government did not take into account and which required an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador signed a trade agreement against counterfeiting, known under the English name ACTA, under the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Méxicano de la Propidad Industrial).
As we know, despite the fact that the Senate itself has excluded the possibility to view it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long-term horizon
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and do not affect those short-terms, the development company Homex is placing 500 million pesos on the market for investment certificates.
This series is the first of four identical offers of interest every 28 days.
It's a competition.
The association of leading companies in information technologies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet was formed by an association with a trade name Competival, whose aim will be to market software services in Central and South America.
Investment in business is going to exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The basketball world champion Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been in contact with this saloon sport for more than 60 years and has been prosecuting the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have memories of the history of local basketball, such as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was a player of the BSN national basketball league, the owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the national basketball league, or the President of the Puerto Rican basketball federation, before being supported by him in 2008.
"I stood up during my life in basketball, including several at the same time as I was president of the BSN National League, general manager of the national team and president of the federation," Reyes reminded reporters of Primer Hor at his home in Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel for more than 50 years, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes in his claim of non-violence.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and memory objects from his long career, testify.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest movement from all the guards, those who remember his action in the Vaqueros in the 50s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a teammate or team owner.
"It was my best year, the one I enjoyed most, because I had the opportunity with the team los Vaqueros since 1967 to participate in the eight championships, whether as owner, co-owner, or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five champions from 1971 to 1975.
And then I apologized to one of the champions - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in the BSN.
Then the team took over the "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who was a former coach here and then acting at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said to me, "I have a two-meter player for you.
Do you want it?"
And it was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gauss, who became a team member and one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy brings Bayamon to the championship, Gauss will contribute to the next."
The champion, when the Vaqueros team played Gauss, enjoyed himself, but was far away because in 1988 he had already served as president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his duties and to use Mincy's location on the national team.
"I remember the first time we defeated the United States in a qualifying Olympic match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the world's champion in 1990, where we ended the fourth, but we should have the bronze not to be the Canadian decision-maker who let us repeat the final entry," Reyes said.
Is the world's best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, as well as the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991 when we won gold and we blew up the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that broke our bronze for the world's championship.
This man was not only Mincy, Gauss, Ramona Rivase, Fica López and "Piculina" (Ortiz), but also there were young men (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quiyote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 due to knee injury.
A man who may not have had the perfect composition, but who proved us to win the gold medal and bring great joy, was a man of Olympic qualifications in 1995 in the Argentine Neuquén.
With players on board, such as "Canito" Neves, Pablo Alice and junior player Rolando Hourruitner, who replaced the players excluded because of the competition in the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rica's best player?
It was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rica has reached this level of results such as Piculin.
Don't talk about his behavior in different leagues where he was playing.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arilla's job very much from young people.
Which of your success in the federation do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous age of national manhood in 1988 to 1995 and that by the beginning of the 1990s, BSN had a national league of up to 17 men in one season.
What couldn't you prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce as a division of youth categories according to regions.
For example, boys from Ponce would only play in their field and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in national play-offs.
Now kids travel a lot and play too much games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits of compulsory certificates and courses for trainers, decision-makers and decision-makers.
I'm glad.
What are you dedicated to now?
I listen to music the most, I watch YouTube videos with music from my time, I enjoy my grandkids and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And of course, I'm using my wife Isabel's company, who was always on my side.
The actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, declared the world's main role of John Rosse Ewing, known as "J.R." in the Dallas television series, where he was captured by a man who acted impartially and was aggressive and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role in the precious oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the Dallas television series, became a symbol of famine in the 1980s, he died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died according to the official family announcement that the Associated Press provided the production company Dallas Warner Bros. on Friday afternoon to the cancer-related complications.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he loved best," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the time he died in a remote hospital," her agent Jeffrey Lane announced.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, great, fun, nice, kind and talented, and I'm going to have a hell of a deal with him.
He was unique and lived his life full," Linda Gray said in the announcement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver, and Hagman underwent transplants.
The summer before the Dallas series was broadcast, Hagman celebrated himself as a decent man in a remote comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC station from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the position of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life will change when he meets an attractive girl (Gina), who plays Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies, which were sent only briefly, and to The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His effectiveness in the films included the roles that were well accepted by the critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
It was, however, when Hangman's master's performance was in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to the star top.
The CBS drama series on the Ewings clan and other personalities around them was released from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propaganda slogan "Who shot Jajar?", which was supposed to call for expectation of the work of full emotion, when Hangman's character was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of viewers worldwide, but also the risk of millions of dollars in stock offices.
This also helped to achieve a record in the monitoring process.
The November part of 1980, in which the answer was revealed, followed an average of 41 million TV viewers. Dallas became the second most popular series of history after the end of the 1983 MASH series, which was attended by 50 million viewers.
On J.R. she shot his bat Kristin (who played Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. were pregnant, and then he threatened to label her a prostitute if she didn't leave town.
Hagman played Ewing, a charismatic charismatic farmer: an unfaithful businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked up in the hospital.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be there: "Here lies an honest citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered on Friday on Hagman as someone who was "well-known for the wages and beyond him".
It is unforgettable and irretrievable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who should have known and loved him.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series sent the TNT station a few months ago with great success.
"The performance of five parts of the second series has already been completed and the sixth has just been done," the TV station reported.
Immediately after Hangman's death, no announcements were available from Warner or from the TNT station about how the series will continue.
The father of Fort Worth in Texas was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who was insinuated in classical works, such as the musicians South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931 she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950 ’ s, Larry tried to be happy at the theatre scenes in New York and then served in England from 1952 to 1956 at the airport.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelson, who married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and for a long time lived in the California city of Malibu, where they lived a lot of celebrities.
In 2001 he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't do anything there that I knew could hurt someone or hurt him," said the Press Association Agency.
After liver transplantation, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped combat patients.
"I do them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "Don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starts a course that examines the "end of the world"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would take a course on the end of the world, he knew that it was an inexhaustible object: the end of the "long number" of May calendar, which is due to come on December 21, has caught many people as evidence that the end of the world is coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what was waiting for him in several other months: Catastrophe Hurricane Sandy, a financial disaster that some call "a debt Armageddon", and a growing conflict in which Israel is trapped, where Christians who are theorizing about the end of the world will begin.
"I didn't realize this would be the most unscrupulous semester that ever was," Charmé told Rutgers University students in Camden in New Jersey this week.
It's a really good time when people figure out what's going on in the world today, like we've got 30 days left.
And remember, bad means for apocalyptic thinking good.
And it's not the only professor who offers courses on "the end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, a professional assistant, Barry Vucker, will take a course on "Middles, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students examine apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We choose why these ideas are expanding over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war can break out.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and examine how different they are from real life examples.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," says Vucker.
In the main campus of the State University in Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solariová, a professional assistant in art history and anthropology were given to organize a course with a simple name at the end of the world.
"We don't connect "2012," because we always calculate with the possibility of reorganizing the course if the world doesn't end," said Restall.
Even through "dangerous loss", students must study, create projects and perform final tests.
On Penn State, a final test will take place in the evening of the Apocalypse, which does not give students a chance other than to work "until the evening of the expected end of the world," said Restall.
The cures have become quite popular.
"He was born in two hours," Restall said about his course for students with a high average of 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received an e-mail question as to whether it was still in place.
The students themselves make sure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Rutgers University in Camden 23-year-old Bridged Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield in New Jersey.
And so apocalyptic, worldly, or religious thinking is only a question of comfort or its absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalypse movies.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could be taught," he said.
"I enjoy it."
But no spoken student, but the professor, did not say that he believed in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project was to discuss the Maya prediction and to some extent we will expel it," said Julie Zeglenová, a 21-year-old student of the last year at the Temple University of West Chester.
"May's never foretold the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," said the Restall.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic hardship that spans several centuries back, which people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The flowering of these speculations caused the Internet.
"Some people don't think about it," he said.
This is how it happens in the absolute majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, asked if he knew about any "end of the world" course there, he answered quickly.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," he wrote and pointed out an exception to the highest office.
We have the Pope's mercy.
The restaurant noted that over the years it was about many days of the last court, and said that if nothing was to happen on December 21, "people will start to think immediately about the next date" or to think that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period in which the world will disappear at its end.
The date is taken by the students and the professors.
Several told them they were going to celebrate the end of the world.
"I'll call a few friends to laugh together," explained a 20-year-old student of Samira Ford communication.
