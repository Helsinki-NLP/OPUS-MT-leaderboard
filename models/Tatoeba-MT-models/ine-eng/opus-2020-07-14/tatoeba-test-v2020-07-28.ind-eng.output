What do you want to do next?
His name is Tom.
I can't believe your parents let you go here on your own.
Unfortunately, you have to go to Japan.
I'll give you some advice.
He seems to be getting sick.
I'm not sure yet.
Do you want something to eat?
Are your hopes up?
That'll certainly attract Tom's attention.
Tickets to the museum cost $30.
Do you want something to eat?
I'm working in Tokyo now.
Tom eats alone every day.
Let's defend our marriage.
You're not busy now, are you?
This room has its AC.
Why didn't you help him?
I married when I was 19.
Didn't Tom really know how to cook?
Where's the supermarket around here?
Tom's hair has fallen.
Can I ask you something to drink?
I've done whatever I can.
Please wear your shoes.
Tom's always good to me.
Where does he want to go?
He's a DJ.
We shouldn't have told Tom.
Have you had dinner?
I was happy when I read.
Where do you live?
I want to learn your language.
I want to go for a drink.
When are you going?
Why can Taro speak English better?
Let's do it now.
You're spreading lies.
What's wrong?
I was expecting you last night.
You just made me feel so happy.
Parents are often very wise.
I was sleeping with Markus when he came.
I can't hold my right hand.
I'm hungry.
Yoko refused to answer my question.
Tom is very different from his father.
Like father, like child.
Some of my friends can speak English well.
Tom's on the floor.
He's been a very good man lately.
He's from France.
Tom knew he heard something.
It is more valuable than gold.
I am happy to help him.
Learning about foreign culture is fun.
When did you start wearing them?
Tom wouldn't like that answer.
Oh, really?
I thought you were trying to contact us.
Without hesitation, he refused to give up.
I'm trying to write about ethnicity and minority religion.
I must have made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
The knife's too thick until it can't be used to cut meat, I finally use my pocket knife.
His eyes are blind.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom was the forgetful.
Where are you?
The flashlights are used to set the speed and speed.
Don't let Tom see these photos.
This room has a little sunlight.
He's drawing a picture.
I shouldn't have broken that red light.
Bring me a bucket of water.
I used to be a fool.
The smell's very bad.
The words are the words.
There is no god but God, the Messenger of God.
I just found out yesterday.
You can buy it at the bookstore.
Let's get on the Intercity-Express train.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
My sister likes music.
It's so easy to hang out with Tom.
Want to go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I think I can come this day.
"It's not worth us waiting for two hours." "Yes, I'll keep this sign for the rest of my life."
Tom is one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I just told Tom what Mary told me.
There's sugar, there's garlic.
You'll never find a way home, through a narrow stone road.
Tom really wasn't at home when we came to visit him.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
The guy's driving a car.
It's like a birthday card that'll be coming soon.
Please read it again.
When can you?
I was just kidding.
Tom's almost there.
I'm leaving, too.
Love never goes wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
The cost has already been paid for the professional service to complete the survey.
You don't really want to learn the logo, do you?
Tom tried to seduce Mary to help her.
Two things are not involved.
How could I not realize this?
What's this called?
I'm staying at home because the rain's coming down.
That's the right answer.
In general, men run faster than women.
For me, there was no fundamental difference between the culture of the two countries.
He's acting out.
Get me eight hours right.
Tell me why he doesn't attend.
That may have influenced their decision.
It's raining all night long.
Tom's getting jealous.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that terrible?
I'll buy this bag for you.
The cake's too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Did you ever go to London?
It's our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready yet.
Mary turned down the invitation to the concert.
When are you going home?
He's sitting around his kids.
The boy fell asleep in his bed.
Jim's still not used to driving on the left side of the road.
He's focused on those pieces.
The man died a few hours ago.
Want to go eat with me?
It feels like a dream to me.
I just ate.
We know that the front door is locked.
May I speak to Mr. Sato?
This water doesn't smell.
Mr. Smith was his acquaintance.
Thank you for your interest.
We got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid of flying by plane.
I figured he was lying, but that didn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice, I have to do this.
I couldn’t finish reading this book in a week.
The choice of time is very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have any other options.
I'm not sure what else I have to do.
We've done what we can.
Any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked along this road, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
In front of all our laws, however, the rich sometimes have more advantages.
He must have made it.
I like cats.
It's over at nine o'clock.
Tom's mentally disturbed.
Could I be crazy?
We faced a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, don't I?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone has made a mistake.
You better tell Tom not to.
My mother's been gone for ten years.
No one's perfect.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with the car, just you can't drive.
Can I see your coupon?
He looks serious to read.
Tom married a woman that's easier than he is.
He was a copy of his father's.
He has good words to insult himself.
Maybe I'm fat, but I'm excited.
He tried to kill himself, but he finally failed.
Do you have a light beer?
I want you to reconsider your decision.
If I reincarnate, I want to be born again as a cat.
We've got a lot of rain this summer.
He made an important scientific discovery.
He's a student.
Tom's already here, but Bill hasn't come yet.
Laurie's slow.
They suggest he go alone.
Tom is a good man.
I'll call you back in 20 minutes.
They're swimming.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom Mijam Mary.
Not less than 40 percent of students went to college.
Tom put the pencil on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom made his noise so that no one could hear him.
Did you see anything?
What are you looking at?
Did he take a long walk?
He greets her every morning, when she enters the school building.
I think he's a doctor.
It's very red, it's better off on the left.
We didn't really see that accident.
Her mother was worried about her son.
What's the opera showing at Lincoln Center right now?
I feel bad.
Tom was killed by Mary.
The data is often not accurate.
Wake up!
We've already ordered six-thirty.
We named that dog Tim.
He opened the letter quickly.
Where's the train station?
Tom told Mary to follow him.
It's been an hour.
I'm smarter than them.
It's getting darker.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knows him admires him.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
The car just left.
Those people are crazy!
