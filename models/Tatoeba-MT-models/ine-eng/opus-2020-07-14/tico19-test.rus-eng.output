A rapidly increasing rate of cumulative coronary infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and in the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The cumulative disease of coronary infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and Britain, thus confirming that, despite the various stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive therapy offices, it is necessary to increase the level of readiness for the flow of patients with COVID-19 who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive therapy.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of pneumonia disease of unknown etiology were recorded in the Chinese province of Hubei.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the infection was a new type of coronavirus, now known as a type 2 severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavir infection (COVID-19).
According to the data available to date, approximately 80 per cent of people with COVID-19 suffer from mildly, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, with most of the patients being cured.
Approximately 14 per cent of the COVID-19 cases are developing in a more severe form with the need for hospitalization, while the remaining 6 per cent are critical when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
This study analyses and compares the cumulative rates of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in the United Kingdom with those in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We are also comparing the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom with data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom
Following the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the rest of the world of COVID-19 is currently developing according to the same dynamic as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the issue of Eurosurveillance, on 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease in Europe, which met the WHO criteria for disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on 24 January 2020, all three of whom returned from the Chinese province of Hubay.
As at 15 March 2020, the incidence of COVID-19 infection was identified in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in Britain, with 39 768 cases of infection and 1,727 deaths, of which 17,750, including 1,441 fatalities, occurred in Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative amount and cumulative COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates data on the number of registered cases COVID-19 in each country of the world from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of those countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in the prevalence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK and to compare them with data on Italy.
The cumulative COVID-19 disease was calculated as an indicator of the prevalence of active cases in each EU/EEA country and in Britain for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country for 8:00, 15 March 2020, compared to data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in the development of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK
Trends in the development of COVID-19 cumulative disease for a 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom generally corresponded to the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
The cumulative COVID-19 disease in the EU/EEA and in Britain generally began to grow about 21 February, and a sharp leap of this rate occurred on 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to a rapid increase in the number of registered cases of disease in Italy, but similar trends were observed in all other EU/EEA countries and in Britain to increase COVID-19 cumulative disease (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom as compared to a similar figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already registered as at 8:00 p.m. in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in Britain is comparable to the number recorded in Italy about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 recorded cases in the EU/EEA and in Britain.
The observed trends in COVID-19 cumulative disease suggest that pandemics are developing at comparable rates in all countries.
This is despite different stages in different countries, differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for recognition of disease cases and different patient selection rules for analysis of the presence of COVID-19, including “declarant” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 were required to undergo intensive therapy, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care facilities in these regions had already been fully filled.
Currently, data on the incidence of COVID-19 patients in the hospital and/or intensive treatment in the EU/EEA are available only for 6% and 1% of cases (not reported).
However, a systematic collection of such data should be carried out in order to supplement current monitoring data with the number of recorded cases and the number of deaths.
According to a study conducted in 2010-2011, Europe has a significant volume of cocaine in intensive care and hospital care offices, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal for 100,000 people.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 kroner in intensive therapy and intensive care units for 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
The 6th updated ECDC report on the results of the COVID-19 risk assessment presents scenarios for modelling the load of health systems with assessment data for hospitalization of COVID-19 infected in each EU/EEA country and in Britain, where the risk of lack of available coke in intensive therapy offices exceeds 90 per cent.
As cases are currently grouped into certain regions of the EU/EEA and Great Britain, while hospitals and intensive care units tend to serve the population of a particular territorial group, information on infections and the number of cats in intensive care units is recommended if possible to provide a 2nd level classification of territorial units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and Britain.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for a scenario of contact with SARS-CoV-2, which has not been weakened for a long time, and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive treatment, for example, in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on risk-expression results, there may be little time to consider, take and adjust its response measures if such measures are not taken in advance.
The report on the results of the risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts to slow the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If not, in the next few days or weeks of the health system in other EU/EEA countries, patients who will need intensive therapy will be confronted with flood.
The outbreak of the 2019 coronary infection (COVID-19) caused by the severe severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a tragedy for mankind: more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries of the world, and more than 80,000 have been infected.
Like the homologic SARS-CoV virus, which caused the development of a severe severe respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from flying mice and caused similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is a lower severity and lower mortality than SARS, but it is much more infected and affects older people more often than young people, and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of new disease publications, this article proposes a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving subject of the study.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, forecasting further flow and prevention of the disease.
While the answers to many questions still need to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the dangerous disease.
The spring holiday (China's New Year), which was released on 25 January 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese people who were urged to stay home for and for many weeks after the outbreak of the new virus.
In view of the high level of coronavirus (CoV), which triggered a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) called this virus SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the co-infection associated with coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Uhan and spread rapidly throughout the country and then almost 50 other countries of the world.
According to data from 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases were detected, more than 40,000 patients recovered, and more than 3,000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “an enemy number one for society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.hnhiv.gov/pubmed/), less than two months had more than 200 publications on COVID-19, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarise the results of research in a new and rapidly evolving material area.
As far as possible, we're trying to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronary disease, the coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts known at that time about the prevention and forecasting of the flow of the disease, as well as some other pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been pathogens that are not fatal to humans and are mainly responsible for approximately 15 per cent of general respiratory diseases 4.
However, in this century, we faced twice the high pathogenic human coronavirus, that is, the severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused the outbreak of diseases initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively, and soon spread to many other States with a horrific severity of disease and mortality.
Therefore, the present COVID-19 is the third outbreak of a coronary infection in the history of humanity.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the report on the clusteres of unknown pneumonia was first submitted to the National Commission of Health of the PRC from Uganda on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case was registered in Uganda.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly in neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it became known that medics were infected, which allowed the possibility of human transmission of the virus.
On 23 January, Hurricane Hurricane was introduced, ending urban public transport.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of this disease, 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed coronary infection had direct contact with the market for marine products in Uganda, which was considered to be a starting point for the spread of infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of coronavirus was a global emergency in the field of public health.
At the time of the preparation of the report, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
In view of the rapid development of the situation, the final extent and level of danger of the outbreak still need to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented the following updated picture of the development of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bddA).
All age groups were subject to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but were mainly infected at the age of 30 to 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected were over 50 years old, quite few were under 20 years old, and only 14 had not yet completed 10 years.
Infection of SARS-CoV-2 in men above (0.31/100 000) than in women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was distributed by clusteres mainly in the province of Hubei and in nearby regions.
The mean time from the time of occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms to diagnosis was 5 (2-9) days.
The incubation period was on average 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
From the time of onset of symptoms until death, on average, 9.5 (4.8–13) days passed.
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By 23 January 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infected persons who had been involved in large-scale transport operations prior to the celebration of the New Year.
The mortality rate among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44 per cent (95% CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent) and the corrected mortality rate among patients was 3.06 per cent (95% CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large shell viruses containing one network of meaningful RNAs.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and deltas, of which alpha and beta-coronaviruses are known to attack people.
In the event of exposure to coronal viruses of type SARS and MERS glycoprotein of mucous membranes (S) binds to cell receptors of type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptideylpeptidase-4 (DPP4), respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
Cytoplasm is released by the virus RNA gene; after the virus gene is replication, the gene RNA together with the mucoproteins and the nucleocapside proteins generates virion-containing cells that then merge with the membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on 10 January 2020.
It is established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus, with a gene of 99.98 per cent corresponding to 10 consecutive samples collected in the first phase of the outbreak of the disease in the Hogan marine product market.
Genetic SARS-COV-2 closer to SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
With the aid of an electronic microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particle was found in ultrasonic human respiratory epithelials.
It has been established that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 is associated with an ACE2 enzyme lower than in SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients to have a less severe disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate previously unknown short-lived orf3b and secretified orf8.
Orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play some role in the pathogen of the virus and suppress IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a panel of authors in the head of Žou (Zhou) reported on the cryo-electronic tomography of the structure of a fully measured human ACE2 farm with a permit of 2.9 Å in a complex with a B0AT1 tank carrier.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed formations, was collected as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S proteins, which served as evidence in the identification and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic measure in the conduct of a medical box to suppress the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate owner
It is known that the source and SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV were flying mice, from which the virus was transmitted to the human through the liver and the vertebra respectively.
By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was found that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 are flyers, as the new virus is 96% identical to two coonaviruses, namely the coronaviruses of the SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what kind of intermediate host the virus has been able to overcome the barrier and infect humans; the path of transmission is still to be clarified.
Mr. Czy (Ji) and colleagues suggested that the virus carriers from flying mice to humans became snakes, in which the homologous recombination occurred in S-protein.
According to their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou have assumed that pangolins — long-term dairy farmers who are fed by ants and often used in traditional Chinese medicine — are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99-percent genetic relationship between pangoline and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1 per cent difference between the two genes is very large, so it is considered that the final results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may survive for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of less than 20 °C and 40 to 50 % of moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
Sars-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heat up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; effective blocking of the virus activity may be air, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlorine-disinfecting agents, percussion acid, chloroform and other chlorine-containing solvents, but not chlorohexidine.
The human population in general is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There are currently no data on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, mainly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
As a rule, the virus in the host organism will first recognize the immune system by means of the detection receptors (ORRs), including S-type receptors, Toll receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus induces the expression of inflammation, dendrite cells and type I interferon synthesis, which inhibit virus proliferation and accelerate macrophages phagocytosis with respect to viral antigens.
However, with the N-label SARS-CoV, it can avoid an immune reaction.
Adaptive immune response is soon involved in the fight against the virus.
T-limphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ cells directly kill those affected by the virus.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protective cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T-cells by causing their programmable death.
Humoral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies from a healthy patient have neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperresponse of the immune system involves local education of a large number of free radicals, which may cause serious damage to the light and other organs, and in the worst scenario, to lead to polyorganic deficiency and even death.
Sars-CoV-2 infection, which is a classic phenomenon, is more likely to affect elderly people with side diseases and pregnant women.
The possibility of infection above for people who are affected by a large number of viruses or who have immune system disorders.
According to the study of the first 425 cases of infection in Huhan, the mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period lasted on an average of 3 days, with a distribution of between 0 and 24 days.
The study described above, based on data from 8 866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the time frame for quarantine measures, taking into account the most accurate estimates of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to infected individuals with a disease that is inescapably occurring.
In general, 14-day quarantine has been provided for people who have had contact with the virus or who have been infected with the virus.
Should quarantine be extended until 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often a high temperature, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, headache, throat pain, dizziness, chest pain, diarrhoea, coughing and redness.
Some patients were diagnosed with swelling and/or hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease has progressed rapidly, and patients have developed severe respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperature and/or symptoms of respiratory disease and severe disease should be tested on a virus for early diagnosis even in the absence of pathologies in the pictures of the chest.
The demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 identified the following symptoms: 98 per cent high temperature, 76 per cent dry cough, 55 per cent dry skin and 3 per cent diarrhoea; 8 per cent of patients required artificial ventilation.
Similar results were obtained from the last two studies in cases of infection in the family and the transmission of the virus from unsymptomatic infected individuals.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 in the study of patients with MES-CoV, who also had major symptoms of high temperatures (98 per cent), dry cough (47 per cent) and search (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent of them required artificial ventilation of light, which was much higher than in patients with COVID-19, and corresponded to a higher rate of mortality than in COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperatures (99 to 100 %), dry cough (29 to 75 %), swelling (40 to 42 %), diarrhoea (20 to 25 %) and throat pain (13 to 25 %), and artificial ventilation of mild patients is required 14 to 20 %.
On 14 February, the death rate of COVID-19 was 2 per cent and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Compared to this, the mortality rate from SARS to November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8 096 confirmed cases.
In the case of Mers, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed mortality at 37 per cent of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
As a result of an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 at 95% confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only at intervals between 2 and 4.
Comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARA-COV on symptoms, mortality levels and R0 are shown in Table 1.1.
The above indicators show that SARS-CoV-2 is higher than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate for new viruses is lower than the last two.
Thus, maintaining the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic would be much more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
A cluster of people who have gathered together for some reason or who have come together for a transport, such as a cruise liner, are often infected.
Patients often traveled to Mr. Uhan or other affected regions, lived there or had contact with the infected or sick during the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people may be virus carriers without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who have been removed from the hospital may again be virus carriers, and this is a alarming signal for the length of quarantine.
At an early stage in patients, the number of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood is normal or decreased.
For example, 1 099 patients with COVID-19 had leukocytes < 4×109/L, including leukocytes < 1×109/L, as well as elevated asparagin aminotransferase and virus levels.
In some patients, elevated levels of liver, musculoskeletal and myoglobin enzymes were found in the blood, and in most patients, elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocytes were observed in the blood.
In patients with severe D-dimer disease, fibrin breakdown was increased and the number of lymphocytes was continuously decreased.
Most patients with COVID-19 in the X-ray study of the brain cell had pathology characterized by uneven darks on both sides or in the light “mother’s glass” type.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe mild and severe respiratory disease.
In developing POPs, uncontrollable heating, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis have resulted in a significant gas exchange breach.
Type I and type II pneumonia lowers the level of surface-active compounds and increases the surface pressure, thereby reducing the ability of the mild to expand and increase the risk of fall.
Thus, the worst results of X-rays often coincide with the most serious cases of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the detection of pneumonia, the formation of gylin membranes and intertwine lymphocyte infiltrating, and the multi-nuclear synthetic cells in patients who died of disease correspond to viral infection and ODS pathology and similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the detection method of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA was used through a polymerized chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (CPR with reverse transcriptase).
However, given the high level of false negative results that may accelerate the rate of development of the epidemic, the diagnosis of clinical manifestations has begun in China since 13 February 2020 (no longer based solely on the PCR with reverse transcriptase).
There was a similar situation with SARS diagnosis.
Thus, effective diagnosis is critical and should be combined with the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and the results of X-rays.
On 14 February 2020, a group of experts under the leadership of Mr. Feng Zhang described the SHERLOCK-based methodology for finding SARS-CoV-2; this method allows the detection of synthetic RNC SARS-CoV-2 with a density of 20 × 10–18 moles/l to 200 × 10–18 moles/l (10–100 copies per microlitre of the baseline) with indicators less than the time without the use of complex equipment.
This new method, if tested successfully on clinical medicinal products, can significantly improve the sensitivity and ease of testing.
Due to the lack of experience in the treatment of previously unknown coronary viruses, physicians may mainly provide COPID-19 patients with only supportive therapy while trying to apply any therapeutic methods used or proposed for the treatment of other coronary viruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of anti-virus drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasmas of cured patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even healthy patients should be treated with plasma.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly light, and may have a minor impact on other bodies expressing ACE2, such as the iron and oxygen tract and pouch.
However, the abuse of work and the rejection of breathing organs are the main threat and cause of the death of patients.
Therefore, support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, is critical.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygen (ECMO), a modified method of extra-pullmanic circulation used to treat a life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the importance for patients with SARS-CoV-2 is to maintain water balance, prevent and treat secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as to protect the functions of vital organs.
It is known that cytokine storm is the result of the hyperreaction of patients infected with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine storm is a form of a system-wide burning process that develops in response to a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNA, IFNβ, IFNg and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immunocytes to release huge amounts of free radicals that are the main cause of the development of POPs and polyorphanic deficiency.
In the treatment of cytokines, especially in patients in severe conditions, immunosuppression is essential.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies serving as an interleekin-6 inhibitor were used to treat cytokine storms.
Other methods of treating cytokine storms based on immunosuppression include modulation of the immune reaction to control T-cells; block of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; ion-chinasuppression; blinatumumab, cytokine-signalling susceptors 4 and hytondeasease inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of the effects of inflammatory processes on the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immunosuppressors.
However, high-dose steroids do not benefit from the treatment of severe mild injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they may cause serious side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the forecast.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended to be used with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
There is no confirmed effective anti-virus therapy at the time of the preparation of the document.
However, the internal introduction of remedesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been an effective treatment of the American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesvir is a recently developed anti-virus drug, originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated the possibility of exacerbating other viruses with a one-start RNA, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these data, Gilead has provided this medicine to China for male studies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaiting.
In addition, Baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were proposed as possible options for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, cough, redness, liver damage and other side effects.
The interaction of these medicinal products with other medicinal products designated by patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and the manufacture of antibodies
Bleeding in patients with infectious disease has been used for treatment of other patients with the same disease or for the protection of the health of the population for a long time.
In fact, the blood of healthy patients often has a relatively high amount of antibodies to fight pathogen.
The antibodies are in immunoglobulin produced by B-limphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they identify individual pathogen molecules and neutralize them to the point.
Based on this requirement, plasma was given from blood samples of patients treated with COVID-19, then introduced by 10 severely ill patients.
During 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the rate of inflammation and viral load decreased, as well as increased oxygen blood saturation.
However, in order to propose the use of this method before specific therapy, it is still necessary to carry out a check and explanation.
In addition, given the therapeutic effect, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully investigated.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune system and induce cytokine emission syndrome, which, given its toxicity, poses a potential risk to life.
Blood antibodies are usually low, and blood plasmas are very much required to treat patients in critical conditions.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to assign B cells of healthy patients and to define the genetic code of effective antibodies or to conduct screening to find effective antibodies against critically important virus proteins.
So we can get to the mass production of antibodies right away.
Thousands of Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on the combination of many components of the formula, which is different from the diagnosis of the disease based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have unspecified effects, as the allocation and verification of these components or their optimal combination seems difficult.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific treatment of COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatment methods for patients with mild to moderate severity of symptoms or for patients who recover from a severe disease.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and the Lian Hua Xin Wen capsules (Lian Hua Qing Wen) were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest proportion of healthy patients with COVID-19 was observed in several provinces of China, where Chinese traditional treatment was applied to 87 per cent of patients, including in Ghana (63.7 per cent), Ninse (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in the province of Hubei, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19, the lowest rate of cure was recorded (13 per cent).
However, this is a rather rough comparison, as the assessment should take into account the many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published research materials that compared treatment with Western medicine and combined treatment with Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the time limit for normalization of body temperature, symptoms and hospital care was less felt in patients treated with Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in patients treated with Western methods alone.
The most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who started to develop symptoms (from mild to severe) was seen below in a group treated by combining Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods than in a group treated only by Western methods (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second group (8.8 per cent compared to 39 per cent).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more closely controlled research conducted in larger and larger regions.
The specific interest is also to obtain, as soon as possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the aspects of the effectiveness of the components used in or their combination in Chinese traditional medicine.
Patients suspected or confirmed that there is COVID-19 are mainly afraid of acute and even fatal disease, while quarantined patients also experience nausea, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, infections such as disease, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as corticosteroid insomnia, may cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
Early outbreaks of the SARS virus reported a number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor inflammation, psychiatric symptoms, delirium and even suicide.
Compulsory monitoring of contacts and quarantines, among the measures taken by health authorities to control the COVID-19 epidemic, can raise people's anxiety and guilt over the spread of infection, quarantine and social glue on their families and friends.
In this context, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspected and in touch with them, as well as to all others required.
In the framework of psychological support, multi-profile psychiatric care units should be formed, provide clear information with regular and accurate updating of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans and use professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in preventing the transmission from animal carriers of infection and infected people to susceptible owners and are often used in addition to anti-virus therapy used to control epidemics caused by new viruses.
The establishment of S-protein-based vaccines aimed at producing long-lived and highly active neutralising antibodies and/or protective immunity to SARS-CoV has been undertaken.
Lively weakened SARS virus vaccines have been developed in animal studies.
However, prior to the start of clinical studies, the effectiveness of these possible vaccines should be further determined in the natural environment when used in elderly patients, the model for fatal dose infection and the level of protection against infection by zoonoses.
Perhaps the reason that SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago has not yet been reported in any new case.
At the same time, sporadic cases and disease clusters caused by the Mers virus in the Middle East and spread to other regions continue to occur through the conservation of zoonoses in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed to combat MERS using inactivated virus, plasma DNA, viral vectors, nanoparticles, particulate matter and components of recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for people with no immunity is an urgent and critical challenge that requires a solution to prevent the epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long-term (average 18 months) required to develop the vaccine and the dynamic change in the coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a full picture of the clinical flow of the disease in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without difficulty.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
Therefore, it is critical for health authorities to establish a forecasting disease model to determine the priority of their action, especially in areas where there is a shortage of resources.
Based on current clinical studies, the following factors may influence the forecasting of disease in patients with COVID-19 or be associated with it (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor in predicting the flow of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between 30 and 65 years of age, 47.7 per cent of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the study mentioned above, 8 866 cases.
Patients who were required to undergo intensive therapy were more likely to have baseline diseases and complications and were significantly older than those who did not require such therapy (mean 66 years compared to 51 years), which shows that age is a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men above (0.31/100 000 vs 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Sickness and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop severe myocardial infarction and arrhythmias.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of the death of patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also be associated with positive ACE2 holangiocytes, which could cause a failure of liver work in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and baseline diseases are closely linked and can distort the results.
Derogations from laboratory studies: A blood-reactive protein level reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential predictive factor in the flow of the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the C-reactive protein level, the severity of the disease and the forecast for COVID-19.
In addition, the results can also predict higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagin aminotranspherase, alanine aminotranspherase and creatinine.
These enzymes are distributed in large quantities by different organs, especially the heart and the liver, and their emissions are caused by tissue damage.
They are therefore traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: X-ray data and time-consuming clinical symptoms should be taken into account in order to predict the results and complications of treatment with COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressors widely used in infectious diseases as additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids have been widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the patients have developed osteonecrosis that is due to life-threatening disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if steroids are to be used to treat patients with COVID-19, these medicinal products should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, many patients suffer from unexpected severe stress in the background of the COVID-19 epidemic because they often have to endure long quarantine periods, cope with high uncertainty and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
In order to remove stress from such patients and to help them return to normal life, they must be consulted psychologically and provide long-term support.
According to demographic studies at present, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to the lower respiratory pathways, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as other coronary viruses that cause common cold diseases, can successfully reproduce in upper respiratory pathways and cause mild symptoms or not at all symptoms at the early stages of infection.
Therefore, patients who have or have not completed the early stage of the disease or the incubation period may, through their normal life, spread the virus to a significant extent, which significantly impedes epidemiological control.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV virus was considered to occur when patients were severely ill, most of which did not occur at the early stages of the infection.
Thus, the COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious today and is more difficult to control.
China is currently doing a great deal of work, as announced by the General Quarantine in Uganda and the neighbouring cities, as well as the extended quarantine regime for virtually all the population introduced to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Although these measures have a significant economic and other aspects of the country ' s life, the number of new patients identified has decreased, which says that the spread of the epidemic is slowing.
According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak of the disease will end by March and the phase of the drought will extend from 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Hunter) and colleagues believed that the COVID-19 explosion, which seemed much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the team led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) formed a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and assumed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could defeat two thirds of the world's population.
The group of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in nose and throat muscles taken in patients who were cured and diagnosed two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical influenza similar to the influenza.
However, a reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the current strategy may have had an impact.
According to the original estimate, the Ebola disease had to be defeated by up to a million people and caused the death of half a million patients.
But with severe quarantine and isolation of diseases, it was finally able to be controlled.
It is likely that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be weakened, and over time it will disappear or become less pathogenic to humans.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through cough or sneezing, as well as possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in the cauliflower, which means that it is also possible to transmit oral and oral.
According to one recent study, 41 per cent of 138 patients were reported to have been infected in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 patients with medersonal.
Therefore, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even foreign patients.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks for the person; and surgical masks, and N95 (No. 1860s series) fans help control the spread of viruses.
Surgery masks do not give the microcapillary fluids of potentially infected people to fly into the air and sit on the surfaces from which they can be transferred to the surrounding area.
However, only Class N95 (Series No. 1860s) can protect against the inhalation of viruses of 10 to 80 nm, they pass only 5 per cent of viruses; SARS-CoV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-CoV, both of which are about 85 nm.
As particles can penetrate even through five joint surgical masks, medical workers directly contacting patients must wear N95 masks (series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical workers should wear a protective coat mounted on the figure to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also fall into the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a Class N95 mask; the virus may have fallen into his body through the inflammation of the eyes.
Medical workers should therefore also wear transparent face shields or protective eyes of a closed type.
It is strongly recommended that all populations in affected or potentially endangered regions are more likely to wash their hands with degenerative means, avoid self-insulation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is considered a distance of about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus had not previously been known to mankind, the high level of its similarity to SARS-CoV reported on 7 January 2020 should have been a disturbing signal to China, taking into account the experience they had acquired during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020, the Director of the Center for Disease Control in Uganda calmed the citizens, stating that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproductiveity when transferred from human to human and that prevention of disease and control would not be a problem.
This statement significantly reduced social tension, especially during the time when the whole country was ready to celebrate the New Year of China, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be held within the limits of Mr. Uhan with minimal losses.
China's health authorities can take this strong lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since each word is taken into account by citizens and may affect their attitude and decisions; (2) monitor and respond to unusual information coming from the clinic rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to prevent the potential epidemic at the early stages of its development and not to calm the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective training to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regular checks and improve the response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by previously unsolicited coronavirus of type 2 severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), began at the end of December 2019.
Less than two months later, the disease covered all of China and was spread to 50 countries in the world at the time of the preparation of the document.
Because the virus is very similar to a coronary severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the COVID-19 symptoms are similar to the severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), a feeling of SARS resuscitation occurred at the start of the COVID-19.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS in terms of preventing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and men more than women; the proportion of serious cases and the level of mortality among older people is also higher than among young people.
Mortality due to SARS is higher than for COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is unsymptomatic, while patients with SARS are usually infected only in severe cases, thus preventing the spread of COVID-19 is more difficult than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is much faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative conventional evidence of RNA SARS-COV-2.
On the other hand, patients who have been treated can show positive virus tests again.
All of this significantly increases the risk of virus proliferation.
In the light of such rapid progress in COVID-19 studies, some key issues remain to be addressed, namely:
What's the origin of SARS-CoV-2?
Despite the discovery of a 96-percent homologous between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses of flying mice, we still cannot claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred from flying mice.
What animal became an intermediate type of virus transmitted from the original owner, such as from flying mice, to humans?
I do not know the answers to the first and second questions, we can't really stop the transfer, and the epidemiological situation can get worse at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, but how exactly is the virus involved in respiratory cells and causing subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with developing ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic continue?
How does the virus evolve genetically in the process of human transfer?
Will it be the cause of the global pandemic, will it also disappear like SARS, or will it periodically relapse like the flu?
These aspects are of primary importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Zone-specific origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the development of coronaviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including people, for thousands of years.
By 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCOV) had been known to cause an easy disease, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronary infection can be.
The occurrence of a severe second-type severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 refocused on coronary viruses and surprised us with high transmission, but with a weaker pathogenicity of this virus compared to the relative SARS-CoV virus.
Coronavirus human infection is a zoonose, and understanding of its origin will be very useful.
Most human coronary viruses come from flying mice for which they are not pathogens.
Intermediate reservoirs of some human coronaviruses are also known.
The identification of animals directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interactions of the animals that carry coronaviruses can also shed light on the pathogen of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we provide data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery and their zoonotic origin and ways of intermodal transmission.
It is important to note that we compare and compare various human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of coronary disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19) is also being considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for the successful exchange of carriers and the effect of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of vertebral viruses with a positive-polar chain of RNA.
These viruses, the largest of the RNA-containing viruses of between 26 and 32,000 nucleotides, were named because of their form, which reminds the crown when considered under the electronic microscope.
From the point of view of structure, coronaviruses contain unsegregated genes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genes contain two large open partially overcrowded accounting frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are transmitted to the polyproteins of the pp1a and pp1ab replicas.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins marked nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the gene contains an open accounting framework for structured proteins, including schizophrenic proteins (S), envelope proteins (E), membrane proteins (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other coronavirus lines also coded a number of linear accesory proteins.
Depending on the differences in the sequences of white\coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha, beta, gamma, and deltacoronaviruses), including most human coronaviruses (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that most alpha- and beta-coronaviruses are the flying mouse and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently overcome intermodal barriers, and some of them have evolved into dangerous pathogens for humans.
Seven human coronary viruses are known to date.
These include human alphachoronaviruses HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63.
The other five beta-coronaviruses include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV), close-east respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) and severe severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
Human coronaviruses HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of mild form such as cold and/or diarrhoea.
Unlike these, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently detected SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe infections of lower respiratory pathways in a relatively higher number of patients with a higher probability of developing severe respiratory disease (ORS) and developing extraneous symptoms.
The first human coronavirus HCOV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample of patients with cold disease in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has provided more detailed information on HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 viruses that cause local infections.
Indeed, before the outbreak of a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronary infection was generally considered harmless.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 was one of the most devastating epidemics in the current history; more than 8,000 people were injured and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic in the Arab Peninsula, and the disease spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) discovered in 2019, which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, was the cause of the current coronary infection epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which, as of 3 March 2020, increased by more than 3,120 lives, and the number of people infected exceeded 91,000.
A warning signal has been received, and the world must be prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin, their sources are flyers, mice or domestic animals.
Many data sets show the evolution of all human coronaviruses from flying mice, to which viruses have been well adapted and in which no pathogens have been found, but demonstrate a wide variety of genetics.
The COVID-19 epidemic has left China and the world with serious health, scientific, social and moral challenges.
A study of the zoonotic mechanism of the origin of human coronaviruses will enable them to understand their natural history, the driving force of their evolution and the factors limiting intermodal transmission.
It may also suggest or speed up the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifier carrier SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent further spread of the disease in the future.
This review contains general information on zoonotic origin, intermodal transmission and pathogens of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we note and consider the following general feature: the source viruses from which human coronaviruses have occurred are not usually pathogens for their reservoir carriers, but are acquired pathogens after the inter-mediate transmission to the new carrier.
We are also analysing the evolution of human coronary viruses, according to which the increase in transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of the pathogens.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 explosion is also being considered.
Coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before strain B814 of the HPV-229E virus was first obtained from a sample of patients who had a cold disease, different coronary viruses were found in different infected animals, including indexes, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 provides a brief history of the discovery of human coronary viruses in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with infection of the upper respiratory tract in 1966; the virus was further adapted to the reproduction of WI-38 leg cells.
Patients infected with HCV-229E had cold symptoms, including headache, vomiting, general malaise and throat pain, with high temperatures and cough observed in 10 to 20 per cent of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCOV-OC43 virus was derived from organic culture and subsequent serial passage into the brain of mice.
The clinical signs of HCV-OC43 virus infection are similar to those of HCV-229E virus infection, whose symptoms are unique to other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both the HCV-229E virus and the HCV-OC43 virus are widely distributed worldwide and are usually transmitted in winter at moderate intervals.
The primary incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of disease.
According to the results of the study in volunteers, in healthy people infected with HCV-229E, a common cold was developed in a light form.
Only a few patients with weak immunity experienced severe respiratory tract infection.
The outbreak of SARS, also known as the “Atypical Pneumonia epidemic”, has been the first in all history of humanity to be a well-documented pandemic caused by human coronavirus and a virus of SARS-CoV, a third of the detected human coronavirus.
The first case of SARS was discovered at the end of 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdun.
During the SARS epidemic, 8 096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented and disease spread in many countries and in different continents.
Without regard to the super-active distributors, it was estimated that each patient could be infected by about two more persons; the incubation period was between 4 and 7 days, and the viral load peak reached on the 10th day of the disease.
In patients infected with SARS-CoV, muscle pain, major pain, high temperature, general malaise and swelling were initially observed, and later symptoms included swelling, cough, and respiratory failure.
The laboratory deviations from the standards in SARS are lymphopaenia, liver failure and elevated creatinine.
Patients with SARS also experience diffuse alveolar damage, the proliferation of epithelial cells and the rise in macrophages.
Some 20-30 per cent of patients subsequently need intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation.
In such severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory pathways, other organs may also be infected, including the iron and oxygen tract organs, liver and thighs, which are usually accompanied by cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
For the first time, the virus was made up of an open biopsy of a mild relative of the patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate human coronary viruses.
At the end of 2004, HCOV-NL63 was awarded to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
Initially, it was found that it was mainly affecting children of younger age, older people and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
For the disease caused by HCOV-NL63, there are signs such as nightmares, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study describes the same virus from a home material taken from an 8-month-old male from the Netherlands who suffers pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but in fact it is widely distributed.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases, and the peak of the diseases it causes is the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive larynx, which is also called a crust.
HCOV-HKU1 was awarded in Hong Kong in the same year by a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to non-inflammatory pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCOV-HKU1 is associated with aggravation of asthma.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, the HCOV-HKU1 virus, which causes respiratory diseases in a light form, has been found worldwide.
All these four human coronaviruses, which cause infective infections, have been well adapted to people, and their mutations, which lead to highly pathogenic diseases, are generally unlikely, although their causes were unknown, as a rare example of a more virulent subtype of HCV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has caused a serious infection of lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Usually, by acquiring the ability to effectively transfer and maintain into the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogen.
The coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first awarded in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from a mild 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and a severe lack of baseline.
Most of the laboratory confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, there have been reports of accidents and spreads through epidemic secondary infections in close contact.
Another second blast with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) remind of symptoms of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) — both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed a severe initial deficiency, which still distinguishes MERS from the remaining diseases caused by coronary viruses that are transmitted to humans.
More than 30 per cent of patients experience jaundice symptoms, such as diarrhoea and redness.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratoryly confirmed cases of a high-death respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (34.4%) have been registered, and therefore MERS-CoV is considered one of the most deadly viruses known to man.
From mid to the end of December 2019, in the Chinese province of Hubey, Uhan, patient clusters have been identified with pneumonia, which are now linked to the infection caused by the severe severe type 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of low respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global emergency in public health, and the disease itself has been called “coronavirus infection 19” (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases were registered worldwide, with mortality being approximately 3.4 per cent.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2 per cent, and outside the Chinese province is 1.2 per cent.
SARS-CoV-2, similar to coronal viruses SARS and MERS, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by increased temperature, cough and swelling.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to quickly enter a severe respiratory failure syndrome.
Although the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses form different phylogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but has a greater ability to transfer than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of unsympathetic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been recorded, indicating the ability of this virus to spread rapidly across the world.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other six human coronaviruses identify important similarities and differences.
First, coronavirus transmissions have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease they cause.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the rest of the six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coronary viruses causing non-inflammatory infections (e.g. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections are similar to those observed most frequently in human coronary infections that cause non-infection, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV, a small subset of serious cases of COVID-19 can be identified, although the ratio is slightly below.
Thirdly, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 also includes interesting legalities that are characteristic of both human coronaviruses causing infective infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as human coronaviruses causing infective infections.
On the other hand, it is still to be verified whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with each subsequent virus transition (i.e. infection of each next person) is reduced, such as in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause infective infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the samples of kala.
We still need to answer the question of whether the faecal-oral route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Special interest is also the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronary viruses that cause non-infectious infections.
However, the future development of the continuing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathology and sustainable distribution after crossing through people.
All four human coronaviruses that cause non-inflammatory infections with symptoms of mild form have been well adapted to people.
On the other hand, these people may well have adapted to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both those and others could be called the only survivors after the pandemics of human coronary viruses in the past.
Human coronaviruses that cause severe diseases in humans, and people with human coronaviruses that cause severe diseases simply did not survive.
To that end, human coronaviruses must be replicationd in human body to a sufficient degree to produce adaptive mutations that are contrary to carrier restraint.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 explosion will continue and the more people will be infected, the more likely the virus will be completely adapted to the human being.
If it is well adapted, its transmission to people will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other activities to control infectious diseases.
For many years, four outpatient coronaviruses have been circulating in the population, causing normal immunity to people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require an animal reserve.
The high-level coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans sufficiently well, and their transfer to humans cannot be supported.
They must be kept and propagated in their zoonose reservoirs and seek out a case of falling into susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or aggravating carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has drawings similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, and four HCOV outpatient viruses.
It is very easy to pass on, at least at the present time, as non-hospital HCV.
But he's more pathogen than non-inflammatory HCV, and less pathogen than SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to the human being and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the origin of HCOV viruses, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutional, natural, intermediate, strengthening and reservoir carriers of HCOV viruses.
The animal is the evolutionary carrier of the HCOV if it carries a progenitor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The previous virus is usually well-adapted and unpathogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the HCOV shall be carried over continuously for a long time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCOV or its parental virus.
Unlike that, if the HCOV was only taken into the intermediate carrier directly before or about the time it was taken to the person, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and often pathogen.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play a role as an amplifier carrier, allowing the virus to be properly replicated and then transmitted to its people, increasing the level of human infection.
The HCOV may transmit a topical infection if it is not possible to maintain a transfer within the intermittent carrier.
On the contrary, HCOV viruses can also be adapted to the intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reserve carrier.
Epidemiological data have shown retrospectively that a zero SARS patient has had a history of contact with hunting and fishing animals (i.e. animals).
Further sero-prevalence studies have shown that IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV virus are more prevalent in animal dealers than in the general population.
The Paguma larvaa and anatomical dog on the markets of live animals have become the first identified virus carriers, similar and almost identical SARS-CoV.
This was explicitly confirmed by the fact that after the destruction of all the markets for SARS cases, no longer reported.
At the same time, it has been reported that, in the case of the Himalayan civilizations living in nature or on farms and not on markets, SARS-CoV was not determined in most cases, which would lead to the conclusion that the Himalayan civilizations could only serve as an intermediate enhancer rather than a natural SARS-CoV reservoir.
Significantly, since 80 per cent of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be excluded that intermediate enhancers can also serve many small dairy species.
They all seem to be the deadliest carrier of SARS-CoV virus.
The subsequent search for the natural animal carrier SARS-CoV identified a nearby CoV flying mouse, which was called the atypical pneumonium coronavirus of HKU3 (SARSR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese flying mice.
These mice are positive on the antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other coronaviruses of flying mice account for between 88 and 92 per cent of the same nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundations for a new concept that flyers have become the bearers of new human pathogens.
Some SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been detected in flying mice, but none of them, except one that represents WIV1, cannot be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that the SARS-CoV receptor is a human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, obtained from a faecal sample of flying mice, uses ACE2 flying mice, civ and humans as a receptor for entering the cell.
It is curious that the rash of healthy patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV in flying mice, dividing 95 per cent of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, WIV1 is generally considered not to be the direct parental virus SARS-CoV and the flyer is not the direct reservoir carrier SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis refers to the same group as the CoV-HKU4 fly mouse and the CoV-HKU5 fly mouse.
CoV-HKU4 flyers and MERS-COV use the same carrier receiver, dipeptildipeptidase-4 (DPP4), for the introduction of viruses.
The traceability of the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase virus MERS-CoV is significantly closer to the sequences of the beta-coronaviruses of flying mice detected in Europe and Africa.
So far, there's been no live mers-coV virus in the wild flying mice.
Mers-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 are only 87 per cent of the nucleotide sequences.
That is, flying mice could not be the direct replacement carrier of the Mers-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that unicorns are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as those of Middle East origin in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, the identical virus found in humans, has been derived from the nasal muscles of the unicorns, which further confirms the role of the vertebrates as true reservoir carriers MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that small symptoms have been observed in females that have been experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, but that there has been a massive virus division.
It is noteworthy that infected vampires have not only provided the virus with a respiratory tract but also a pheasant, which is also the main source of the virus in flying mice.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome have not been in the history of pre-symptom contact and are likely to be related to the transfer of human beings or to the transfer of unknown channels, including unestablished species of animals that are MERS-CoV carriers.
The SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide geology is 96.2% similar to the CoV RatG13 flying mice assigned to the Asian subcoon Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the diversity of the sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too large to attribute parental relations to them.
That is, flying mice could and would not be a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical coronaviruses of flying mice were found in the future.
It is assumed that direct animal carriers of SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species sold and killed in the ocean-optimized market for marine products that have been associated with many of the initial cases of COVID-19, which indicates the likely case of animal transmission.
A few recent studies based on metagenic sequencing have concluded that a group threatened with the destruction of small dairy animals known as pangoline (Manis javanica) could also carry a parent beta-coronavirus, a family strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the sequences of nucleotides of these new genes of the pangoline coronavirus 85-92% coincides with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RatG13, with the identity at the nucleotide sequence level being approximately 90 per cent.
They are classified in two real differences of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which is a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with a 97.4 per cent amino acid sequence.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are more divergent, despite the higher degree of homology of sequence throughout the gene.
An earlier study of pangoline diseases also reported the detection of viral contagion in samples of mild, which were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, other methods of collection and manual processing were used to obtain a gene sequence of about 86.3 per cent of the full-scale viral gene.
It cannot be excluded that pangoline has become one of the intermediate animal carriers SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the differentiation of the sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus pangoline relative to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangoline.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in flying mice, pangolins and other dairy animals has not yet been established.
At that time, the highest sequence homology was found in RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus pangolins, relative to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13, the highest sequence homology throughout the genome.
Very theoretically, the high level of similarity between pangoline beta-coV-2, and SARS-coV-2 are related to parallel evolution through selectiveity.
The opposite is for the recombination between the beta-coronavirus pangoline, the relative SARS-CoV-2, and the ratG13 in the third type of wild animals.
As a driving force of evolution, the recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HPV viruses, the origin of HCV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 is also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence shows that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E can be derived from coronaviruses of flying mice, while parental strain viruses HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
It was reported that the coronavirus of the flying mice called ARCoV.2 (Applaachian Ridge CoV) and discovered in the North American tricolor dosso, demonstrates a close relationship with the HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E is genetically related to another coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier could also be femoral.
For the sake of clarity, the modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and in Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of the events of the intermodal transmission of HCV in anamnesia.
When the HCOV-OC43 virus was inter-mediated in 1890 and humans were infected by domestic animals, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of the HCV-229E intermediation is not so clear.
Alphaconaviruses of flying mice, near-natural HCV-229E were detected.
There are alpha-coronavirus alpaca among them.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from flying mice.
First, that is, people, not alpacas, could contact flying mice in a common environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alpines.
Second, the alphaconaviruses of flying mice, the family HCV-229E, are diverse and non-pathogenic in flying mice, while the alpaca alfa virus has caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alphacoronavirus was not found in wild animals.
Thus, it is not possible to rule out the possibility that alpacas have received an alphacoronavirus, a family HCOV-229E, from humans.
In fact, flying mice are a direct source of human pathogens, including the virus of substance, the virus of Ebola, the virus of Nipah and the virus of Hendra.
It is not surprising, therefore, that flying mice could directly transmit HCOV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while the alphaconaviruses of flying mice were able to serve the HCOV-229E gene pool, the alpines and the one- doves could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERCS-COV is an excellent example of intermediate transmission from flying mice to single vertebrae and from single vertebrae to human vertebrae.
The evolutionary origin of the Mers-CoV virus from flying mice is known for its initial identification and was subsequently confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is obvious that flying mice provide a rich pool of viruses for intermodal exchange of gene fragments and intermodal transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and ability to fly make flying mice “ideal distributors”.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to single-wing females decades ago.
It has adapted well to those who have become a stable and natural reserve carrier from the intermediate carrier.
In these animal viruses, Mers-CoV causes a very easy disease and is relatively low in mutation rates.
Its episodic transmission to a person is a coincidence, and the person remains a neutral carrier of MERS-COV, since its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of females in the Mers-CoV transmission, the role of the pangoline, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, the pangoline beta-coronavirus is highly pathogenic to the pangoline.
They may be the neutral carriers of beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as in SARS-CoV.
In future studies it is necessary to confirm or delete a number of possibilities for the intermodal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals.
First, flying mice can be a spare carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share an environmental nest with flying mice by viewing or cutting the dusts of these animals.
Secondly, the pangolins may be one of the intermediate boosters in which the SARS-CoV-2 virus has fallen recently.
People are infected by the virus through the division of dust and the use of wild animals in food.
Many animals, including domestic animals, may be accepted by SARS-CoV-2.
The examination of domestic and wild animals on the antibody is justified.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third form, which contacted both flying mice and penguins.
The search for animal origin SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to different types of animal carriers, three major factors from viruses also contributed to cross-border barriers.
First of all, they are relatively high rate of mutations in the replication of RNA.
Compared to other single-stage RNA viruses, the estimated frequency of coronary mutations can be considered to be “moderately high” with the average frequency of replacement of approximately 10-4 per year in one section of 2 depending on the phase of the adaptation of the coronary virus to new owners.
Coronaviruses have a rectification of exorboneuclease, which removes the extremely high rate of mutation and weakening or even incapacity.
It is interesting that the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir suppresses the replication of coronavirus due to the inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising means against SARS-CoV-2 to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of coronary mutations is almost a million times higher than that of their carriers.
In addition, the rate of mutation may often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high rate of mutation, the rate of mutations SARS-CoV-2 is shown below, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
The virus is likely to have been adapted to another carrier close to the human being.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well-adapted to unicorns.
Theoretically, vaccines and antivirals from SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to lose their effectiveness as a result of a genetic drain.
Secondly, the large RNA gene in the coronavirus results in greater plasticity in the gene modification for mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-mediate co-evolution that is conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.
This contributes to a number of unique open accounting frameworks and protein functions encoded in 3′-end of the gene.
Thirdly, thanks to the unique mechanism for selecting the matrix, coronaviruses randomly and often switch the matrix during the replication of the RNA.
During the transcription of the coronavirus DNA into the carrier, which serves as a mixture vessel, there is often a change in the tissue.
High-level and subgenum RNAs can recombinate and create new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43 and in animal coronaviruses such as SL-COV and batCOV-HKU9 flying mice.
Interaction of the virus-bearer with regard to transmission
In addition to the above three virus factors, the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor is another key factor that is important for inter-mediation.
In this article, as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of a positive selection in the event of an intermediate transfer, the SARS-CoV recombination is presented.
Based on a comparative analysis between human SARS-COV strains and cytokines, it is considered that SARS-COV is undergoing rapid adaptation in different carriers, especially with regard to RSD mutations of white S.
In general, RSD is a coronavirus that interacts with the cell receptor, and the antibody's response is intensively chosen.
SARS-CoV RSDs are amino acids, 318 to 510 on the S1 fragment, which are associated with an angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (APF2) and its receptors for the introduction of the virus into the cell.
The SARS-CoV virus RSD is capable of identifying APF2 receptors from different animals, including mouse, civet, mouse and anatomical dogs, making it possible to transmit the virus inter-mediately.
In fact, RSD found only 6 amino-isolate residues that differ from human and cytotoxic viral strains, with 4 of them in a binding receiver for interaction with the AFP2 receptor.
SARS-CoVs have K479N and S487T mutations in RSD, which may increase the affinity of the cross-sectional protein interaction with human AFP2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids can be particularly important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30 per cent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein S segment suggests that the binding affinity of the S protein to human AFP2 may have changed.
Indeed, a study using a cryoelectronic microscope says that the affinity of this link is 10-20 times higher than between APF2 human and S virus SARS-CoV protein.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other receivers were required to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCOV-NL63 is also associated with APF2, but with another section of White S.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCOV-229E and 9-O-acetylsylic acid for HCOV-OC43.
They can also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses to humans after the intermodal transmission from animals.
In addition to cell receptors, the outcome of the HCOV intermediation is also managed by other factors of dependence and restraint of the carrier.
The diversity of these proteins between humans and the natural reserve carriers of HCOVs, such as flyers, single-bred calves and pigs, may constitute a barrier to inter-modal transmission.
In order to successfully transfer HCOV to viruses, the dependency factors must be increased and the restraints of the carriers should be subject to.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can result in an impartial full-screening of the dependency and restraint factors for SARS-CoV-2 with the latest CRISPR technology.
New HCV detection: back to the zero mark
The diversity of coronaviruses by flying mice provides a wide range of opportunities for new HCVs.
In this sense, coronaviruses are a genetic pool for HCOV.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination are also the driving force of the evolution of HCOV and serve two important steps in this process.
For example, acquiring or losing new protein-encoded genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
The SARS-CoV accessor proteins are considered important for human adaptation, since ORF8, the parent SARS-CoV viruses, have been isolated, but it has been found that they are encoding the different ORF8 proteins.
In strains isolated from the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide decomposition characterized by SARS-CoV coronaviruses was detected.
This delegation divides ORF8 to ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation, which accelerates the change in carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA.
Recombination sites were also identified in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, the epidemiological MERS-CoV has been shown to have been associated with events between the various lines, which occurred in one-legged widows in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recombinant events were also observed in other HCVs in which HCV was recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genes, which is likely to result in the removal of the virus from the selected pressure, for example by the immune system of the carrier.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype strain HCOV-229E due to the dual-nucleotide distribution.
While an intact open-ended ORF4 can be seen in mouse and camel viruses related to HCV-229E, the alphacoronavirus is a single-nucleotide cartridge that results in a frame movement.
Finally, the evolution of new HCOV is also due to the pressure of selection on their reservoirs.
In the event of a virus infection by flying mice, rare symptoms or lack of them were recorded, which refers to the mutual adaptation between the coronary viruses and the flying mice.
It has been shown that flying mice are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, failure to activate a pro-inflammatory response in flying mice effectively reduces the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of cell killers in the flying mice is clouded by the pre-regulation of the inhibitor receptor of the natural cell killers NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the major class I hypersensitivity complex.
Moreover, a high level of active oxygen, which is provided with high metabolic activity of flying mice, can cause coronavirus replication while having an influence on the count of exoribanuclease, thus creating a selection pressure for the generation of strains of the virus that are highly pathogenic when entering the new carrier.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or properties of proteins for the adaptation of the carrier.
Thus, it is no coincidence that in the last twenty years, three new human coronaviruses have appeared.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms to their reservoirs, such as flyers or camels.
They're probably replicated without a strong immune response from the carrier.
This is a secret to why we see unsympathetic carriers and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with hyperactivity of immune response and cytokine storm, with the stronger immune response, the more severe damage of the mild ones.
On the contrary, unsymptomatic carriers do not have an immune response to the coronavirus.
The same immune response strategy may have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
In flying mice, there is a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, taking interferon I at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should have a beneficial effect.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3-inflammasoma has been compromised in the flying mice.
Based on this inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasoms, MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The creation of SARS-CoV-2 is followed by a general scheme of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-coronaviruses have been found, with 95% of the nucleotide homology associated with SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of the flyer, with 96% of the nucleotide homology associated with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civves and other animals on the market carry viruses, identical SARS-CoVs have not been identified directly by intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2.
Betacoronaviruses of pangoline have been detected, which is the case with homologic SARS-CoV-2, which says that pangolins could serve as one of the intermediate carriers or that fragments of the betacoronaviruses of pangolins could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining issues, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intended or accidentally created by a human.
Coronaviruses attracted general attention due to the recent explosion of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in flying mice and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCOV animal reservoirs in human transmission.
Convictive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are derived from flying mice and have been transferred to a person through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection occurs from contact between people and citizens on the markets, the closure of the visa markets and the destruction of their lives could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of the various lines of betacoronaviruses of pangolins, neighbouring SARS-CoV-2, the bangolins should be removed in order to prevent the zoonotic transmission of the infection from the product markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transferred to a person through pangolins and other dairy farmers and how this can be done remains the task of future studies.
On the other hand, the Mers-CoV virus has long existed in single vertebrates.
These camels are an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin and articles from the cheese for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels for control of MERS, as was done in the Chinese wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the periodic outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for females in conjunction with other measures of infectious control.
Since we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can occur causing outbreaks of disease.
In the world, various zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating.
In particular, coronaviruses of flying mice with zoonotic potential are highly diverse.
There is a huge number of possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonose coronaviruses, which will in future lead to new coronaviruses that are easier to transmit and/or more lethal to humans.
In order to reduce the number of extra contacts between humans and animals, the cultivation of wild animals in some areas of China should be avoided.
After severe tests, which have become SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans are required.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories are adopted.
While many flying mouse properties are beneficial for the spread of viruses, learning to keep people away from them can minimize the likelihood of human contact with flying mice and other wild animals.
In order to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, permanent epidemiological supervision is required for dairy farmers to be used to prevent the transmission of coronaviruses from animals and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep people away from the natural habitats of zoonotic viruses.
Some fragments are still missing in the head of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, if the flyers transmitted the previous SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangoline, it is interesting to see how the flyers and pangolins share the same environmental niche.
Secondly, if flying mice play a more direct role in human transfer, it is necessary to determine how people have entered into contact with flying mice.
Thirdly, if the role of a true intermediate carrier is played by a third dairy farmer, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, flying mice and penguins.
Finally, since many dairy animals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether a fly mouse, a pangoline or another milking agent is expected to be identified by its natural carriers in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its forward viruses.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Update of diagnostic criteria for “suspension cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our group published a brief background guide on the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronary infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and reliable recommendations to combat this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge were gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice were also continuously updated.
In this letter, we have responded to one comment on our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “disposals of disease” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the document “Recommendations on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19” (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the PRC.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially known as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus itself was called “a severe severe respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a brief background guide and published it on the Military Medical Research website on 6 February 2020.
This publication has drawn great attention to itself.
While COVID-19 is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven editions of the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Therapy Recommendations issued by the National Committee on Health of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have been issued, and some of its provisions have changed significantly.
Recently, comments on our recommendations were made in the work of Zhu (Zhou) with sponsors, which contained simple proposals on the diagnosis based on already available clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations and has also provided valuable background information on this pandemic that covers the world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our appreciation.
However, according to the latest edition of the Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19 (test seventh version) and the results of current studies, their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (as of 3 March 2020), for a complete analysis of the disease suspicion, one element of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease must be combined:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of movements or locations in and around Mr. Uhan and its surroundings or other human settlements, where cases of COVID-19 disease were recorded within 14 days before symptoms occurred; (2) the history of contacts with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test based on nuclear acid); (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Mr. Uhan and its surroundings or other human settlements, where cases of COVID-19 disease were recorded during the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) the history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Mr. Uhan and his or other human settlements, where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded during the last 14 days before symptoms; (4) the history of contact with confirmed diseases with groups of confirmed diseases; (3) the history of high temperature, or severe or severe diseases, or severe diseases.
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of leukocytes is normal or reduced with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of confirmed disease should be based on suspicion of disease with one of the following pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full sequence of the virus shows high homogeneity for new coronary viruses; (3) the positive serotest results for specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG; or the change of the test result negative for positive for IgG-CoV-2 antibodies, or the increase of titres at least 4 times in the recovery phase for the relevant acute phase.
It can also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020) the release of the document was added to the PCR test in real time for nucleic acid in respiratory pathways or blood tests.
The pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) issues and then in the seventh issue the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on the results of continuous work of researchers looking for the optimal set of nucleic acid for rapid diagnosis, as well as on the analysis of samples taken from respiratory pathways, including blood samples, which enhances the availability of various samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive results for specific antibodies in the disease confirmation criteria.
However, there is increasing evidence of the need to be cautious in the treatment of patients with atypical symptoms and patients without express symptoms.
Thus, the road map presented in the work of Zhou (Zhou) and others should be updated, since it classified persons with no clinical symptoms as a low-risk group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practices and studies.
In conclusion, we hope to obtain more direct evidence and call on readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “dissuspects of disease” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to follow and follow closely the latest recommendations made in the countries in which they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in a timely manner to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID-19, the daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.
It's the largest number of deaths from the virus per day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Disease Studies (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases were reported in registered cases, as well as 33 hospitalized patients.
All 17 deaths were recorded.
In the online briefing, director of the IEDCR Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora told us that four men and one woman had become victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of them were over 60 years of age, two were 51 to 60 years of age, and one was 41 to 50 years of age.
She also reported that two dead people were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
The clinic officer informed the local news agency Annadolu that Jaal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, was one of the dead.
On Saturday in a video statement by the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Oaidul Quader said that public transport would be terminated for longer than originally planned before the next Saturday.
Public transport has been stopped since 26 March and should be resumed on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of first-needed goods — drugs, fuel and food products — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were recorded in Bangladesh on 8 March in two persons who returned from Italy, as well as in women from one of them.
As early as 19 March, these three men were already cured.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeded the millions of cases of infection worldwide
According to the University of Jones Hopkins, on Thursday, the total number of cases of coronary infection SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million.
The COVID-19 coronavirus killed at least 52,000 people.
Rwanda occurred on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi and Zambia was the first case of coronavirus death.
North Korea claimed that as a quarter, it was one of the few countries in which there were no cases of coronary infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported on 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 C.E. (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronary infection were reported, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to data from the University of Jones Hopkins, reported that more than 1,000 deaths caused by coronary infection occurred in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced a strengthening of measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, the Moscow mayor Sergei Sobianin extended the regime of self-insulation of the city by 1 May.
Former President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would receive a salary throughout the country, despite self-insulation, by 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted for an extension of the emergency for 15 days; results of the vote: 215 votes “for”, 10 abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended the mandate time in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina for the full day, while the previous mandate time lasted from only 3 hours until 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce a command clock from 10 o'clock to 4 o'clock in the morning.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike Dewein, announced that the regime of home self-inclusion in the state was extended by 1 May.
Stores in Australia limit the number of packages of toilet paper to be purchased once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian Woolworths and Coles stores reduced the number of toilet packages, which can be purchased once in all country stores, to two and one packages respectively.
ALDI also imposed a limit on one package on Monday.
These restrictions were reported in cash statements as well as on the Facebook website.
It is reported that citizens began to make urgent stocks because of the assurance that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of a general self-insulation regime.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the number of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, 4 and 5 March respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this number of 4 packages.
The Coles network, in its press release of 8 March, reported that with the introduction of restrictions on four packages, “the toilet paper is still too fast in many stores – one delivery over an hour,” and called such a question “unprecedented”, while ALDI, a Facebook post published on Tuesday, called such a “unprecedented” trend.
According to the representative of Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the number of two packages last week.
In order to meet the deficit, Coles began to order larger parties from suppliers and to increase the supply frequency, Woolworths ordered additional parties while ALDI made stocks for the special share of the early sale on the media.
Russell Cimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Riddlers, reported that the Riddlers were trying to fill up stocks, but this was difficult because of the local authorities ' restrictions on the schedule of freight cars.
It is expected to increase the productivity of the product, as suppliers are trying to meet demand, but there are fewer and fewer positive proposals available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, due to the disposal of stocks, some stores could not conduct media operations.
In the report of News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert on retail trade at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores are filling up stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper was a bulk product, so the number of warehouses was small, and after the sale of the entire volume, long series of poles remained empty, increasing the sense of lack of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the poles could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these poles in large quantities, buyers probably wouldn’t panic,” says Russell Cimmerman.
In the past, the manufacturer of the processed toilet paper who gave a crap reported the end of the stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also Sorbent brand manufacturers, reported that they work round-the-clock to ensure a sufficient quantity of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate sales site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne was reduced because of the lack of buyers on the weekday of the Work Day, some real estate sellers began to offer the first auction participants a free toilet paper.
The fourth daily issue of NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab for cutting and use as a toilet paper.
According to the ABC Australia report of 3 March, the shops were reluctant to impose restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased at the outset, claiming that they were not planning to do so.
Russell Cimmerman added that other products also benefit from increased demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, gallantries, hand milling and torture.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, on Sunday evening, it was observed that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres's toilet paper by two packs of 12 roulettes.
The World Health Organization announces the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of COVID-19 infection caused by coronal virus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term “Pandemia” refers only to the extent of the disease, rather than to the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that Governments must take measures:
“All countries are still in a position to influence the development of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, cure, isolate the sick, track the occurrence of the disease, and mobilize their citizens,” explained WHO Director General Tedros Adana Gebrez.
“We are deeply concerned about both the worrying level of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inactivity.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented”.
In his interview with CNN in February, he said that “no respiratory virus other than flu has been traced from its occurrence to continuous global distribution”.
Mr. Gabriels expressed a similar view, he said, “We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronary virus.
We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before."
First, in January, WHO announced the outbreak of this emergency in the area of public health, which is of international importance, and then granted it a new status — pandemic.
The Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Faci, said: “This is only the beginning, it will be worse”.
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases were registered on Thursday, with more than 4,600 deaths.
Pandemia coronavirus 2019-2020 is currently present in the Pandemia of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a severe severe respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Uganda, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020 the emergency situation of international public health significance was announced, which was subsequently recognized by the pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were registered in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people were cured.
China's mortality rate is 4 per cent, while it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include nausea, cough and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and severe respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it can also range from two to fourteen days.
No specific vaccine or treatment is currently available.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive; the recommended preventive measures include the washing of hands, covering the mouth in the cough, observing the distance between people, identifying and ensuring the self-insulating of people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world responded to the situation by introducing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, command clocks, workplace risk control and closures.
The pandemic has led to a serious global socio-economic impact, transfer or abolition of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as a widespread lack of goods added to panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world ' s students.
On the Internet, there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people who remember them outside, as well as other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of virus proliferation are noted.
The reduction in the number of trips and closures of heavy industry has reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of the city of Uhan (the capital of the province of Hubei), China, reported the occurrence of pneumonia for an unknown reason and an investigation of the situation was initiated in early January 2020.
Infectious cases were mainly related to the Atlantic Ocean product market, which is why the virus is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus caused by the outbreak of the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a recently-opened virus that has a high level of coronaviruses of mice, pangoline coronary viruses and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease occurred on 1 December 2019 and that the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the infections registered in December 2019 were relevant to this market.
On 13 March 2020, in the publication of the South China office Morning Post, whose information was not verified, it was suggested that the first infection occurred with the 55-year-old resident of the province of Hubei on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had declined but it had suddenly grown in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside China for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.
The number of cases of disease may be significantly reduced, in particular due to a number of cases with poorly-expressed symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases of infection among young people were registered, with patients under 19 years of age and younger, accounting for less than 2.4 per cent worldwide. The United Kingdom's Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Wallans estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until the establishment of effective group immunity in the country.
Statistics include cases of infection of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been positive under official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, an official policy was adopted that required no test with only minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March showed that up to 23 January, 86 per cent of cases of COVID-19 infection were not detected in China and that unregistered diseases were a source of infection for 79 per cent of cases recorded.
The statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy was significantly higher than the number of cases recorded.
The initial estimates of baseline reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention provides that this figure may be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients are well cured.
In other, more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the moment of death was between 6 and 41 days, the most frequent 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths occurred in persons over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of those killed had side-effects, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official data on mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic usually included information on deaths of patients with positive results of COVID testing performed in accordance with official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take into account dead people who have not been tested, for example, in the case of death at home, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
The incomplete data on Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID levels 4-5 times.
The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Press Secretary admits: “We know that [the reported number of deaths] is below actual.” His words are confirmed by reports of some single cases in the U.S... Such incomplete data are often encountered in pandemics such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death was registered in Uganda on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China was registered in the Philippines on 1 February and outside Asia on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than ten deaths were recorded outside China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions in all continents, except Antarctica, reported death cases; several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators differ depending on the region and the time of spread of the disease; they also affect the level of testing, the quality of the health systems used in treatment schemes, the time since the outbreak of the disease and the population parameters, such as age, sex and overall health status.
According to statistics from the University of Jones Hopkins, as at 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97,039,1 617 204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality rate for disease was reduced from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the determination of the percentage of mortality due to disease (CFR) - the percentage of diagnosed patients dying from disease and the percentage of death from infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and non-diagnosed) patients dying from disease.
These statistics are not related to a specific time period and reflect the indicators of certain populations from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators by specific groups of people.
According to the Oxford University Medical Evidence Centre, the mortality rate from this pandemic is generally 0.1 to 0.39 per cent.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first arbitrary COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analysing the impact of CFR testing.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be monitored.
The peak and the exact length of the blast shall not be determined and may vary according to location.
Macie Bonnie, a member of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrolled outbreaks usually come to a salary, and then when the number of available carriers is over, they start to disappear.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.”
The Senior Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, Jun Nanishan, states that “all can end by June” if all countries are able to mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 would “circulate perhaps within a year or two”.
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Nil Ferguson, “until a vaccine (possible, 18 months or more) is established”, physical remotement and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, a member of the University of Vanderbilt, says: “I don’t think this coronavirus will ever disappear at all, because it’s so easily transmitted,” and that it “can turn into a seasonal disease every year. ”
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and degree of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may carry a disease without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88 per cent) and dry cough (68 per cent).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, spleen formation, swelling, swelling, muscle and system pain, throat pain, headache, swelling, redness, blood clots, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO claims to be seriously ill with the development of respiratory problems of about six persons.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list urgent symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, constant pain or feeling in the chest, sudden feeling of unconsciousness, difficulty in breathing and breathing, or loss of face or face. If these symptoms occur, medical attention should be immediately sought. Further development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, sepsis, shock and death.
In some infected people, the disease may occur suddenly, without any clinical manifestations, but the results of the analysis confirm the infection, and physicians recommend that patients who are in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed should be carefully monitored and examined for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of unsymptomatic flow of the disease varies from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The usual incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; it usually occurs for five days. There is no complete clarity on the symptoms of confusion: the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed the symptom was 30 per cent and then fell to 15 per cent.
Some details on how to spread the disease are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is transmitted mainly during close contact, as well as through small drops of air with the cough, choking or conversation; close contact means contact within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, the caps can be extended from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small air droplets that can remain in the air for a longer period of time. Respiratory droplets can also be formed when out of the air, including during the conversation, although the virus is usually not transported by air.
The caps can fall into the mouth or nose of a number of people, as well as into the easy.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (SLD), may lead to the spread of respiratory products and therefore to the spread of the virus into the air.
It can also penetrate into the body if the person is concerned with the contaminated surface, including the skin, with a subsequent attachment to his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus can be transmitted through the faeces, but the risk of this method of transmission is considered low.
The Government of China denied the possibility of fecal and oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus was most infected within the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although its spread may occur both before symptoms occur and at later stages of the disease.
There have been cases of positive tests in three days before symptoms were observed, and this refers to the possibility of transmission of the virus to express symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratory confirmed cases of unsymptomatic flow of disease, but in some countries the cases of transmission of disease from unsymptomatic carriers have also been identified.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that until it is quite clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one of the patients is usually infected by 2-3 others.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on the stainless steel (304) the virus can live up to three days, on the cardboard surface for one day, and on the copper surface for up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature, and positive results have been obtained from domestic and other animals on COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit viruses to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, just as, for example, after contact with other areas to which infected people could be attached.
The severe acute coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first discovered in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uganda.
All of the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in family coronaviruses. Outside of the human body, the virus can be destroyed by means of a home mill that dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 has a great similarity to the original SARS-CoV virus.
He's supposed to have a zoonotic origin.
The genetic analysis of coronavirus showed that it is genetically classified with the genus Betacoronavirus, the subfamily of Sarbecovirus (Celtic Line B) along with two other strains of flying mice.
At the global level, it is 96% identical to other models of mouse coronavirus (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, the Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the sequence of pangoline and human viruses.
The full-length comparison to the present day showed that the highest percentage of parity (92 per cent) is between the pangoline coronary virus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that the pangoline is the intermediate host of the virus.
The virus may be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although ultimately this should be confirmed by an analysis of the polymeric chain reaction with the reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of the infected secret or computer tomography.
The results of the study comparing PCR and CTC methods in Uganda showed that CT was much more sensitive than PCR, although not specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease-related processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CTC for boxing or as a method of testing the first line in the COVID-19 diagnosis”.
WHO published several RNA test protocols on SARS-CoV-2, and the first was published on 17 January.
A real-time polymerized chain response test (RT-PCR) is conducted.
It can be carried out on breath samples and blood samples.
The results are usually prepared for a period of several hours to a few days.
The test is usually used for the test, although it can also be used for the test. A number of laboratories and companies develop serological tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them proved to be sufficiently accurate to obtain approval for universal application.
In the United States, the serological test developed by Cellex was approved for use in urgent cases only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of visualization of symptoms on X-rays and computer tomography (KT) include asymmetric peripheral mutations of the type of mother glass and lack of pleural discharges.
The Italian Radiological Society is the establishment of an international photobase for confirmed cases of infection.
Because of other infections, such as adenvirus, with the identification of COVID-19 images not confirmed by PCR tests, there is limited clinical specification.
China had conducted a large study comparing the results of the CTC of the breast cell and testing of the PCR, and it was found that, although the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be decrypted more quickly; they were also more sensitive, and therefore the diagnostic method could be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.
In order to diagnose the virus using X-rays and computer tomography, virtual neural networks were developed based on artificial intelligence.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include the maintenance of general personal hygiene, washing of hands, avoiding eye contact, nose or mouth with dirty hands, use in coughing or swallowing socks, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already have been infected should wear a medical mask in human areas.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that people be physically separated; many Governments recommend refraining from any emergency trip to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restricting the movement of citizens.
However, the virus has been able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is distributed to the population, some of which do not know where or how they have been infected. Medical workers who care for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions in contact with other people and the means to protect their eyes.
The use by Governments of data on the location of citizens through their mobile phones to this end has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty) and more than 100 other organizations have made statements requiring that this type of observation be limited to people.
Various mobile applications have been developed and proposed for voluntary use; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked on the development of personal data-confidential solutions, such as the registration of the user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test has been positive, he will receive the relevant notification. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection — for example, nose and mouth, which are actually ineffective.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working on its establishment.
To prevent the spread of the disease, hand milling is recommended.
The CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or with severe hands contamination, as well as before the meal, after swallowing, coughing or smoking.
This is necessary because, while the virus is outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic mold that covers its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends the use of disinfectants to treat alcohol-based hands with at least 60 per cent of alcohol content.
WHO recommends avoiding eye, nose or mouth contact with dirty hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated by a number of solutions (on the surface of the stainless steel disinfectant, the disinfectant begins to operate a minute after administration) containing 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrochloric acid and 0.2-7.5% iodine-iodine.
Other components, such as benzene chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that in case of suspicion of COVID or its confirmation in an establishment, such as an office or a living room, all spaces such as offices, toilets, general facilities, electronic equipment, such as panels, sensory screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that the mouth and nose of the back of the loco or sulfate should be covered in cough or choking and immediately remove the used items of hygiene.
Those who may have been infected are recommended to use medical masks as the use of masks may limit the volume and extent of the spread of waste products that are scattered in the air when talking, cooking and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virusologist at the University of Lids, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to relate to their faces, and the attachment to the person with dirty hands is the main means of infection”. The masks are also recommended for the use of those who treat people who may be infected.
WHO recommends healthy people to wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, for example, for persons who are following a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of masks actually reduces the number of injuries to the person.
Several countries began calling for the use of medical masks in public places.
The CDC centres, the United States, recommend wearing non-medical facial masks. China has emphasized separately the importance of using single-time medical masks to healthy people, especially if they are in close contact with others (1 meters (3 feet) or less).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or in public places.
Health officials in Thailand call on people to prepare and dispose of personal tissue masks in their home environments.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from entering the street without masks closing their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has committed all visitors to the product store to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks are made from mid-March, medical masks were prescribed to be used by all passengers on trains and international buses.
The people in Panama are obliged to wear a medical mask on their way out; it was recommended that those who could not afford masks should wear them in their own home environments.
Medical masks are also widely used by the inhabitants of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is a measure to combat infection aimed at slowing the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protective measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures while staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding human places, using uncontacted greetings and physically away from others.
Many Governments of the regions, particularly those affected by the outbreak, are currently prescribing or recommending social exclusion.
The maximum number of people who can be collected in one place according to the recommendations of the United States Government and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 (in regions where no COVID-19 was available), to 50 and later to 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the collection of groups of more than two people: elderly people and people suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system who are at risk of being seriously infected. CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if the outbreak occurs in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the term “social distance” with “physical distance”, thus clarifying the objective of this measure to reduce physical contact within social links, whether by virtual contact or by physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood to mean that people should be subjected to full social isolation rather than to stay in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some agencies published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it has been recommended that you have sex only with your permanent partners with whom you live, and that you be sure that you do not have a virus and its symptoms.
Individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis and those suspected of being infected are recommended to self-insulation in domestic conditions.
Health institutions have published detailed instructions on proper self-inclusion, and many Governments have also imposed or recommended that the entire population of affected areas be placed on quarantine.
A strict quarantine was prescribed for people in high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with infected COVID-19 or recently visited a country or region affected by the epidemic have been recommended to find quarantine for 14 days since the last possible contact.
The strategies to combat outbreaks include inhibiting the spread of the disease, suppressing it, or reducing it.
The prevention of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as other measures of infectious control and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
At a stage where the spread of disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to mitigate the impact: measures are being taken to reduce the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to reduce and mitigate the effects of disease spread can be taken at the same time.
The impact of the infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections to levels 1 below. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of the infection is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the balance of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to cope with explosions include measures of personal prevention, such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks and self-insulation; public measures aimed at physical remoteness, such as the closure of schools and the abolition of mass activities; community involvement in and participation in such measures; and measures to protect the environment, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, massive screening and localized quarantines have been introduced, as well as a system of alerts on the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to those infected with self-insulation and imposed large fines on those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks and prescriptions for the accumulation of excess stocks of medications increased, and the modeling of Britain and the United States showed that there were serious problems with mitigation (slow but not the spread of the epidemic) and depression (the rise of the epidemic).
The optimal policy to mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease may reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3, while mortality is twice as much as hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
The pressure may be a preferred method, but it must be used until the virus circulates among the population (or until the vaccine is developed if it occurs earlier), because otherwise the spread of the disease will be restored rapidly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic leads to social and economic costs.
There are currently no anti-virus drugs approved to treat COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking non-receptive medicines from the cold, drinking sufficient fluids and rest can help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, patients may need oxygen therapy, internal fluid intake and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can only be harmful.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also considered for use for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and household means” could alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity-building and health-adjustment to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a major response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office have issued guidelines for primary health care clinics and services to facilitate the redeployment of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, the abolition of emergency procedures, where possible, the detection and isolation of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as the empowerment of intensive therapy by training staff and the increase in the number of available devices for HIV and cocaine.
There are different theories about where the first case of infection could occur — the so-called “zero patient”.
The first known case of a new coronary infection probably occurred on 1 December 2019 in the city of Uhan Province of Hubei, China.
During the month, the number of cases of coronary infection in the province of Hubei has increased gradually.
They were mainly related to the common market of Hoganan marine products, which also sold live animals, and one theory was that the virus penetrated into the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus had a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, the Hubai Hospital was registered with the case of a mass pneumonia of unknown origin with which Zhan Tianzin was working, and on 27 December, reported the case at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the City of Shanghai.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at the central clinic of the city of Uhan warned their colleagues about “coronavirus similar to SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenjan, were warned by the police about the responsibility for spreading lies, and a doctor, Ai Fen, was told by his bosses that she had panicked.
Later, on 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Uganda published a public notice and informed WHO of the situation.
The health authorities of Uganda reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which was large enough to initiate an investigation in early January. At the early stages, the number of cases was doubled by about seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was also distributed in other Chinese provinces, which was facilitated by Chinese New Year's celebrations and by the fact that Uganda was a transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January China reported 140 new cases of infection in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shanghai.
As of 26 March, the United States seized China and Italy on the largest number of confirmed cases of infection worldwide. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases of infection were reported worldwide, more than 97 000 people died, and more than 364,000 people were killed.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one recorded infection.
As a result of the pandemic, many European countries of the Schengen Zone have restricted their free movement and established border controls.
National response measures included measures to prevent the spread of disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory residence, mandatory shelter or isolation), as well as the command clock. As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were quarantined, more than 50 million people were in the Philippines, and about 59 million people were in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion people were in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and within two days the figure increased to 2.6 billion — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Uganda on 1 December 2019; the second report, whose information was not verified, stated that the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Zhang Zisan worked with a large-scale pneumonia virus, which was reported by the Zhangan Disease Control and Prevention Centre in the city of Huhan on 27 December.
The initial genetic testing of patients on 27 December 2019 showed that SARS is such a coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Uganda published the relevant public notice.
WHO was notified on the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned a doctor in Uganda about the responsibility for the “dissemination of rumors” of the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of the re-detected virus being transmitted from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to stop the spread of the virus, which was later called the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, China, by the “national war”.
The events of “the very large-scale quarantine in the history of humanity” have been unfolded on 23 January as a sanitary border and as a ban on entry into and return to Uganda, the measure has then spread in total to 15 cities in the province of Hubei and has reached a total of about 57 million people.
In the city, the use of personal transport was prohibited.
Celebrations for China's New Year (January 25) have been cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Huosnishan, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Leishnishan, was built, which had been taken by other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built Chinese hospitals, 14 other agencies in Uganda, such as conference centres and stadiums, have also been reinvigorated in temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government adopted additional measures to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health reports for travellers and the extension of the Chinese New Year's celebration.
Universities and schools were closed all over the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions, the Chinese authorities have introduced a remote working regime.
There were restrictions on travel in and outside the province of Hubei.
The timetable for public transport was changed and the museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
In many cities, citizens' movement control has been introduced and it has been estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) have faced some form of open air restrictions, and after the outbreak in the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, there was a 14-day mandatory quarantine in Beijing for all international travelers entering the city. As of 23 March, only one case of transmission of the infection within the country, which occurred five days before, was recorded by a person returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, the Chinese Prime Minister Li Ketán reported that the spread of domestic diseases was largely halted and the outbreak in China was under control.
On the same day, travel restrictions were lifted in Cuba, except for Uganda, two months after the closure of the province of quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that the entry of visas or residence permits would be suspended as of 28 March.
Those wishing to come to China will have to make statements for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on businesses and factories to resume their work and to provide companies with a package of cash-credit incentives. At 10 a.m., a three-minute national “minute silence” was held, which opened a day of mourning for the victims of the coronary virus, announced by the State Council and co-sponsored by the Quinminan holiday, but the Central Government asked citizens to pay tribute to the deceased online, respecting physical distance to avoid the re-inflation of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 was extended to the territory of South Korea from China on 20 January 2020.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of disease, which occurred in many cases because of the fact that a large number of followers of the new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus Shinchhandji, were gathered in Togo.
The followers of Shinchhandji arrived at Tegu from Uganda, which is probably a source of explosion.
As of 22 February, of the 9,336 followers of the church 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported symptoms of disease. On 23 February 2020, the highest level of anxiety was announced in South Korea.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were registered in Korea on 28 February, and the rate has increased to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were placed in quarantine after the analysis confirmed the existence of a virus.
The explosion had an impact on the number of flights, and consequently, the schedule of airlines had been changed. South Korea had launched a programme to protect the population from the virus, track contacts and provide quarantine for contact persons, which was considered to be the largest and the best in terms of its organization worldwide.
The screening methods included mandatory reporting of their symptoms through a mobile app to all foreign arrivals, head-to-head virus testing, which had been prepared for the next day, as well as increased testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
The South Korean programme is considered to be successful in combating the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that the entire city has not been isolated.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that have either praised the President ' s actions or called on Mr. Moon to give an impression that the Government ' s response to the outbreak of the disease was inadequate.
On 23 March, it was reported that the lowest total number of infections per day was recorded in South Korea within four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that as of 1 April, all newly arrived from the border would be placed on a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, on 1 April, 121 countries were being tested in South Korea.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kum, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people were killed later that day.
The Government ' s first steps included the abolition of concerts and other cultural and sporting activities, Friday ' s prayer, as well as the closing of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rays to combat the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not intend to quarantine all areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be placed on quarantine.
In March, plans to limit international travel were announced, but the intensive movement between cities continued before the Persian New Year.
The Shiite shrines in Kum were open to pilgrims by 16 March 2020, and Iran became the center for the spread of the virus after China in February.
In the light of the declarations of the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries linked the occurrence of the outbreak to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the extent of the outbreak there may be more serious than 388 cases registered by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members reported on 3 March had positive results for the virus.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch (“In the custody of human rights”) called on the Iranian prison to release human rights defenders detained for peaceful inconsistency and to release all prisoners under this category temporarily.
The Organization claims that there is an increased risk of the spread of virus in closed facilities, such as prisons where adequate medical care is lacking.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day — the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 active or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died.
By March 23, Iran had registered 50 new cases of coronary disease every hour, and every ten minutes, one new death from the coronary virus.
According to the WHO representative, the level of disease in Iran may be five times higher than the data reported at the official level.
It is also expected that the United States sanctions against Iran could affect the country ' s financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has requested relief from economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease had fallen into the territory of Italy, when two Chinese tourists tested in SARS-CoV-2, which was made in Rome, had a positive result.
The number of cases of infection has grown rapidly, which has led the Italian Government to stop all flights to China and China and to declare an emergency.
The unassociated COVID-19 infection cluster was later discovered, and 16 confirmed cases were registered in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree to prevent the outbreak, which imposed on the quarantine of more than 50,000 persons from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “Enter the area of the outbreak of the disease and exit from it will be covered.
In those areas, it was already planned to suspend the work of enterprises and to abolish sporting activities. On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered all schools and universities throughout the country, as 100 people had already been killed in Italy.
All major sporting events, including the A series football matches, were to be held through closed doors by April, but on 9 March all sports activities were postponed for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered that almost all commercial activities be suspended and that businesses be closed with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Rehabilitation and Intensive Therapy (SIAARTI) issued recommendations on medical ethics regarding the regularization of medical care procedures that might be required.
On 19 March, Italy seized China on the level of coronavirus mortality, taking the first place in the world, following the announcement of 3,405 deaths.
On 22 March, it became known that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronary infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of healing, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report notes that such a high level of mortality in Italy can contribute to the combination of two factors, a large number of older citizens of the country and the lack of access to the survey of all who are more than the crown virus to date.
The United Kingdom responded to the virus most peacefully from all affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British Government did not oblige citizens to comply with any form of social distance or quarantine.
On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending refraining from all travel and social contacts that are not of primary importance, offering people the opportunity to work from home and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment institutions, such as pubs and sports clubs, should be closed as soon as possible and promised to pay up to 80 per cent of the salary, but not more than 2,500 pounds per month as measures to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent measures on social distance, preventing more than two people from meeting and limiting the travel and active rest on fresh air than the extreme need.
Unlike the previous measures, these restrictions were imposed by the police, the imposition of fines and the destruction of human graves.
Most of the enterprises were ordered to close, except for enterprises that provide “living activities of the population”, including supermarkets, pharmacys, banks, business shops, car parks and garages.

Nevertheless, the testing of the population in the United States was not started immediately, and the true extent of the outbreak of the disease during the period was hidden.
The test was difficult due to the marriage of test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, the absence of a federal government permit for the use of non-State test kits developed by scientific organizations, different companies and clinics, as well as restrictive criteria before the beginning of March that would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done on the appointment of a medical doctor).
The Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States by 27 February.
The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests were conducted by 13 March.
On 22 March, the Associated Press reported: “Many patients, even with symptoms and appointment of a doctor, waited for their turn for hours or days to be analyzed.” After a report on the first case of coronavirus deaths in the United States of America, Governor J. Insley announced an emergency situation that had soon also been announced by other states.

Belgium also withdrew 100,000 unappropriated medical masks: they were supposed to have been manufactured in China, but subsequently it turned out that they had come from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese assistance was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank initiated emergency assistance operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and prevent the spread of the infection.
WHO noted the clear differences between the outbreak of atypical pneumonia in 2002-2004, in which the Chinese authorities had been accused of incriminating information, which was allegedly preventing the prevention and prevention of its spread, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the Central Government had regularly provided updated information on the situation in order to avoid the panics of China’s New Year.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to prohibit the movement of transport to Uganda, the representative of the WHO Year of Galilee noted that, although “this measure was definitely not recommended by WHO”, it was also “an important confirmation of the fulfilment of the obligation to prevent the epidemic at the most widespread place,” and called it “unprecedented in public health history”. On 30 January, after confirming the ability of the infection to move from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of infected countries, WHO announced an emergency situation in the public health system of international importance (PheIC); this situation became the sixth since 2009, when it was first applied during the swine influenza pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adana, stated that the PHEIC declaration was due to “the risk of global proliferation, especially in low and medium-income countries with no reliable health systems.
Commenting on the restrictions on travel, Mr. Tedros said that “there are no grounds for measures that are too restrictive to international movements and trade”, and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to allocate US$ 675 million to provide strategic preparedness for the low-income epidemic, reporting the need to provide urgent assistance to countries that “do not have systems to identify people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the measure of our readiness is the degree of readiness for the epidemic of our weakest reputation”, and urged the international community to “make a choice: invest today or pay in the future”. At the press conference on 11 February, WHO established a formal name of the disease — COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrish agreed to provide “the full potential of the UN system in response to the problem”.
As a result, the United Nations Crisis Management Unit was set up, coordinating all United Nations response measures; these steps, as WHO states, will “focus on health responses, while other agencies can use their experience to combat the outbreak of disease in a broader social and economic level”.
On 14 February, WHO and China had initiated a joint special group to provide the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in addressing the situation within the country and to assess “serious disease and its infection”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of response measures at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for the possible pandemic of coronavirus, noting that “until too early this disease is called a pandemic, but countries must be ready for it”.
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the extent of the global proliferation of coronavirus would be increased by “high” to “high” — the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, the Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in his statement: “This is the verification of each government on the planet to be prepared for the real situation: time to act.
This virus may already be on its way to your country, and you need to be ready," and stressed that the right responses can help the world to avoid “a worse scenario of development”.
Ryan also stated that the current data did not serve as the basis for the proclamation of the global pandemic by official public health representatives, and added that the proclamation of the pandemic would mean that “we are in fact recognizing the fact that everyone on the planet will be at risk of being infected with the virus”.
On 11 March, WHO announced the outbreak of a coronary pandemic virus.
WHO Director-General stated that WHO “is deeply concerned about both the high prevalence and severity of the disease and, at least, the worrying level of inaction in this regard”. WHO is severely criticised for a deemed inadequate approach to the concept of pandemic, including the subsequent announcement of a state of emergency in the field of public health and the classification of the virus as pandemic.
As a response to the current situation with the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanam was requested to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, tens of UN experts on human rights stressed the importance of respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Expert Group stated that everyone has the right to apply to him measures that save life and that the Government is responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or medical insurance should not at all justify discrimination against a particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health, including persons with limited capabilities, minority groups, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, persons living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, refugees and other disadvantaged groups in need of public support.
International government organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has set up a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to know the views and recommendations.
The country Policy Tracker contains information on the political measures of various countries to strengthen health and the world economy, eliminate quarantine and travel restrictions in order to help countries learn about each other and promote coordinated global responses to the fight against coronavirus.
The Government of China has been criticised by the United States, the British Cabinet Minister Michael Gowa and Eduardo Bolsonar, the son of President of Brazil, Jaira Bolsonar, for actions to combat the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of heads of the Communist Party of China (CPC) levels of provinces were fired for the quarantine measures they had taken in the central part of China, and these dismissals showed that there was a lack of response to political interference in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party from the public's anger about the outbreak of the coronary virus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lizzyan, disagreed with the earlier statement that a coronavirus outbreak had begun in Uganda, but took the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 had emerged in the U.S. or Italy.
The U.S. Presidential Administration, Donald Trampa, called the crown virus “China virus” or “Uhana virus”, saying that “Censorship in China only increases the situation with the virus that has now become a global pandemic”, and this in turn has been criticised by some commentators who claim that such an approach is racist and “abstains from the inability of the US President’s administration to prevent the spread of disease”.
The Daily Beast has been given access to the U.S. Government telegram, which contains communication strategic hurdles, apparently thought by the National Security Council, with the following reference to the strategy: “All things in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any possible way, including press conferences and television presentations." Such organizations, such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg, have stated that China's efforts to assist countries affected by the virus are part of the “propagandist effort” with a view to achieving global impact.
The head of the EU foreign policy department, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a “geopolitical component that includes the fight against peer influence and so-called generosity policy”.
Borrell also stated that “China is actively promoting the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States”.
China also called on the United States to abolish sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some information being sent to assist in the last two countries.
The sacrifice of Jack Ma 100 000 Cuban medical masks was banned in connection with US sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of transferring assistance to other countries in their own country.
There were also disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has allocated hundreds of HlV equipment to Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticised the lack of support from the European Union for the coronavirus of Italy.
Mauricio Massari, the EU's Italian Ambassador, said that "China only reacted bilaterally.
This clearly does not indicate European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, organized a shipment to Italy of Russian military sanitation, specialized disinfection and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “high-level political source”, claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was “useless or of little use for Italy”.
The source accused Russia of seeking to impress the world public at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
President Lombardy Attilio Fontana and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Mayo, rejected the attacks of the media and expressed appreciation for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
The Press Secretary, Kremlin Dmitry Peskov, stated that “by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase their production rate, they will also be able to provide response if necessary”.
NATO Defence 2020 military training, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO military training after the end of the cold war, will be carried out in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticised the Defence 2020 (Protection 2020) study: “In the crisis that has been in the field of public health today, these studies pose a threat not only to the lives of the military states and many European participating countries, but also to the people of the countries in which such activities are to be carried out”. The Government of Iran has suffered from the virus, and about two dozen members of Parliament have been infected, as well as fifteen other current or former political actors.
On 14 March 2020, President Hasan Ruhani, in an open letter, addressed the world leaders with a request for assistance, saying that his country is having difficulty in combating the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets in connection with sanctions imposed against Iran. The epidemic has called on the United States to adopt social policies distributed in other countries, including the introduction of a single health system and child care system, paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Politicians expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Tramp's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential elections, resulting in a decline in diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticised “indivisible and passive quarantine measures” in Japan after Japan announced that any citizen who has arrived from South Korea will be placed on a two-week quarantine in the places specifically designated by the Government.
South Korean society was initially divided by the reaction of President Mun Zhe-ina to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that have either praised the President ' s actions or called on Mr. Moon to give an impression that the Government ' s response to the outbreak of the disease was inadequate.
Some commentators expressed concern that this step would enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Viktor Orban the untimely right to manage, suspend Parliament's work, hold elections and punish those who would be accused of spreading fecal information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The outbreak of coronavirus was called the cause of several supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment for the control of the epidemic, the accumulation of panic products and the breakdown of production and logistics operations.
The Office of the United States Food and Drug Quality Management has issued a warning of the lack of medicines and medical equipment, resulting in increased consumer demand and failure in the work of suppliers.
There were also panic shopping in several settlements; this led to a situation where the stock of stores had disappeared from the first need, such as food products, toilet paper and bottled water, which, in turn, had led to a shortage of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the WHO Director-General, Mr. Tedros Adanam, the demand for individual protection increased 100 times.
This jump resulted in a twenty-fold increase in prices compared to the usual price, as well as delays in supplying medical supplies for four to six months.
He also called for the lack of individual protection throughout the world, and WHO warned that health workers would therefore be hit.
In Australia, in connection with the Daigao pandemic, buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This activity led to a lack of child food in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Government of Australia. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Ugandan region, as well as the high demand for food, both areas were able to avoid severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and illegal trade in critical, successful products prevented the acute food shortage expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, with small-scale agricultural production, did not test significant falls, but, in the view of the industry, agricultural prices could grow.
A lot of food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Uhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pig stocks to ensure the full feeding of the population.
Similar laws, which require food producers to preserve food stocks in the event of emergencies, also exist in Italy.
The damage caused by the world economy has affected China: according to the media dated 16 March, China's economy suffered significantly in the first two months of 2020 as a result of measures to combat the spread of the virus adopted by the Government, resulting in a decrease of 20.5 per cent in sales.
Material China is a major economic and productive centre; therefore, the outbreak of viruses is considered to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to Agate Demarai, an Economist Intelligence Unit staff member, market volatility will remain in place until a more clear picture of potential results appears.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current global growth epidemic could be greater than the impact of the epidemic of atypical pneumonia from 2002 to 2004.
According to one estimate made by a Washington University expert in St. Louis, the global supply chain may be damaged by over $300 billion, and the negative impact may last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) has begun to take “fast measures” following a sharp decline in oil prices due to China's demand for oil.
On 24 February, world stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the outbreak of coronavirus, various United States fund indices, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Dou-Johns index for industrial companies, have shown the sharpest decline since 2008, while the Dou index dropped by 1191 at the largest one-day drop since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than 10 per cent decline.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
The actions were re-evaluated because of the fear of the spread of coronavirus, and the largest decline occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a likelihood of economic recession.
The economist, Mohamed El-Erian, commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks respond faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in terms of bans on movement, closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of Governments to make no travel.
As a result of all these measures, many airlines have cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in aircraft demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional Flybe has ceased to exist.
The impact on the cruise industry has been as strong as ever.
Several railway stations and ports of passenger transport were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Choongyun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year's celebrations.
National and regional Governments have abolished a number of activities involving a large number of people, including annual new-year festivals; private companies have also shut down their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many new-year activities have been cancelled and tourist attractions have been closed in order to prevent mass accumulations of people; for example, in Beijing, the Forbidden City has been closed and traditional temple halls have been removed.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and areas of China, the authorities have extended the new year ' s canals until 10 February, indicating that most enterprises are not open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of the exports.
Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and have announced an emergency, closing schools by March and canceling the New Year's celebration. The retail sector has been affected in a global way: store hours have been reduced, and some shops have been temporarily closed.
A 40 per cent drop in the number of retail outlets in Europe and Latin America.
Diversification companies in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, in March, the attendance of trade centres fell by 33 to 43 per cent compared to February.
Operators of malls around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, equipment to check the temperature of visitors and cancel activities. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic may leave 14-22 million more people behind poverty than would be in a similar situation, but without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China in the outbreak of the Uganda epidemic.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers were housed in their country's provinces or closed in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the Government for assistance.
According to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, a coronavirus outbreak could displace 47 million people and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent. Self-isolation measures introduced in India would leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers unemployed on a daily basis. A study conducted by the Angus Reida Institute showed that 44 per cent of Canadian households had met with unemployment, and nearly 900,000 Spanish workers had also lost their jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social payment. Almost half a million companies in Germany transferred their staff to the Government-subsidized working day.
The German employment pay scheme for the incomplete working day was also introduced in France and Britain.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, worldwide.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (often funded by the State) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their staff and the public, as well as, if possible, supporting the people of art.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed worldwide for an indefinite period, or access to them was otherwise limited, and exhibitions, events and presentations were cancelled or transferred to other dates.
An active effort has been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, one more recent and growing traffic following the spread of the virus, the abolition of religious services, major sporting activities and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion displays.
The Vatican announced the abolition of the Easter Week in Rome, which took place in the last week of the Christian period of the Great Post.
Many Epaphroditus recommend that older Christians stay at home and do not visit the services of the resurrection; in some churches, church services began to be broadcast on radio, live air, or on television, while some church leaders offer public service.
The Roman Catholic Church of Rome closed up to visit its churches, times and places of St. Peter, where Christian palaces no longer appear, and later other religious organizations also canceled the services and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and churches.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the abolition of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of the kronavirus, and the temples were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned the access of foreign settlers and their own inhabitants to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or transferred, including the WEFA Championships League 2019-20, the Premier League 2019-20, the Euro-2020 WEFA, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 season NHL.
The kronavirus also destroyed the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “transmitted after 2020 but not later than 2021”. The casino and other gambling facilities around the world were closed and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast in direct air, were also either transferred or cancelled.
This has led to the fact that many games have gone online, and many gambling sites have reported a significant increase in the number of new subscribers; and the entertainment industry has also suffered because different music groups have stopped or cancelled concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as the Broadway, have also abolished all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional online events, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results on the Internet, organize direct broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; this helps people to continue to perform, publish or publish their productions.
The network has seen a number of Internet memes on the topic of coronavirus, many of which are humorous and conjure up the alarming moods for uncertainty periods.
Since the occurrence of COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese citizens and people of East Asian origin, as well as the representatives of the peoples of the hot spots of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
In the February briefings (when most of the infections were still limited by China), racist attitudes were recorded in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens, who were likely to deserve the virus or have received a fair compensation for something.
In some African countries, anti-China attitudes have also increased.
Many Uganda and Cuba reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
China's citizens, as well as its residents living in the areas affected by the virus, have been supported both online and online.
The epidemic began to spread in new countries, in particular in Italy, the first country in Europe, faced with the serious outbreak of COVID-19; therefore, citizens of such regions may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed an early petition to prevent Chinese citizens from entering their country in order to prevent the epidemic.
In Japan hehteg #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#ChineseDon't GoToJapan) took leading positions on Twitter.
China's citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report on the growing level of racist attitudes and even attacks.
The President of the United States, Donald Tramp, faced a criticism of what he called a “Chinese virus” coronavirus; critics consider it racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesting attacks on buses transported to New Sanjara by Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Uganda.
Students arriving from the border with North-East India who were trained in large cities in India reported cases of the outbreak of coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, President of the Bharatia Janata State Department, West Bengalia, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and therefore “God has avenged them”.
Later, these statements were condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, which called them “deception”. In China, as a result of the pandemic, xenophobia and racism have re-launched against non-Kitian citizens: foreigners have become “foreign Muslims” and objects to be “utilized”.
Many newspapers with free access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the coronary virus.
Many scholars have made their scientific articles about the outbreak of coronavirus publicly available.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to their research results on press release servers, such as bioRxiv.

The smuggling of wild animals and animal diseases is a health risk associated with trade in exotic animals.
Laboratory testing of the respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and methods of detection of antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by the OTCR, which will identify the coronary RNA.
This test is specific and intended only for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm enough recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serolology) can be used both for diagnosis and for the purpose of population control.
Antiquities analyses identify the number of people who have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too small to deal with, or were not at all present.
The exact level of mortality from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of that test.
As of March 2020, no reliable data on the prevalence of the virus were available in any country due to limited testing possibilities.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests conducted in different countries was quite contradictory.
Such differences in information are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which may be significantly exaggerated in some countries.
With the polymeric chain reaction of real-time transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on samples from the respiratory pathways obtained in different ways, including the nostalgia mask or wet pattern.
The results are usually available for a period of several hours to 2 days.
The OTC-PCR test carried out on throat-takers is only effective during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, but it still reproduces in the fads.
In infected patients who have been tested for the second week of illness, materials from the lower respiratory tract can be taken as an alternative by means of a catheter or by means of refrigeration products (mocrotum).
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Sharita, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymerized chain response with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) and a set of 250,000 sets, which were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a set for finding SARS-CoV-2 based on a clinical level PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
He identified the E gene, common to all beta-coronaviruses, and RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. China's BGI Group became one of the first companies authorized by China's National Drug Administration to use an emergency kit for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on PCR. In the United States, the Disease Control and Prevention Centres (CDC) distribute their diagnostic panel to perform RT-PCR in real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests of the oldest versions of the test sets has produced incomplete results due to the married reagents and the severe test area of the CDC in Atlanta; the result has been a successful average of less than 100 samples per day throughout February 2020.
Two-component tests were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020 and only after that date were public and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food Quality Supervisory Office under the emergency authorisation. The US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection on the basis of RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing for COVID-19 across the country as of 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were declared; the collection and processing of analyses should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, a COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virusology and Biotechnology “VECTOR”.
On 11 February 2020, a test was registered by the Federal Health Supervisory Service. It was reported that on 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA for the use of a test that can be conducted for 3.5 hours in large quantities of samples, allowing one machine to process approximately 4128 tests for 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency (EUA) permission for Abbott laboratories to carry out tests on the Abbott m2000 system; earlier, FDA issued such a permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepiheid also receives the USA from the FDA for a test duration of about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test using the technology for the amplyification of isothermal nucleic acid instead of PCR.
Since the test does not require a series of cycles of cooling temperatures, this method can detect positive results in just five minutes and negatives in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is currently developing a test using a monoclonal antibody, which is specifically linked to the nucleocapside protein (N-white) of the new coronavirus, and there is hope for results within 15-20 minutes, such as an expression of flu.
The March 2020 review of specialized literature concludes that “retinograms of the brain cell have little diagnostic value at the early stages, while the results of the CTC [computer tomography] may have such value even before symptoms occur”.
The typical signs identified during the CTC include bilateral sub-floor sub-floor focuss on the type of “mother glass” with peripheral, asymmetric and a posterior distribution.
Sustained domination, a symptom of the storm bridge and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
The results of the studies comparing PCR and CTC methods used in Uganda at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT was much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use the CTC for a box or as a first line test method in the COVID-19 diagnosis”. As of March 2020, the CDC initial box recommends that the PCR method be used.
A partial immune response to infection is expressed in the manufacture of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after 7th day of symptoms, to identify immunity and to carry out population control. Analysis can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by on-site diagnostics (PEC)
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform highly automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each system.
A peripheral blood sample is usually used in the CLT, although serial samples can also be used to track the immune response.
In POC, one sample of blood is usually given through the perforation of each cover.
Unlike PCR methods, there is no need for a blood loss phase for sampling. On 26 March 2020, FDA named 29 organizations that have passed all necessary registration procedures and can now pass their tests on to the antibody.
As of 7 April 2020, the FDA has approved only one emergency release test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European permits for the use of their test kits that can be identified in IgG and IgA antibody blood samples capable of combating the virus.
The test output is several hundred samples for several hours and therefore this method works much faster than the normal PCR analysis of the viral RNA.
The antibodies can usually be detected within 14 days of the infection, and in early April, Britain found that none of the kits it acquired for the antibody analysis did not produce satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a schedule was developed to allow patients with a suspected virus to stay at home: “The emergency staff will pass the sample sample to the patient,” the patient floats, returns and receives the test results for some time. The British NHS announced the launch of its pilot case testing in the home environment, which addresses the risk of infection by other visitors of the clinic, or the need to disinfect the emergency machine if used for the patient’s transport. In the case of suspicious cases, the medical worker will take an analysis using all appropriate precautions.
The Express Test Centres helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and widest testing procedures than in any other country. On 2 March, the German National Association of Doctors of Compulsory Medical Insurance stated that they were ready to conduct some 12,000 tests a day in ambulatory conditions and only 10,700 tests a week earlier.
If the survey is designated as a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to President Robert Koh, Germany's overall test productivity is 160,000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, it was proposed to carry out an express test in several major cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests submitted to Germany was unknown as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that as a calendar week 12/20 on SARS-CoV-2 a total of 483 295 analyses were taken up to week 12/20, including 33 491 samples (6.9%) of the results were positive. Israeli Clinics Technion and Rambam Hospital had developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, pooling samples and conducting further analyses only if the combined sample showed positive results. On 5 February 2020, BGI was opened a temporary laboratory at 2000 square meters on the detection of emergencies called “Ho-Jan” (the combined sample) (the combined sample showed positive results).
The construction of this laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Van Xiam and completed in only 5 days; the modeling showed that if the laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of disease in Hubea would have been 47 per cent higher, and therefore quarantine costs would also have been twice as high.
The Huo-Jan laboratories in Shanghai, Tianzin, Beijing and Shanghai were immediately opened after the opening of the laboratory in Uganda, a total of 12 cities in China.
By 4 March 2020, the daily total capacity ratios were 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays, which could test up to 1,222 COVID19 patients using only 93 samples, were released in small laboratories, except for the use of robotic fluid manipulators.
By March, due to the lack of and lack of reagents, mass testing in the EU, Britain and the United States had become problematic.
As a result, some authors have referred to test specimens, which provide for the heating of samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes in order to release RNA genes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that coronavirus testing by the United Arab Emirates per capita is currently higher than that of any other country, and most of the population will soon be tested.
This was due to the ability of the expression test, along with the acquisition of the Group 42 and the BGI mass testing laboratory (based on their Hoo-Jan emergency detection laboratory in China).
This 14-day laboratory is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the world's first so large-scale laboratory operating outside China.
Various testing options were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of test kits that are sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own sets.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Sanitary and Epidemiological Centres was not available until 28 January, which resulted in a lack of testing kits in the United States.
And here in South Korea, experts say, the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has been working on providing testing opportunities, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for greater development of testing programmes as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increase in the demand for rapid virus proliferation, many U.S. private laboratories, in which hundreds of thousands of samples have been collected, were overloaded, and the stockpiles for the removal of the brain and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by CDC had “deficit”, and for this reason the Government removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of these sets were incorrect.
The company explained that due to the inaccuracies of the results, it could be a failure to pick samples or incorrect use of sets.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would respond to incorrect results and replace them with other sets of Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test sets that the Czech Republic had acquired in China had produced incorrect results. 1.2 million test sets purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be incorrect.
Prime Minister Matovic invited them to be dropped to Duna. Ates Kara, a member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had “high level of errors” and the Ministry “did not use them”. Britain purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was announced that these sets were not suitable for use.
Quarantine measures for persons whose analyses had a positive impact on SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring of the people who had been contacted by such patients had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where for the first time in Italy, a man died from COVID-19, conducted two tests of the entire population of approximately 3400 people, with a interval of about ten days.
About half of the people with positive symptoms had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed disease were placed on quarantine.
Entry into the territory of the population was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
In the context of intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine of the 2020 coronary pandemic in Singapore, there was much less stress than in other developed countries, and there was no need to impose such extreme restrictions as forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many activities were cancelled there, and on 28 March Singapore began to urge residents to stay at home, but schools that ended on 23 March were opened on schedule.
Several other countries, e.g. Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine, but are less aggressive.
The statistical study showed that in countries where more deaths were tested, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries were able to detect more patients with poorly-expressed symptoms or lack of symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results to COVID-19 in one of 16 WHO control laboratories to confirm testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the next schedule, the indicators of the column ‘positive results’ depend on the country-specific testing policy.
The country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result in percentages than the country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the symptoms of the virus, under other equal conditions.
Hand-held, also known as “hand hygiene”, is a hand-cleaning process to remove contamination, fat, micro-organisms or other harmful substances.
The regular washing of hands with migraine in certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted orally.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or regular cold, such as eye contact, nose or mouth (i.e. smoothing of the arms) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day after which the hands should be washed with soap: before and after the disinfection, after washing the child's ovaries or changing the pans, before feeding the child, before eating, and before and after the preparation or processing of raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with gold. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, in time, and after cooking.
Before and after the care of a sick person.
After the change of the hooves or the washing of the child in the toilet.
After breakfast, cough or tea.
After contact with animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
Medical hygiene is related to medical procedures.
Half of the hands before taking medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is to cleanse hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing diseases) as well as of chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are preparing or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Hands are very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronary virus and other infectious diseases, prevents infections of the diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces the level of infant mortality in domestic births.
The 2013 study showed that more quality hand washing can lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoea can be reduced by taking simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure is capable of reducing the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular hand washing reminders can reduce the number of cases of diarrhoea to about a third, and this can be compared to the benefit of low-income regions of clean water.
The reduction in the number of cases of diarrhoea by 48 per cent may be related to the washing of myeloma; myeloma is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent myeloma and acute respiratory diseases (SPCs), provided that appropriate habits are developed in each home, in schools and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of the ORI, is the major cause of mortality among children under five years of age who live about 1.8 million children a year.
Of diarrhea and pneumonia, almost 3.5 million children die each year.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after meals, which have become a solid habit, can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention taken separately, and reduce the mortality from diarrhoea almost twice, and the mortality from acute respiratory infections is a quarter.
Half of the hands are usually combined with other sanitary activities carried out under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Half of the hands also prevent the emergence of impetium — the disease that is transmitted in direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent washing of the hands is that it can lead to skin drying and, by investigation, to damage it.
The 2012 Danish study showed that too often washing hands can lead to swelling and swelling of the skin, a disease known as eczema or dermatitis, which is especially common among health workers.
Too often the washing of hands can also be considered as a symptom of the obsessive-compulsive disorder (ODR).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important for reducing the risk of pheasants and oral transmission of the disease: after exposure (mouse release, defecation), after washing the child’s ovaries (changes of heels), before feeding the child, before taking food and before/after preparing or processing raw meat, fish or birds.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after the treatment of the cut or wound, after swallowing, coughing or swallowing, after touching the waste of animal origin or animals, after touching the debris.
In many countries, the procedure for washing hands with soap is relatively low.
A study on hand milling in 54 countries in 2015 showed that on average 38.7 per cent of myeloma families were in general practice. The 2014 study showed that the highest figure, 97 per cent, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the United States was close to the average, 77 per cent; the lowest was recorded in China, 23 per cent. There are currently several methodologies for changing myeloma behavior and practice in critical situations.
The Emergency Medical Assistance Programme, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of large-scale child health and child education activities.
This national programme is based on degelminization, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily washing of myeloma and daily cleaning of myeloma teeth.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from each cover is more effective if the milling process adds flour or waxes.
The main action of the mill and its funds is to remove barriers to the solubility and the improvement of its level.
Water is not considered to be an effective means of cleaning the skin itself, since fats and proteins that are components of organic contamination are poorly dissolved in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the cleaning process.
Durable soap may also contain bacteria that may fall on it during previous use because of multiple use.
A small number of studies on the incidence of each cover of bacteria from a contaminated lump of solid honey are concerned about the likelihood of such a decline, as bacteria are confused with penicillin.
The CPC still claims that “a dry soap with a hand doser is a preferred option for hand washing”.
Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in health-care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended contraceptives or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by their nature.
However, the antibacterial mill contains distributed antibacterial agents, such as triclosene, which sustains a number of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even if the strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to the antibacterial melon, their effectiveness may not be consistent with the advertising.
In addition to surface-active substances and skin protection agents, complex compounds may contain acids (sex, ascorbine, milk) as RN regulators, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other wastes (aloe vera, vitamins, manthol, plant extracts). The complex analysis conducted by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that in the prevention of diseases and removal of bacteria from the skin, simple variations had the same effect as conventional antibacterial soap containing triclozan.
Hot water is still not hot enough for the human skin to kill bacteria.
The bacteria reproduce much faster at the body temperature of 37°C.
However, for the removal of natural fats that contain contamination and bacteria, warmer water is more effective than colder.
Despite the widespread view, research has shown that the use of hot water does not affect the reduction of the micro-load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant (sanitiser) or an antiseptic device for hands is a hand-held non-watering device.
At the end of the 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene products on a non-water basis (also known as hand disinfectants on a alcohol basis, antiseptics for hand disinfection or sanitation) became popular.
Most of these are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with additives such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) as gel, or moisturizers, such as glycerin in liquid or pen, which facilitate the use of these substances and reduce the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
Adding a diluted hydrochloric acid further increases antimicrobial activity; disinfectants containing at least 60-95 per cent alcohol effectively destroy the microbes.
Inhaling agents kill bacteria, including multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70 per cent of alcohol kill 99.97 per cent of the bacteria (logarithm of a logarithm of 35 decibels) in the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99 per cent to 99.999 per cent of the bacteria (logarithm of 4 to 5) in the hands 1 minute after use. Disinfectants for the hands are most effective against the bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-defective drugs are practically ineffective against neurovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of the infection. A sufficient amount of anti-septic or alcohol-containing drugs should be used to treat and wash the skin from both sides.
The face and back surface of both bearings, as well as the length of the fingers, shall grow for about 30 seconds until the liquid, pen or gel is fully questioned.
The rest of the fingers on both hands should also be thoroughly emptied. The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centre recommends that the hands should be chosen instead of the use of disinfectants, especially if their hands are highly contaminated.
The increase in the popularity of such disinfectants is due to their simple use and rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be replaced by complete washing if there is an opportunity to use water and soap.
The frequent use of disinfectants for hands on a spirit basis may cause skin dryness if their composition does not contain softening agents and/or moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerol and/or other softening substances.
In clinical trials, antimicrobial disinfectives of the hands containing the softening components caused significantly less dissipation and dryness of the skin than myel or antimicrobial molars.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact dropper syndrome or hypersensitive to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are virtually absent.
The lower probability of a disturbing contact dermatitis has been a factor in the choice of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water resources do not wash their hands from organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
That is why hand disinfectants are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens, such as ordinary soap and water, as these pathogens still remain at hand.
The effectiveness of the disinfectant for non-alcoholic hands depends to a large extent on components and composition and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol.
Recently, it has been proved that the medicinal products used in the chloride of benzalkonium have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to have lost effectiveness after multiple use, probably due to progressive side effects.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to take advantage of it and replace it with gold or clay.
Zola or clay may be more effective than simply water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or gold is contaminated by microorganisms, it may, on the other hand, increase the spread of disease.
Gold is a disinfectant, as when contacting the water, it produces a slurry solution.
If the mill is not available, WHO recommends the use of gold or sand as an alternative.
In order to prevent infection of the U.S. Disease Control Centre, it is recommended that hand washing techniques include the following steps:
Wash your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that water flow, because standing water may be contaminated, and that is the water temperature is not relevant at all.
Help your hands by growing them with a large amount of soap, including the back of the trays, as well as the area between your fingers and under your fingernails.
It removes the microbes from the skin, and studies show that when using soap (not just one water) people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Three hands at least 20 seconds.
The training helps remove the microbes from the skin, and the longer the third hand, the more the microbes are removed.
Wash your hands thoroughly under running water.
Reinfection of the hands in the standing water can cause reinfection.
Wash your hands with clean hands, or let them get up by themselves.
Wet and wet hands are more easily contaminated, and most often people leave such areas as large thumbs, wrists, thumbs, and feet without attention.
The artificial nails and the crushed nail for the nails can contain a variety of microorganisms.
It is often recommended that wet linen be used to prevent the swelling of the hands that can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If water and soap are not available, there are many different ways of washing hands: pouring water out of the hanging canister or bottled type with the openings made and/or using gold if necessary, for example, in developing countries. In areas with limited water supply (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as foot-and-mouthed rabbits and other low-cost options.
It is a simple structure with a foot pedal, made up of a rope hanging from a rope and a knife, which should be attached to wash the water in the hands, and a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand dryness is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but some disputes are raised about the most effective form of dry cleaning in public toilets.
The growing amount of research shows that paper bearings are much more hygienic than hand-held electric dryers, which are found in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Solstice and Poultry; this study compared the level of hygiene of paper pilots, hand dryers with warm air and more modern air dryers for hand.
It was found that after washing and drying, the total number of bacteria in the fingertips on average increased by 194 per cent and in the lorries by 254 per cent.
It was also found that after washing and dry hands in the airflow, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips increased by 42 per cent and 15 per cent on the laps.
After washing and dry hands, the total number of bacteria in the fingertips on average is reduced to 76 per cent and in the sheets up to 77 per cent. Scientists have also tested to determine the possibility of cross-contamination of several visitors in the toilets and the toilet environment in each type of dry matter.
An air-dryer that emits air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 miles/h), is capable of detonating micro-organisms from their hands and from their own block and potentially infecting other users of the bathroom and sanuzla in a radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of warm air dryers extends micro-organisms to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
In 2005, TÜV Product und Umwelt conducted a study on the evaluation of different methods of dry hands.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed according to the dry hands method:
There are many different producers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to dry paper pillows.
Washing hands using disinfectant can be an alternative in the absence of soap and water.
The denouncing hand-held device shall contain at least 60 per cent of the alcohol.
The medical method of washing hands became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignatz Zemmelweis found it to be highly effective (in 1846) in the prevention of permanent diseases.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget about it.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps reduce the level of infection.
The medical washing of the hands takes not less than 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel for washing and spraying each part of the hands.
Hands should be carefully stretched around each other, shaking their fingers.
If there is a sin under the feet, the damage can be used to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water present on their hands, it is important to wash them thoroughly and to drain them with a dry cleaner.
After drying hands, closing the skull, and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, the paper lid should be used.
This allows to avoid re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The aim of the washing of hands in medical facilities is to remove pathogens (microbials) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the hand washing order remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before contacting patients, and thus spread microorganisms.
As a result of one study, proper washing of hands and other essential procedures may reduce the level of blood clot infections associated with catheter use by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization published a letter showing the standard washing and hand-hand treatment procedure to be applied in the health sector.
The WHO Manual on Hygiene is also available on its website and open to public discussion.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby in sponsorship.
If compliance with the regulatory requirements is required, commercial devices can be used to measure the indicators and check the hygiene.
The World Health Organization shall indicate “five moments” when it is necessary to wash hands:
After contact with blood or biological fluids,
prior to the use of antiseptics, as well as
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to myel in the hands (medical or antimicrobial myeloma) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be required prior to surgery or in the environment with high levels of antibiotics. To “clean up” hands before surgery, a crane may be required, which can be included and excluded, without regard to its hands; a small chlorohexidine or iodine water should also be used to cool the hands, sterile handshake after washing, sterile damage to the third and other sterile tool to clean the nails.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure usually requires the washing of the hands and pretzels to the elbow for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to shake your hands too long, for example, 10 minutes.
When it is cooled, precipitating water should not fall back on the brush of the hand.
After the washing, the hands dry with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical coat.
To reduce the spread of microbes, better wash your hands or use antiseptics for the hands before and after the care of the sick.
In order to combat Stafiloccal Infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from washing was the first 20% of washing, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the washing rate was increased by more than 35%.
Compared with antibacterial milling, conventional milling has resulted in more than three-fold increases in the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted through food. The comparison of antibacterial milling and antibacterial milling has shown that the treatment of antibacterial milling has reduced the bacterial contamination by 26 per cent compared to antibacterial milling in an average of 30 seconds per procedure.
However, soap and water are even more effective than hand-washing solutions, in order to reduce the amount of influenza A H1N1 virus and the conflict of Clostridium difficulty. Health care activities in medical institutions may include training for hand-washing personnel, improving the availability of hand-washing solutions, and written and oral reminders to staff on the need to wash their hands.
Additional research is needed on the most effective types of measures in various health institutions.
In developing countries, hand washing is recognized as an economically effective and important means of improving health and even food.
However, the lack of stable water supply, soap or washing facilities at home, in schools and in workplaces makes it difficult to enjoy regular washing.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are not far from each private or public toilet, although there are cheap ways to organize hand mills in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene can also be caused by rooted habits rather than by lack of soap or water.
The promotion and promotion of hand milling can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefit of hand milling and lead to long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, results should be monitored and evaluated.
A system analysis of 70 studies found that, to improve the health-care situation in lower-income countries, effective community-level health-care and epidemiological surveillance is less effective, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of the United Nations Children's Fund's Three Star Approach approach is that of promoting the implementation of simple economic measures in schools that stimulate the use of soap and other health requirements.
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can increase their level from one to three stars.
The establishment of handcuffs is one of the possible measures implemented in the context of hand hygiene information campaigns to reduce the level of disease and child mortality.
The World Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund is promoting the use of a symbolizing hand milling.
Some studies considered the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to DALYs (saved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating the washing of hands with soap is a much more economical solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of washing hands for human health — especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized by two in the middle of the 19th century in the field of hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Sammelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), working in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale (Florence Nightingale), English nurse and “the founder of modern care for the sick”.
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by disgusting smells called miasms.
In the 1980s, as a result of outbreaks of food-borne diseases and infections related to medical care, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have become more active in the promotion of hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have improved their understanding of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany around the handcuffs in public toilets, as well as in office buildings and airport toilets, posters with “correct hand washing”.
The phrase “to wash your hands” means to show your unwillingness to accept responsibility for something or to be a party to something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate “washed his hands ” in making a decision about Jesus Christ’s enthronement; then this phrase became more widely used in some English communities.
In the play "Macbeth" Shakespeare, Lady McBeth begins to wash her hands incessantly in an attempt to clean up from the imaginary Friday, symbolizing an unclean conscience, for the crimes she committed by herself and motivated her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed any non-ethical action were inclined to wash their hands more often than others, and handcuffs were more important to them.
Also, it is unlikely that those who have been able to wash their hands after seeing them will participate in any other “cleaning” compensatory activities, such as voluntary activities.
In religions, the washing of hands has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. The symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap, is a part of the ritual provided for in many religions, including Bahiaism, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygienic washing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam are required to wash their hands after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
The control of the production factors related to COVID-19 implies the use of methods to ensure safety of work and health in order to control the risk and control of coronal virus in 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper risk control at the workplace depends on the place and the job, based on the risk assessment, the severity of the community epidemic and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Office for Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) reported that low-risk posts have minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures are required to combat infection, including hand milling, to encourage workers to stay at home with signs of disease, to observe the respiratory label, and to carry out daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The medium risk functions require frequent or close contact with persons who do not have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, but are likely to be infected with the current prevalence of disease in society or during international travel.
Such a category may include public-contact workers, such as schools, the working environment with high population density and some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to the basic measures to prevent infection, include air-conditioning using high-efficiency air filters, the use of protective screens and available personal protection in the event of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that medical personnel and morgues in contact with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of a COVID-19 infection are at high risk, while the risk is increased to a very high level in the conduct of procedures with aerosol education, or the collection/processing of human samples with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such staff include the use of engineering and safety equipment, such as ventilating rooms with negative pressure, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task.
The explosion of COVID-19 can have different types of effects on the workplace.
Workers may not be at work because of their own illness, the need to care for others or because of the fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns may change with respect to both the types of goods on which demand is made and the means by which such goods are acquired (e.g. purchases in non-peak periods with delivery or maintenance without leaving the car).
Finally, the delivery of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19 may be affected. The Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan can be used to provide protection.
The plans address the risks associated with different workplaces and tasks, including the sources of infection, the risk factors arising from home and communities, as well as the risk factors of individual workers, such as age or chronic diseases.
Plans also identify the means of control necessary to address such risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Plans for preparedness for the epidemic and response may be subject to national or state recommendations.
Some of the objectives for response to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus to staff, protect people at higher risk of serious health difficulties, maintain business operations and minimize the negative impact on other organizations in their supply chains.
Responses affect the severity of the diseases in the community where there is business.
The risk control hierarchy is a structure widely used in safety and health at work to group such funds according to efficiency.
In the absence of the possibility of eliminating the risk of COVID-19, the most effective engineering and technical means of safety, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.
The engineering and technical means of safety mean the isolation of staff from workplaces and do not rely on the employee ' s behaviour, which can be the most economically beneficial solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in labour policies or procedures requiring action by an employee or staff member.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help to address some risks.
All types of personal protection should be selected depending on the threat to the worker, to approach the size (e.g. the respiratory system), to be used continuously and appropriately, to check regularly, to be properly maintained and to replace as necessary, and to be properly removed, cleaned and stored or used to avoid contamination.
The United States Office for Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) believes that the minimum risk positions have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with the respiratory label, including the closing of the mouth with cough and choking, the provision of slabs and containers for debris, the willingness to work away or change, where necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as the conduct of daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of persons who may be potentially infected is a critical step towards the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others at work.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that staff with severe respiratory symptoms stay at home until the heat is stopped, lack of fever, and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of anti-fungal drugs or other symptoms, as well as ensuring the flexibility of hospital staff policies, allow staff to stay at home to care for the sick member of the family, and ensure that staff are aware of such policies.
According to the OSHA, the risk-weighted positions require frequent and close contact of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with persons with no confirmed data or suspicions of COVID-19 infection, but there is a likelihood that SARS-COV-2 infection is caused by the spread of disease in the territory of business or by recent visits to the place of distribution of COVID-19.
These categories include public-related workers, such as schools, the working environment with high population density and some large retail stores.
In rare cases, workers in such a risk group may need to carry their breathers.
If a person is sick on a plane, appropriate safety measures are required, such as the isolation of a sick person from other people at 6 feet, the appointment of a member of the sick person's care team, the provision of a sick mask, or the treatment of such a person with a request to cover his nose and mouth with a walnut or brush.
Secondary crew members should carry once-in-a-kind medical gloves when approaching the sick traveler or in contact with physiological fluids or potentially infected surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if in pain, regular cough or difficulty breathing.
Used pens and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag and the contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. In cases of commercial navigation, including cruise liners and other passenger ships, the safety measures include the delay of travel in the event of illness, self-insulation and immediate information of the medical centre on board when there is heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should be carried out in an isolated cage of such a person. In the case of schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends that a short-term closure be made for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or medium level of infection spread in the community, social exclusion strategies can be implemented, for example, to cancel out trips to personal meetings, meetings and other mass activities, such as exercise of physicoculture or singing, food intake in the cafeterias, increased distance between parties, adjustment of time of arrival and care, restriction of unnecessary visits, use of separate health care facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At a significant rate of distribution in the local community, in addition to social exclusion strategies, long-term school absences may be considered; for law enforcement officials carrying out daily duties, the direct health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.
Staff members of law enforcement authorities, who are obliged to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, are encouraged to follow the same instructions as those prescribed for rapid assistance, including the use of appropriate personnel protection.
In the event of close contact during detention, workers should clean and disinfect their formal belts and equipment before re-use by means of house cleaning aerosols or by objecting, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and the use of used personal protective equipment, as well as with the use and use of clothes.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical assistance, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel contacting patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection in the conduct of aerosol education procedures or in the collection/processing of samples from confirmed diagnostics or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures accompanying aerosol education include screening, procedures for coughing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and surveys or sampling by invasive methods.
High-risk Mortgage workers are staff who are treating people with confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if such staff are exposed, they are entering a very high-risk category. Additional engineering and safety means for such risk groups include the use of isolated facilities for patients with confirmed disease or COVID-19, including in the conduct of aerosol education procedures.
In some health institutions and morgues an effective measure may be the use of a special ventilation with negative pressure.
Tests should be carried out in compliance with the biosecurity precautions provided for 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that prospective patients be allocated to separate waiting areas, depending on the suspicion of COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personnel protection, OSHA recommends that workers who work at a distance of up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of SARS-COV-2 infection, as well as persons conducting procedures that accompany aerosol education, should be used.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved respirators for N95 or higher-class subjects should be used in an integrated written programme for respiratory protection, which sets out the requirements for individual selection of funds and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the staff. WHO does not recommend the use of a special condition, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not due to physical fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks should be used for patients' screening.
WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, protective eyes or protective screen for the person, dress and ring of the patient, for persons with COVID-19 or for carriers without procedures associated with aerosol education.
In the course of aerosol education procedures, the N95 or FFP2 may be replaced by a surgical mask.
In view of the lack of individual protection resources around the world, WHO recommends that such protections be minimised by the use of remote medical facilities, physical barriers, such transparent environments, access to a patient infected with COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, use only those personal protections that are necessary for a specific purpose, longer use of the same respiratory agent, without recording, working with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection and recommendations not to use masks for persons with no symptoms.

Theme: [Covid-19] Facilitation of load and preparation for the future
Date/Time of delivery: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
RESOLUTION: CC0: No protected rights
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the relationship between people of the world and our responsibility to one another.
We had no precedents of such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to feel, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is based on such an organization.
We have observed friendly and caring relationships among all our colleagues, as reflected in electronic correspondence, phone calls and chats — a remarkable confirmation of the fact that fortunate people work with us.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as my colleagues.
Last week, I was told of the high value of our work.
I was reminded how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible because of your work, whether it is to ensure the functionality of the sites, to pay our colleagues or to protect the safety of the communities.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and that is even more important today than ever before.
In order to achieve significant results for peace, it is not only what we do but also how we do it.
With regard to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make significant changes in the order of our joint work, starting next week.
Adjusting the order of our work and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the "c-team" team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During the communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The overwhelming majority of us wanted to remove the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to step back, it'll be like that.
For all staff, contractors and external staff:
As we expect, work will take about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before the next order comes.
We do not announce the weekend: if you can work normally for more hours, it will be allowed for our mission.
However, the world is not now predicting; whatever your needs are, whether you are caring for your family, buying food, or going to a doctor’s office, your well - being is our priority number one.
We're not following your schedule.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
It's understandable, and it's unquestionable, but we're talking about it.
There is no need to form a hospital letter or a letter: just inform your manager and help the team review the calendar and schedule of work to ensure the coverage of key areas.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, report to Brian from the T&C Ops unit so that T&C can provide support and attention from the guidance to your situation).
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and confirmed our intention to comply with the obligations of our contractors and temporary staff.
Each person will be paid in accordance with normal hourly rates applicable under normal circumstances.
This means, in particular, periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to send their efforts to the world around us.
What we do can bring wonderful results, especially at such times.
And it's about self-help again.
We ask you to contact our leader to know what to expect and to be able to adjust your actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
Such activities should always be supported.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (in addition to others) are doing critical work for which additional support may be required.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess the current targets and to focus on providing support, which is extremely important for our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we are just focusing on the most important projects.
The slowdown today does not mean a negative impact in the future.
We do not plan to work “two more to turn the lost” after the end of the pandemic.
You will not need to work overtime to meet the unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work on setting new goals and deadlines, as far as possible.
What happens to the APP (annual plans)?
In order to build on the new reality and expectations of daily working time, we intend to adjust the deadlines for the implementation of our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of the deadlines for our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, which will allow staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for their loved ones, while all who need or want to work will provide a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
Such an extension of time would significantly reduce the current planning burden and tension throughout the organization.
The following week, we will present our proposal to the Council, inform representatives and teams of relevant information on the next steps immediately after receipt of the relevant confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership in this work.
Status of office, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
In addition to many precautions, however, we have hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in the office in San Francisco.
They used anti-virus solutions of the medical class to disinfect all surfaces, as well as acceptable and elevator halls that allow access to our floor.
The building is subject to its own rules, which require caution, using products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared by the time we decide to return.
Our office in the District of Colombia (DC) is located on the WeWork network, which has been shared with us and with all the staff in DC by its rules related to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in the Colombian district completely moved to remote work in accordance with the instructions given in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the rental of accommodation in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work far away for the first time.
Our old colleagues, who work far away, are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit the duration of meetings to one or two hours.
If necessary, consider the possibility to divide them into a course of several days.
You will clearly define the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and the material you have previously distributed for the purpose of learning.
By default, use video links to facilitate interaction and communication, such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, appoint a coordinator, a person who will monitor the arrival of questions in the chat and monitor the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for the conduct of observations (or joint viewing).
If necessary, use of the convenient fitting, please contact the service for technical support by e-mail.
Take advantage of your Wellness Reimbursement program benefits when you buy snacks.
Join the #remoteties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about the distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying the ergonomics manuals available in web-based format to promote the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the community grants to cancel the mass activities financed by Wikimedia, such as “editathons”, until the WHO announced the completion of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may affect the impossibility of carrying out concerted grants activities, and no one will be penalised for delays or changes to such objectives.
In the coming week, we will conduct follow-up activities with additional guidance on Wikimania as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
General attitudes in the global community are not only aggrieved by interruption of work, but also some sense of relief from mutual understanding and the opportunity to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and not only.
With regard to the perspective, the CRT is working on the Meta-Wiki page, which will provide space for the community to monitor the impact and the community.
We remain in contact with issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special meeting of staff to be held on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07/00 PT.
This time we take the opportunity to further share relevant information, answer your questions, and spend time together, joining each other.
We are in this situation together and ready to help everyone as much as we can.
You can continue to receive information from such an electronic correspondence and other important information about COVID-19 from Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have had a significant impact on the current situation.
In case of travel, activities, key workflows, information reporting problems or other assistance, contact the CRT.
We are ready to support and communicate as necessary.
In case of confidentiality issues, please contact the Director of HR International Global Operations by e-mail to Brian Judah (Bryan Judah).
No such change should be seen as a rejection of our work and our obligations.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for the heart-to-heart adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to ensure that work is continued, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary service.
Our planning work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support each other and create an important space for work that is coming in the weeks ahead and perhaps months.
To do so, we will need help from each one of you; and we need you to be able to care for yourself and your families as well as work with the greatest possible effect as soon as that need arises.
Now, please, help your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells in light, arteries, hearts, thighs and pockets.
ACE2 opposes the activity of the relevant angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), reducing angiotensin-II content and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution to treat cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a point of entry into cells for some coronary viruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal ester located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
White ACE2 contains N-concealed peptide domain M2 and C-concealed transport domain of the renal amino isotope collection.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane type I membrane, and its fermentatively active domain falls on the surface of the cells of light and other tissues.
ACE2 is decoupled from a transmembled domain by another enzyme known as sedase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally dissolved with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cellular membrane of most light type II alveolar cells, the enterocytes of the thin pocket, the arterial and venous endothelial cells and the smooth muscle cells of the majority of the organs.
Biosynthesis ACE2 IRNC is also found in the brain, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a contradiction to ACE.
ACE secretes the hormone angiotensin I into the conjugated angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, decomposes the carboxylic condensation of phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also scatter a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, appelin, neurotensin, dynamorphine A and grylin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transporter of the neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup’s disease.
As a transmuted white, ACE2 is the primary point of entry into the cells for some coronary viruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-COV (virus causing SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (virus causing COVID-19).
In short, binding of the S1 strain of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to a phertative domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cell results in endocitosis and translocations of both the virus and the enzyme in the endosomal cells within the cell.
The entry process also requires that the TPRSS2 serum protease protein S is administered, which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent, which has led some to the idea that reducing the levels of ACE2 in cells can help to fight infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend that standard therapy be continued by AFP and BRA inhibitors.
According to the systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of AFP inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “pneumonia risk was also reduced in patients receiving AFP inhibitors who were at higher risk, with pneumonia, especially in patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of AFP inducers has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than those of patients with common pneumonia risk.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novelty in the treatment of severe mild injuries and appears to improve mild haemodynamics and oxygenation with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipolyscarides.
The men's half-life of rACE2 is approximately 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes, except for the duration of exposure at 24 hours.
Some data indicate that rACE2 can be a promising tool for people with a class-class renin-angiotensin-inhibitors (RAS-inhibitors) or for diseases with increased circulation of angiotensin II. RACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials in the treatment of severe respiratory distress syndrome.
The Annexes COVID-19 are applications for mobile phones intended to assist in epidemiological investigation in the context of the 2019-20 pandemic, i.e. identification of persons (“contacts”) who could contact the infected person.
In some regions, many of the annexes officially supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.
Several options were developed to track contacts.
This led to a discussion of confidentiality issues, especially those systems that were based on the geographical location of the users of the annexes.
The softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to register the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would pool their efforts to integrate functional support for such applications on the basis of Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, has developed an annex that allows citizens to verify whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and in Singapore an annex called TraceTogether is used.
The annex was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be transmitted under the control of the Government.
The Annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As at 14 April 2020, the annex was expected to register on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that an annex for tracking contacts was at the final stage of development and would be available for deployment for several weeks. Similar annexes are planned to start in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the use of applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether annex and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an application with geozoning functions, which aims to ensure that patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of safety at Cambridge University, points out a number of potential practical problems that may arise with application systems, including counterfeiting and potential inefficiencies in the use of only a small part of the population.
Given the concern about the proliferation of misleading or harmful “coronavirus” annexes, Apple has limited the list of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related annexes to the App Store, including only “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon also introduced similar restrictions.
The participants expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance on the population through coronavirus-related annexes; in particular, the question was raised whether the monitoring infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
The International Amnesty Organization and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for the restriction of such oversight.
The organizations announced eight conditions for public projects:
Monitoring should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
The expansion of monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by reservations on the limitation of the duration of action;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of combating the spread of COVID-19;
The security and anonymity of the data should be protected and evidence of such protection should be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the legislative level;
Protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse must be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also published their list of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing their joint plan to address the problem of continuous monitoring, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems as soon as it disappears.
In some countries, network tracking is used instead of annexes, which excludes the need to load the annex and the possibility to avoid tracking.
Network monitoring was approved in Israel.
Networking solutions that have access to baseline location data also have major potential confidentiality issues.
However, not all central servers should have access to location personal data; a number of confidentiality systems have been developed that use central servers only for communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application system was used as a basis for tracking contacts.
Instead of using a special annex, the system collected information on tracking from various sources, including tracking of mobile devices and transactions with maps, and then merged them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government not only used this information to warn citizens of potential contacts with the infected, but also provided information on the location of the public accessible, which was made possible by significant changes in the protection of information legislation that had been introduced after the outbreak of the MERS in that country.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of annexes and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering the possibility of using both centralized systems and systems that maintain confidentiality.
As at 6 April 2020 details have not yet been published.
The monitoring of contacts with confidentiality is a solid concept, a significant amount of research literature dated at least in 2013, and as of 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups have been working on confidential decisions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register the user's approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized transactions with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols for confidentiality, mechanisms for tracking mobile contacts (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that the identified personal data never leave the device and that all comparisons are made on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is involved in the development of SafePaths, a platform that ensures confidentiality in collecting and using data on the location or cross-checking of ways to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the research carried out in the “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” (the “Holiganes: How to Maintain Confidentiality during the Epidemiy”), published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform, developed by Enigma MPC, a company that developed confidentiality technologies, which was also originally based on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies to enable users to exchange confidential data on the location and health status of other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of these data.
On 5 April 2020, groups that share the same approach and use similar protocols were founded by the TCN global coalition, which aims to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of tracking and warning applications, which is a key factor in their widespread dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source used in the work of its official annex.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that, as they claimed, would ensure confidentiality, and based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to preserve confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Deployment of tools to enable Governments to create official applications to track the movement of citizens infected with coronavirus, but with the confidentiality of data
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple are planning to solve problems with permanent monitoring, first by introducing the system through the update of the operating system, and then by removing it the same way after the threat has disappeared.
Rehabilitation of the medicinal product (also known as rehabilitating, rehabilitating, modifying or rehabilitating the medicinal product) is rehabilitating the approved medicinal product to treat a disease or medical condition different from the disease originally intended for development.
This is one of the scientific studies currently being used to develop safe and effective methods of treatment of COVID-19.
Other studies include the development of a vaccine from COVID-19 and the transfer of recombinant plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 proteins that are affected by medicinal products, each containing several binders.
Analysis of these binding sites is an appropriate basis for the development of an effective antiviral product against COPID-19.
The most important targets for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, gelice, S-label and ADF-ribofosphatease.
Hussein AA and the co-authors in their pre-clinical study studied several associations of candidates, which were then optimized, and analyzed their similarities in structure with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical studies.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial medicine that is also used to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine would be included in the four medicinal products studied in the clinical trial “Solidarity”.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine tests would start in the state of New York on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate in accordance with an emergency application permit (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA clinical trials and was approved in accordance with the USA only as an experimental treatment for emergency care in patients who have been hospitalized but cannot be treated under the clinical trials regimens.
The CDC stated that “the procedure for the use, dosing or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the medicine when there is no other way out.
The Turkish study group in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Major studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University Medical School in Langone studies the safety and effectiveness of the prevention of the use of hydroxychloroquine.
China's clinical trials in Uganda and Shenzhen showed that faviravir is “one-on-one” effective.
35 patients in Shenzhen who took this medicine had a negative result in an average of 4 days, while 45 patients who did not take it had a disease duration of 11 days.
A study in Uganda conducted with 240 patients with pneumonia, one half of whom received faviravir, and the other half, umifenavir.
The Italian pharmaceutical department reminded the public that the results of the effectiveness of the product were poor and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase a medicinal product in Japan to fill its stocks and that it would be used by military resources to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Sindzo Abe informed the Authority of the possibility of buying the product.
It may be dangerous for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to become pregnant.
As a result of a study on the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir (Caletera), it was concluded that “the effectiveness of drug use has not been identified”.
Preparations have been developed to inhibit the response of HIV by binding to protease.
A group of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify medicinal products to find a connection that will be linked to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. The scientific community criticises the retraining of medicinal products that have been specially developed for HIV and AIDS therapy.
WHO included the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections.
One of the problems of anti-virus treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that may lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that remedesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and several clinical trials are currently being conducted, including two university clinics in Cleveland; one is conducted in patients with moderate disease and the other in patients with a more severe form.
Three internal vitamin C tests are currently being conducted for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On 24 March 2020, in the state of New York, an antibiotic test of azithromycin began.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to conduct a clinical study with Alvesco (cyclosonid) Tejzin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma treatment, for the purpose of its use in the treatment of patients with new coronary infections.
The phase II test, the form of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, is conducted with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of disease to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and mild complications in patients with low-expressed COVID-19 symptoms.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older, who were diagnosed with COVID-19, had mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding and do not use effective contraceptives cannot participate in this study.
In Italy there are several coagulants in the test.
Low-molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which has prompted the Italian Medicines Authority to publish recommendations on the use of this medicine.
A multicentre study involving 300 patients on the use of enoxaparin sodium at preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific focus has been focused on retraining approved anti-virus drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics, such as MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese recommendations.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been considered potentially suitable for treatment with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (receptor anti-IL-6): approved in China.
Also tests in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronary virus in 2019 (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has undergone clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could be obtained earlier than 18 months later.
In April, five vaccine candidates conducted phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of this disease spread around the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research in its context.
Many organizations use published genes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI Vaccine Development Initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, widespread deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020 there were 10 different technological platforms to establish an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platforms included in the Phase I safety study are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRNA-1273)
virus vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenvirus vector type 5)
As CEPI has reported in April, 115 potential vaccines are in early stages of development, 78 of which are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 more candidates have been reported, but there is little public information available (probably at planning or development stages).
In Phase I-II, a preliminary safety and immunogenicity test is usually performed, randomized, placebo-controlled and at several locations with a simultaneous determination of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III of the tests usually involves more participants, including the control group; at this stage, the medicinal products are tested for effectiveness in the prevention of disease and are accompanied by side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 active-developed vaccine candidates (as confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet tested per person (are still at the post-clinical stage).
On 24 January 2020, the Queensland University, Australia, announced that it was investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular contaminant that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
On 24 January 2020, the International Centre for Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine in order to start testing on people in 2021.
The launch of vaccines was also announced at the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, pharmaceutical companies Janssen announced in the head of Hanneke Schuitmäker that work on the establishment of their vaccine was under way.
Janssen, together with his partner on biotechnology, Vaxart is developing an oral vaccine.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a productive partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.

The partners also announced plans for preclinical testing and clinical testing of phase I by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that even in the accelerated procedure for the development of the vaccine, at least two years would be required.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotech company, Quebec, reported that they had created particles similar to coronavirus in partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Studies.
The potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory studies and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that the President of the United States, Donald Tramp, proposed that CureVac “large sums of money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, against which the German Government protested.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an IRNC vaccine.
BNT162 is a candidate for an IRNC vaccine; the product is currently undergoing preclinical tests and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that in April 2020 it would receive the results of preclinical tests, and their final vaccine candidate could start testing for people by autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Innovation Coalition for Epidemiology (CEPI), France, announced investment of $4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine formulation consortium with the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. The overall CEPI investment in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine is $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovo, Novax, Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers in the Imperial College, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-implicated COVID-19 RNA vaccine.
The vaccine candidate has been developed within 14 days of receipt of consistency from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of 275 million Canadian dollars for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine agents in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, for example, the Canadian Government announced that $192 million had been allocated specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans for the establishment of a national “vaccinal bank” where several new vaccines could be used in the event of a new outbreak of coronavirus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported on the testing of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 on mice, stating that “MNA introduced subunital vaccines SARS-CoV-2 S1, with strong responses to anti-specific antibodies [in mice] that occurred two weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian School of Pharmaceuticals of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential vaccine based on DNA, which may be released in the form of a nasal spray.
The DNA bacteria will reproduce within human bacteria and produce harmless explosive particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three U.S. universities pooled IBM supercomputers' resources together with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have other advantages beyond the disease prevention properties.
Another randomized study in Australia covers 4170 health workers.
The developed vaccines may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies on the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-trapped mice, other laboratory animals and low-precepts, indicate the need for biosafety 3 prevention measures in the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination of standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no medicinal products or protective vaccines for the treatment of SARS that would be safe and effective for people.
According to the research work published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicinal products for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world.
When Mers was started, it was considered that the SARS study at that time could be a standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents against Mers-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (based on DNA) MERS vaccine, which passed phase I clinical trials on humans, and three other vaccines, all of which were virus-based vaccines and were in the process of development, two were adenviruses (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
In social networks, the theory of a contract was spread, claiming that the COVID-19 virus is not new and that the vaccine already exists.
The social media quoted the words of some patients who claimed that there were patents for the genetic sequence of other strains of coronavirus, such as coronavirus SARS, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by severe severe coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include nausea, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, weight loss, and pain in life.
The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it can also range from two to fourteen days.
Most of the cases are associated with mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows into viral pneumonia and polyurethane deficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection were reported in 210 countries and regions, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people were injured; the virus was mainly spread by close contact with one another, often through microscopic drops of air in cough, shower or conversation.
Although these droplets are formed when they emerge, they usually pose a threat, either to the ground or to the surface, but not to the air at long distances.
People are also infected with the contaminated surface and then with their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is the most infected during the first three days after symptoms occur, although its spread may be possible both before symptoms occur and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymerized chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a muscle from the nose.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients suspected of disease, as well as for those who follow them.
The recommendations for the use of medical masks vary from population to population: some departments recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use, and others require them.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment of the virus COVID-19.
Local prevalence of disease has been registered in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infectious people may have no symptoms or symptoms of flu, such as nausea, cough, fatigue and swelling.
Extruded symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pain or feeling numbness in the chest, confusion of consciousness, difficulty in awakening, abstinence or loss; if the above symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately.
Rarely, symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease such as hives, nightmares, or throat pain may be observed.
There are also signs of jaundice, irritability, redness and diarrhoea in various percentage ratios.
Some cases of disease registered in China were initially only a feeling of depression in the chest and heart disease.
In some cases, the disease can progress by developing pneumonia with polyorthial deficiency, resulting in death.
It's called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period usually consists of five to six days, but may range from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms start to develop within 11.5 days of infection, and according to the available data, symptoms do not occur in all infected individuals.
The role of such unsympathetic carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary data show that they can contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of people infected with unsymptomatic disease is currently unknown, but it is only studied; Korean disease control and prevention centres (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations related to the virus during the disease were unsymptomatic.
China ' s National Health Commission began to include unsymptomatic cases in its daily summary from 1 April; of the 166 cases of infections registered on that day, 130 (78%) were rejected as unsymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both wet and mucous membranes can have a high concentration of the virus.
In the case of heavy air, more cap is given than in the case of normal noise.
The study in Singapore showed that the chapels can be extended to a distance of up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
The virus is usually not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transfer of particles of the virus to bioaerosol is possible, and the testing of air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside the human room has shown the presence of the virus RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (SLD), may lead to the spread of respiratory products and therefore to the spread of the virus into the air.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through the faeces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible even before symptoms occur, but this risk is low.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that until it is quite clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one patient is usually infected by 2-3 others.
In particular, it has been found that the virus can live on the cardboard surface within one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on the stainless steel (AISI 304) up to three days, and on 99 per cent of the copper surface up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
The mill and the powerful means of proper use have a useful effect on the control of infection: the mill destroys the solid protective layer of the virus, thus deactivating it, and is able to remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant) are less effective against this virus. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, spleen samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest viral concentration in the blood, and in the sixth patient the highest viral content in the blood was detected on the second day of the test.
Severe acute coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe severe coronary respiratory syndrome, first discovered in three persons with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uganda.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in relatives of the nature of coronaviruses.
When the virus is outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a home shell that covers its protective shell. SARS-COV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-COV.
Mild is the body most affected by COVID-19, as the virus penetrates into the host cell through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most common in type II light alveolar cells.
The virus is combined with ACE2 and penetrates into the host cell using a characteristic surface glycoprotein, “chipa” (peplomer).
12 per cent of the infected people who were hospitalized in Uganda were diagnosed with severe myocardial infarction, which was more common in the form of a severe disease.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and infractions of the immune system observed during disease progression, but severe myocardial infarction can also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities as they participate in the work of this body.
The high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients with COVID-19 in the OIT and may be evidenced by adverse forecasts. Autopsy of patients who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates in the light.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism with an ACE2-expressing respiratory cells, symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation are observed in patients with severe COVID-19.
In particular, it was found that the GM-CSF T-cells were correlated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes that gave IL-6 and the severe pathology of patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also detected during the opening.
WHO has also published several test protocols for this disease.
Polymeric chain reaction in real time mode (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained from the nose or nose mask, but the nose or wet pattern can also be used.
The results are usually prepared for a period of several hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be performed, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results do not have direct significance.
Chinese scientists have been able to assign coronavirus strains and publish their genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can develop tests on their own by means of a polymeric chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of this virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests that could identify the presence of the infection at the current time, as well as the possible infection in the past, have been under development but have not yet been widely distributed.
China ' s experience in examining the results of the tests showed that their accuracy was between 60 and 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food Quality Control Office (FDA) approved the first on-the-spot diagnostic test, authorized its application at the end of this month.
The bilateral multi-faceted sub-floor focus of the mother-glass type with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution is frequent symptoms identified at the early stage of the disease.
Sustained domination, a symptom of a bile bridge (dual decommissioning with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
There is little data on microscopic damage and pathophysiology COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological study carried out at the discovery:
Macroscopy: plevrite, pericarditis, emulsion and swelling of the faeces
Four types of virologic pneumonia may be observed:
light pneumonia: light effusion, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and multi-nuclear giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar rash.
DAD is a cause of severe respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxaemia.
Pneumonia: the organization of alveolar discharges and legible interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intra-insomnia (DVS syndrome); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include home stay, avoiding human sites, frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding eye, nose or mouth unwashed.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a walnut in a cough or a teaspoon, or, in the absence of a walnut, covering the mouth and nose of the inner side of the elbow zone.
After coughing or showering, it is recommended to perform a quality hygiene procedure for hands.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue masks in public places, in particular in order to limit the transmission of infections to persons with no symptoms during the disease. Social remoteness strategies aim at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have closed schools and businesses, restrict the movement of citizens and eliminate major public activities.
The distance recommendations also mean that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no confirmed efficacy against COVID-19 since the completion of the vaccine is expected not earlier than 2021, most of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 are led to a reduction in the peak of the epidemic, known as a “plato exit”.
The CDC also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or when the hands are strongly contaminated, as well as before and after a meal, cough or tea.
The CDC also recommends the use of disinfectant alcohol (containment of alcohol at least 60 per cent) as a hand-processing tool, but only in cases where soap and water are not available. WHO provides two prescriptions for local production to regions where such disinfectants are not sold.
These compounds use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
Water supply is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol and is not an appropriate tool for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as a damper.
Patients have been shown to be supportive of therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, as well as support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of being infected with the virus carry a normal medical mask.
Extracorporative membrane oxygen (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
In order to strengthen immunity, it is recommended that the rules of personal hygiene, healthy life and diet be respected.
The supportive methods of therapy can be demonstrated by patients with mild symptoms at early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China published recommendations on care for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, physicians for intensive therapy and pulmonologists summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various agencies in free resources — IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 is available.
For the treatment of symptoms as first-line medicinal products, some medical workers recommend making a choice for paracetamol (acetamine) compared to ibuprofen.
Caution should be exercised in the conduct of procedures where air-coupling can occur, such as intubation or dry hands, in order to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical facilities.
The CDC recommends that medical workers with COVID-19 be placed in an AIR, an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions. The CDC published recommendations on the use of individual protective equipment (SIS) during the pandemic.
The recommended means of individual protection: protective clothing, respiratory or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. Of the above, it is preferable to use respiratory masks rather than medical masks.
N95 Respirators are approved for industrial use, but FDA has permitted the use of these respirators in accordance with an emergency application permit (EUA).
They are intended for the protection of particles in the air, such as dust, but the non-instruction effectiveness of the protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends using protective face screens or, at least, making masks on their own in domestic conditions.
In most cases, the form of COVID-19 flow is not difficult enough to require artificial ventilation of the light or its alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory insufficiency associated with COVID-19 is currently being studied actively, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by means of an intensive airflow or two-level positive respiratory pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these two ways for patients in critical condition are as effective as the IDA.
Some doctors make a choice in favour of invasive mechanical ventilation of light, if available, because this method significantly limits air particle distribution compared to the nose channel with intensive air flow. The risk of severe disease for older people (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries, there is insufficient hospitalization for the population, and the resources of health systems are too limited to deal with a sharp increase in the number of COVID-19 infections in a severe form that requires hospitalization.
According to one study in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive therapy, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for light ventilation and 1.4 per cent completed.
In China, approximately 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are ultimately resuscitation.
The task of providing artificial ventilation of mild ones is complicated, as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that develops with COVID-19, and oxygenation is becoming more and more problematic.
Inhalation and PDA-supported HIVs are needed to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the light and to ensure their minimum ventilation damage, which may result in the development of pneumotorax.
In earlier models, high PKVs may not be available.
Potential methods of treatment began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are currently under clinical testing.
Remdesivir appears to be the most promising.
The development of new medicinal products may take up to 2021, but some of the tested medicinal products have already been approved for other purposes or are at the latest testing stages.
Antivirals may be tested in patients with severe disease.
The recommended WHO volunteers participate in the effectiveness and safety tests of potential treatment methods. The FDA has granted temporary authorisation for the use of recombinant plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where life is at risk of serious or direct risk.
Its application was not subject to clinical studies to be conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to combat the outbreak of the disease.
In order to enter, users must enter their name and identification number.
The Annex may identify “close contact” by means of monitoring data and therefore identify the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If there is a potential risk, the annex not only recommends self-insulation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. The analysis of large data collected from mobile phones, the identification technology of persons, the tracking of mobile phones and artificial intelligence is used to track infected persons and the persons they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government authorized security authorities to track the mobile phones of people suspected of being coronated.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may enter into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to study and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, the Federal Public Institutions of Germany and the Robert Koha Institute provided aggregated data on the location of hundreds of subscribers.
In Russia, identification technology for quarantine offenders has been introduced.
The Regional Health Officer of Italy, Julio Gallera, said that hundreds of network operators reported that “40 per cent of people still continue to move in the territory”.
The Government of Germany conducted a 48-hour schedule of departure days, involving more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersty Kalulyid, also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronary virus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: “Strengthened social isolation, loneliness, concern about health, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming mental health and the well-being of people”.
The disease can flow easily with minor or missing symptoms that remind other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common cold.
Patients with mild disease usually recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may need between three and six weeks to be treated.
pregnant women may be at a higher risk of getting a heavy form of COVID-19 on the basis of data on other such viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although such data on COVID-19 are not available. Some people may have easier COVID-19 and may cause pneumonia as a complication.
In people with the most severe disease, COVID-19 may progress rapidly in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or polyorginal failure.
COVID-19 complications include sepsis, anomalous thrombosis, and heart, foot, and abdominal problems.
Thrombotic anomalies, particularly the increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6 per cent of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, while the failure of the waiting function was seen in 4 per cent of the group.
Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to intensive therapy was seven days.
According to an early-stage disease study, the mean time from baseline to death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent, and among women was 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological studies of post-mortem specimens suggest a diffuse alveolar injury with cell fibromyxoid exsudates in both cases.
In pneumocytosis, viral cytopathetic changes were observed.
An external type of mild reminder of severe respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8 per cent of the deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were associated with increased troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had health problems; access to medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Death estimates vary according to the state due to such regional differences, as well as to methodological difficulties.
A poorly effective calculation of cases can lead to an increase in mortality.
However, the fact that death occurs as a result of previous diseases may mean that the current level of mortality is underestimated.
In smokers, severe COVID-19 symptoms were generally developed 1.4 times more frequently, and such patients needed approximately 2.4 times more intensive therapy or died than non-smokers; concerns were expressed about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of a Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who had been cured of the disease had reduced their levels by 20-30 per cent, and their scans had revealed injury.
After recovery, this may also lead to the syndrome “After intensive therapy”.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether permanent immunity against patients who were cured of the virus was being developed.
In the case of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but has also been reported when positive coronavirus tests from COVID-19 were performed after recovery.
In these cases, it is considered that there has been an exacerbation of the duration of the disease rather than a reinfection.
The virus is considered to be natural, has animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its transmission from human to human.
The study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, refers to 1 December 2019 as the earliest date of the first case.
According to the official data published by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary depending on the region and the time of spread of the disease, and they also affect the testing levels, the quality of the health systems used in treatment schemes, the time from the onset of the disease and the population parameters, such as age, sex and overall health status.
By the end of 2019, WHO has attributed the Emergency Aid Code to ICB-10: U07.1 — for deaths from laboratoryly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 — for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. The ratio of deaths and infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a period of time.
According to statistics from the University of Jones Hopkins, as at 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191).
Some other methods include the determination of the mortality rate due to disease (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died from the disease and the determination of the mortality rate resulting from the transmitted infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and non-diagnosed) who have died from the disease.
These statistics are not related to a specific time period and reflect the indicators of a particular population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced in all infected patients, the presence of such antibodies may indicate how many people have been infected.
At the outbreak in Italy, Castilone d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer living.
In the city of Gangelt the disease was spread during the celebration to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies, judging by donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
The impact of pandemics and levels of mortality is different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate was higher than that of men.
The most risky group is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women is reduced by only 90 years of age.
In China, mortality was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this difference are unknown but may be genetic and behavioral.
Gender immunological differences, lower prevalence of men's diseases (e.g. hypertension in men younger than in women) may be a cause of higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected were male and 72 per cent of the deaths of COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the United States Government has no gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and ORVI, have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women, respectively, more likely to be infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization declared its official name COVID-19.
WHO leader, Mr. Tedros Adan Gebrésus, explains: “CO” means “corona”, “VI” – “virus”, “D” – “disease”, and 19 – when the first outbreak was detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid a reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international recommendations for the prevention of stigmatization. A virus that causes COVID-19 is called a severe coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In the WHO public communications, the terms “COVID-19” and “COVID-19” are additionally used.
And the disease, and the virus itself, is usually called coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Uganda, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as “coronavirus” and “Uhank coronavirus”.
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended using the terms “fast respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names of the virus and disease.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations of the standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers print medical material, such as nose mufflers, as well as details of ITL equipment.
In one of these cases, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier could not deliver it to the required deadlines, when one of the local productions was re-profiled and able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various conspiracy theories, disinformation and fecal information on the origin of the virus, its size, prevention, treatment and other aspects have been rapidly disseminated on the Internet.
It's possible that humans can poison other animals.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, rats and rabbits.
There is currently no approved virus vaccine or medicinal products for its treatment.
Various international studies of vaccines and medicinal products from COVID-19 are currently being carried out by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial (SOLIDARITY Test), which aims to assess the therapeutic effect of the four existing compounds that are the most effective to date.
The pre-vaccination is not yet available, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine-candidates.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are entering human cells using the ACE2 receptor, and the results of previous studies on SARS-CoV are therefore used in scientific research.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to establish a virological vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to prompt a rapid immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the establishment of a subunital vaccine, is aimed at the establishment of a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at the destruction of the S-chip-like protein that helps the virus penetrate into the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is to develop a vaccine based on nucleic acid (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new method for the establishment of a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine in Seattle was initiated by four volunteers.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antithelosis has been identified as a potential problem in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
Preparations approved for the treatment of malaria were evaluated during seven tests, four of which were based on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Rehabilitation of anti-virus drugs is a major part of Chinese studies; nine Phase III studies were conducted in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate medicinal products for the treatment of COVID-19 was carried out. To this end, several other existing antiviral medicinal products for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with beta interferon, were also considered.
As of March 2020, there are preliminary data on the effectiveness of remedesvir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already taking place in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine previously used for malaria treatment was considered in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for an expert assessment of the study.
Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Ugandan Institute of Virusology recommends the daily dose in one gram, but notes that duplication of this dose is very dangerous and may lead to a fatal outcome.
On 28 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency authorisation for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine by physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The Chinese 7th edition also identified interferon, ribavirin or umifenevir as anti-COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanid was recommended for a detailed in vivo study, demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that initiation of SARS-CoV-2 by interacting with the ACE2 receptor requires the receiving of a white strip of transembraced serum protease 2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have severe limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study. Ozeltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinaemia may occur as a late stage complication of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinaemia, and as a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocilizumab was included in the recommendations for the treatment of coronavirus.
This medicine was achieved at 2 stages of a neurodemized test conducted at the national level in Italy after positive results were obtained in patients with severe disease.
In combination with ferritin blood flow analysis to detect cytokines, it is intended to counter factors that are considered to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA was approved by an interlequin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective thematic studies to treat the release syndrome of steroid refractory cytokines caused by another cause, T-cell therapy CAR.
There is no evidence to date that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients cured from COVID-19 is currently considered as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of patients from SARS, but its results have not been convincing.
The virus's neutralisation is an expected effect that allows passive antibody therapy to protect against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may also be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using monoclonal antibodies, are at the development stage.
There may be an increase in the level of use of recombinant blood clotting, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of the healed patients and contains antibodies to the virus.
