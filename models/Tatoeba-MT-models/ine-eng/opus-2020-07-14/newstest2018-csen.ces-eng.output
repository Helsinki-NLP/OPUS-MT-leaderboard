Moved by civil law issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Improvement of Coloring People (NAACP) has published warnings for colouring people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory principles of state and racist attacks.
‘The NAACP Road Recommendation for Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay increased attention to the state's travel as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the country,’ the Association states.
The NAACP stated that this step had been taken on the basis of the current laws of the State of Missouri, which facilitates the defence of racistly motivated acts before the court, as well as the result of the conduct of criminal law enforcement authorities that are disproportionately aimed at minorities.
‘There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped policemen only because of their skin color, are attacked or killed," NASA City Star President for Missouri Rod Chapel said.
"We have so far gathered the largest number of complaints."
This is the first warning of its kind, which the organization issued for the U.S. state.
Among the incidents quoted by the organization were racially motivated statements directed towards students of black skin at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a man of black skin from Tennessee.
Sanders died under controversial circumstances at the beginning of this year after he was hit by gas when he was travelling across the country and the police put him in custody without charge of committing a crime.
The road recommendation also points to the recent statement by the highest state representative of Missouri, which states that black traffic drivers have a 75% higher chance of stopping the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to warn people and to warn their families, friends and colleagues before what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People need to be prepared - they should drive money with them for any guarantee payment or warn their relatives that they are going to travel by state."
According to the current numbers of the FBI programme to report hate acts, hundreds of cases of hate behaviour occurred in Missouri in 2015, reaching a state of sixteenth place among all states.
The road warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it easier to appeal to the company for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after the States approved an immigration law that allows state actors to keep people on the basis of a violation of this law, which is intended to improve racial profiling, according to ACLU.
The travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for foreign countries, but recently the legal groups have deviated from these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
The model was killed by a chef.
Her family doesn't even have peace after 12 years!
The killer is a model Sally Anne Bowman.
The girl from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by chief chef Mark Dix at the restaurant where she was working, and she was severely injured.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then he killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched a careful criminal work of looking for a crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years for murder and rape of Sally's model.
The court only admitted a young man's assault, and the lawyer claimed that his client had found a girl dead on the street.
After three years, he was certified by the police.
Dixie said Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson had a bad night.
The killer said, "He was really angry, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"She even caught the attention of the cab driver," he said.
The girl was supposed to defend herself according to his statement, which she could, however, barely.
Lewis was gonna stab her on the street.
Dixie's version was proved to be a lie and accused him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his permanence and taste for the girl.
When he was having sex with her, he felt satisfied and had to burn his marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally was with his ex-girlfriend, they drank alcohol and took cocaine, he said to the police himself, Dexie.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her in the back and put her hand through her mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family faces other attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
In the last half of the year, he was injured four times.
There are so cruel people on the loose who bury these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," said the Mirror mother of Linda's fallen girlfriends about missing the watch with ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
The design vibrators are worth tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are neither fair nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who operates the Prague Intimity store.
You'll find design and luxury erotic help in it.
Including those from the Czech designer Anna Mareš.
It started undetectable, almost twelve years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went out for a cycling trip to Moravia.
One of them didn't just bring a bike, but the boxes also filled with unsanitary vibrators.
"Various moles and dolphins and all of them were green and yellow and just different," she tells me about the lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with another partner with the German manufacturer of the design erotic aid Fun Factory, which Martina was interested in, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the associate left to get another profession, he replaced it.
Today it operates in the Prague Benedict Street store of Intimity, where it sells erotic aid in the way luxury cables or shoes are usually offered.
Why not?
It's also about design objects.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, you know?
Come on, don't be such a puritan!
It's just a Berlin Fun Factory shop, which proposed a well-known designer Karim Rashid, served for the Intimity store as an inspiration.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than everyone used to do here.
No hidden exhibits, all made in beautiful, decent style, products exposed rather as in perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeňk Šebelko started thinking about how to get to know the Prague business where he should be and what his name should be.
The name Intimity fell in love with both of them.
"It's all intimidating and it's even, it's said, gentle," he says.
It followed the purchase of Internet domains and the search for suitable space, which went parallel to various interior visualizations.
Finally, she won the variant that spread the store into the garden of luxury and the bedroom that leads the bed.
Dagmar Szüpán from FormaFatal has prepared it for us.
We found the space in 2013.
He didn't seem perfect at first, because he's not on the main street, but that's why he was sitting in the name of Intimity again.
He's intimate.
He's in the street next to the main, so no one's looking at customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to do a trade that would be different, with brandy goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed that they even entered such a trade.
When I went to the Intimity store about an hour and a half ago, the street was empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I'd go to the erotic aid store.
I was immediately surprised at the door by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from the fashion store.
Although there's only a female service in the store, so that women don't get tired of asking for help, it doesn't mean that a man's leg wouldn't come here.
Most of the gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men mostly can't estimate the right size and prefer the more," laughs Martin over a common mistake.
These are the precepts, the experienced clichés that women need some great help, and that's not true.
So a man in good faith must choose an extra large vibrator.
Likewise, men prefer mostly black clothing, where a righteous woman is more inclined to pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
In my face, it must be clear that I don't know what's going on, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a touchless clitoris stimulant.
Pere needs a teenager in me to look at how serious a tone is being interpreted to me.
It's like it doesn't bother.
And that's not really cool.
It is at a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't think he'd be so welcome.
It's some kind of last revolutionary news.
The first revolution caused a vibrator in the shape of a sea horse.
He took care that women were becoming more interested in the design of such products.
The other one was a We-Vibe pair vibrator.
He completely erased the taboo that some men can endure, and that he sees competition in erotic aids.
"Various variants are being made," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
It's a favorite category.
In a loving connection, a woman may have in her hands a controller and determine the intensity of the vibration.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of binders.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, although then they should only use it externally.
But in Western Europe, especially in younger customers, it is very popular.
What about the man?
It's hard to tell if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It's probably a bit different.
The question is what to offer men," says Martin.
"We have help for them, too, but to a limited extent." Most of all, the masturbator is sold, in this case from the Tenga manufacturer.
It does not look like anatomical vaginary, but "sweet as shower gel or as an egg or futuristic object.
It focuses on functionality and experience in use.
In Japan, it's completely different.
It's a surprise to me.
I thought Japan would suffer a lot for erotic help, I'd say.
"It's the Internet reality," I'm told.
That whole thing's completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with the use of women.
In Japan they are totally normal for men, and on the contrary they are taboo for women."Just for the interest - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity store, sells worldwide, still forms about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs aren't even fair.
On the contrary, we're a whole mixed nation.
Definitely different from the country, such as the Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical retail client is moving between 35 and 50 years old, and "he already has some experience with sexual life, but with some help.
It will come for something nicer, more quality than a partner's life, or for herself." To get back, Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeňk Šebelko are making sure that each product is fully functional.
We also don't want to go into a particular type of bondage and latex, because we don't have room for this, but it doesn't seem to fit in here.
Such things could reflect the ones we're trying to target.
Which are people who always had to go to the sex shop because they were afraid they'd look at something like that.
Many of the products displayed on the boxes are really popular.
It is also given by choosing the distinguished marks represented.
Some of them even received design awards, including Red Dot Design Award.
The first award was the said sea horse "and it left a change in the whole sector.
It began to be abandoned from cheap materials and instead to work with health care, it began to produce other designs, different colors...
It's nice to have some Czech designer Anna Marešová standing behind the design.
I have to say that I've been quite surprised by how many people around us are buying those design things Whoop.de.doo from Anna Maresh, even though they're relatively expensive.
They're customers who're walking straight for Venus balls from Anna Maress.
She really did a huge part of her work by representing exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids can be done differently, nice, with a story.
Anna's story started as a school job.
Now it's a finished product that's also made with us.
I wanted to have a production process under control and I also wanted to know which materials and how whoop.de.doo products are produced.
Because it's not about big production, but a small series, it's definitely more expensive than a large series.
Maybe I'm going a little against the flow, but I think it's important to keep our development in the Czech Republic.
It may well be that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna later describes the situation that agrees with Martin that our company is more open.
It does not meet with a negative or negative attitude.
They're, at most, people who are disappointed.
"But then you'll start smiling." Currently Anna Marešová has a vibrator in the offer that you can let yourself make a personal message, and this year she's also planning her own lubricant gel.
In another year, she should have a vibrating egg and other news.
Health Risks
I wonder where the boundaries of what's right are.
Is there anything Martin Raj wouldn't sell anymore?
It's hard to define.
When one comes normal, the other can seem totally abnormal, so we're more of a range of brand manufacturers.
None of them will give up on some extremes.
Before we apologize, I have the last question: What was the most foolish question they had received?
Right now the week came an e-mail in which some lady asked for a masturbating aid for her friend with a birth of twenty-eight centimeters long.
So we had to write that we had no such thing.
It's still a question of whether or not someone has made fun of us," Martin says with a suspicious look.
And it happens from time to time...
The wound to Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Sztědri is fighting a serious illness.
Carl Gott's best friend is fighting a disease that robs people of all memories.
"Yes, it's unfortunately the truth," confirmed the sad information by the singer himself.
I know about my illness, and so far, given the circumstances, I can handle it completely.
"I take medicines that have the underlying effects of disease to slow down," he added, thanking him for his close support.
The entire developmental family was about to ease Karl's life.
Eva’s wife is trying to be at home as much as she can, after her father comes to the house on the White Mountain, and the daughters of the first marriage with Zuzan and Teresa, the son of Karl, Karl, aged.
He fought cancer twice and gave his experience to Slavik in order to support him in his demanding treatment.
He's got sixty chemotherapy behind him.
He managed to get back to work and tennis court and ski resorts.
"From the astrologer, I'm supposed to be here in the '90s," said Karel Bleska.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep singing words so I don't forget them," said Karel.
He's fighting the same disease now in the institution and the actress Klěta Fial.
Do you have a patient in the family with Alzheimer's?
Look at how you treat him.
The Chilean Parliament has abolished the ban on interruptions, the law of the ÚS.
In Chile, there is an absolute ban on artificial abortion, so it must not be carried out for health reasons.
"I am sorry that lawyers filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that ten people will now decide what we have been doing in Parliament for more than two years," Socialist Senator Isabel Allende said.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and, at the end of August, a new President should be given, according to the AFP, a close opposition.
The Act breaking the absolute ban on interruption, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, approved the Senate on 19 July.
The legal opposition then announced that the law would attack the court because it violates the right of an unborn child to life.
The Members of the vote on the bill postponed last month until it was examined by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
On Wednesday, the Members approved the proposal and did so again to the Senate.
According to the new legislative amendment, there should be a criminal artificial interruption of pregnancy in three cases: if the life of a woman is threatened, if the fruit is not expected to survive, or if the pregnancy arises from rape.
Similar exceptions existed, according to the Spanish letter El País in Chile since 1931, even before women were given the right to vote in 1949.
The absolute ban on interruptions in 1989 was imposed by Judge Augusto Pinochet, only a few months before the President's office left.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where the absolute ban on interruptions applies.
Others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador, there are now about 20 women on the network who suffer from up to 30 years of imprisonment as a result of pregnancy.
In many cases, however, it was according to human rights defenders of spontaneous kidnapping, which the court called murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
Trump's White House is now Socha Freedom
The unmistakable sign of change in the regime is the criticism of the soch.
The Americans could report on this as well as all the others - see the carefully refined construction of Saddam Hussajna soy at the Garda Square of Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of Trump's regime, certainly knew what he was looking at when, during a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the subject of presidential proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigrants, he expressed himself as a symbolic safe on Sochu Svobody.
It's possible to add that Miller didn't attack the juice like that.
For that, he would be thrown into the trap of the owners of the sailing ships and the followers of the Socha Freedom.
However, he attacked her importance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a poster was placed on the ground with the famous poet Emma Lazarus, up to 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller quoted Acosta as saying: “I don’t want to go to history here, but Socha Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light all over the world.
The poem, which was placed on the basis additionally, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he said himself, it's not about history.
This is especially about the invading words of Emma Lazarus, who reason today - not only calls them immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me say."
And in modern times we can better watch these "widow worms" on our screens than ever before.
Miller did not try to criticize poetry - he wanted to explain that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict on the importance of soybean is part of a major political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict on the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends who, after her death, tried to insert a poster with a poem on the base of the soybeans, knew quite well that they would be released into a high political game.
Socha was supposed to express the association of the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, namely the women's conception of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this significance: in her poem, the female character is not abstract, but has its own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of the escapes.
Confronting with a woman's imagination is a brilliant feminist gesture and a devastating attack on American nateism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the soybeans, researchers have long sought to reverse this significance.
Famous commentator Rush Limbuugh - Jan Krítiel argued in the matter of Trump's approach to power - in 2010 that Socha Freedom does not actually call anyone to the earth, but represents early neo-constructiveism, bringing the American flame to the rest of the world: “Ssocha Freedom is going ahead.
It brings the origin of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The origin is not to shed light on the way to the United States."
Limbuugh's buying it's an important thing.
The importance of soybean depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the sochu from the sight of the exhausted and lost traveler, who often after long and fearsome sailing across the ocean comes with hope in the heart of a new country.
It is literally a world view of people who look for shelter and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, he expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that's, of course, a perspective that Miller or Trump will definitely not know.
Their origins should not illuminate the path, but to stir up hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship at the 2017 Athletics: Neil Black sings praise to the Scottish members of the British team
Elid Doyle recalls when the British team had only two Scottish members
The head of the United Kingdom's athletic federation Neil Black stated that a strong 16 Scottish team in the World Championship team would be "a huge advantage for the team".
For MS in London 2017, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes was selected.
Black believes that in Scotland "something special is happening" and British athletes could learn from the Scottish ice cream.
"We are trying to understand this and adapt - we will work on it," Black said.
“I spoke to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athlete: He has something to do with what they've done.
He thinks it's people on the streets too.
Whatever it is, it's amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will strive for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 m race, while Elid Doyle was elected team captain.
“Eilid is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," said Black.
“Many athletes, whether Scottish or other national athletes, came from a room with great pride and motivation.
The passion and unhindered feelings Elid spoke to were irrevocable."
The silver medalist Commonwealth, who will compete in the race over 400 m in his fifth world championship, stated that it is "incredible", that in the British team there are 16 Scottish athletes.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
In the run-up to the Muir track, only five British and two European records have been established in the last year.
The MS will participate in running at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scottish is Chris O'Hare, who runs a 1500 m track. In this season he won the British team races and the Annual Games.
Doyle remembers his first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of Lee McConnell's team.
The team's captain said it's "very proud" to the fact that not only did the team get a large number of her colleagues, but in many cases they will also be attacked to participate in the finals and medals.
"The unusual thing about being the team captain is that I was elected by other team members. It was a great honor for me, but they know that I was selected by the team members is comforting," she added.
“I am obviously very proud of all the Scottish who got into the team.
It proves where I've moved.
They're athletes who'll think about the front seats on the podium.
And my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
All I've noticed is that we can be proud of this year's championship because it's on home ground.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and to be happy that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I've got a second chance to compete and I'm going to have an ineffective atmosphere."
Blocking criticisms on Facebook: don't worry about public function, if you don't take criticism of wishes
Our father knew about his criticism.
American George Washington loved it, but the press didn't take long to start criticizing it for anything, starting with foreign politics and ending his political opinions.
Yes, this criticism did not leave her cold.
But he didn't try to shut up.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "Freedom can be taken away from us - and stupid and we will be led as sheep to defeat."
This brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and reduced the contributions of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, she complained to the American Union for civil liberties for those acts.
The governor's employees rejected the complaint as unfounded and many 'who's interested' opinions appeared in their comments on the Internet.
"It's just Facebook," put in a lot of users.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, it is an insatiable popular Republican governor.
He can be the second most popular of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not funny.
As it is evident, his state manages with certainty its own and adheres closely to the principles.
It also turned out that Facebook is also the main means of connecting with its voters - except there is no publication of the first photo with a bare head after completing chemotherapy.
Blocking people who look at the governor's page - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by his employees paid by taxpayers - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview for Washington Post Hogan's speech spokesperson Amelia Chase defended the governor with the fact that blocking comments took place from the position of moderation of contributions.
However, using the image of Internet trolls, spammers or scattered people is too easy.
Washington Post told a number of real people that they had lost their contributions.
And that is also true of the people who speak to their chosen leaders; teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors, no trolls.
As they all stated, their comments were dubious and considerate, not rude.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani's lawyer, Md. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hate.
"I have hardly noticed that I am disappointed in his inadequate response to hate crimes and other current reports," the section wrote with comments from the Washington Post newspaper.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people are surrounded by the same theme, some people are marked for the promotion of so-called collective effort rather than being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's employees called "focused spam growth" would probably be called "obhayobou".
Modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage our contributions by blocking criticism or by reducing negative comments.
It is much more comfortable than in the past, when the same procedure would require the sending of employees to the streets, where they would collect and burn all the pressures with criticism or arrest or silence the protestors.
And that's exactly what's going on, just in the digital form.
Hogan is not the last public actor to be criticized for denouncing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump faces a complaint from Twitter users that has been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
President Loudoun County Board of Supervisors broke the first supplement in Alexandria, according to periodic judge James C. Cacherise, where she restricted the access of one of the voters to her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also expected to visit ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington’s time, the low price of mail was practically the same as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of the daily printing press began to decline, and its leader’s position questioned many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People who wrote under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote letters to the press and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents that gathered people in the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitioners gathered in his offices criticising his opinion on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he didn't shut up.
Freedom of expression, disagreement and intimidation lies in the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, they consume more data abroad than at home.
The Czechs use more of their tariffs than at home.
Most of the time, they move to Austria, but data consumption in the summer season leads Croatia.
However, on holiday they have more time to browse the web, and under the sun they have no access to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bath and smart phone in your hand.
This is the typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of dark operators at home prices.
It comes from the fresh statistics of the company O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech passengers abroad have more data available in the area than at home.
It is not surprising, therefore, that, in Croatia, where the minimum wetlands are passing through the winter, the consumption of data in this summer has fallen even to 50 percent.
In the second place in the database of the data consumed, Italy was then located.
The Czechs spend most of the minutes from Germany, where they've been exposed to many of them in their jobs and over the years.
According to the Czech Travel Office Association, Croatia visits 800 thousand Czechs each year, so is our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged a book to share experiences with mobile phones.
The record was this July 7th.
"To the data transmitted, tens of millions of photos would be added," explained the details of the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslarová.
Even though Croatia manages the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighbouring countries.
In the first place is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for a walk and an active holiday, which we do not have so much time for browsing the Internet.
"More than that, the Czech Republic is heading to the Adriatic," Cieslarová explained.
While the data showed the operator after the release of roaming fees of high intermediate growth, the number of phone calls is much lower.
The number of minutes spent in roaming has increased from last year to two years.
With a huge leap ahead of other countries, Germany dominates here.
"Roaming is more used by corporate customers on business routes," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in the home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
The former Ronan Rafferty golf unit will be held in the atmosphere of the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area East Lothian, which hosts 25-year-old Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year on the nearby Archerfield Links golf course along the way to the finals under Paul Eales. This year he will perform the role of the ambassador of the tournament in representing the founder of the club and CEO of Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club grow slowly in front of my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
"The players will be able to love the first-class quality of the game.
Jerry did a great job.
He's a proud supporter of this game and he's proud of his success.
This tournament is in the right hand."
English Eales will first defend the master's title, despite the fact that he won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," said the Southport golfer.
"I had no chance to defend my victory at the Extremedura Open, because the tournament was canceled year after my victory.
Returning to this part of the country is magic.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when for me and my wife Sharon meant a real victory.
It was a beautiful time I didn't forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour, returns to his home country after 50 years of celebrating this year.
This event will be his first participation from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like playing on the home floor," Orr said about Helensburg.
“You want to do it and then feel a lot of pressure.
I'm really glad I played again, and I think I'm doing it.
I'm happy with the result today."
The three players will also be joined by former winner Masters Ian Woosnam and senior tournaments Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players in the game; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Free access to the tournament. Parking is 5 £ per car with one passenger and 10 £ per car with two and more passengers.
Any profit will be devoted to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian country of gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he's only rarely using a doll.
In its wooden chattel, located in the main city of Pania Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply wears the sweet potatoes - in the words of local "note" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, let's take out a potato and enjoy it with your bare hands.
Bardina is sitting on a muddy land - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, such as washing laundry in a watertight nearby.
The hair in the room without the roof adds to the toilet.
As the youngest of four wives of her husband, she was not assigned any fields for processing.
We compare them here.
Work in late night hours is a danger: most men from the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, soldiers sit in the village.
"In the afternoon, after five o'clock, no one will allow to fly around the village," said Bardina.
It is a rare view of daily life at the height of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were brought to vote in the form of a public raise before the occupying army.
The current protest movement against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakart government, which ruled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil law watchers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - the independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is so remote and deserted a city where you will arrive after ninety minutes from the capital of Jayapura to Nabira, and then a five-hour stomach that carries the ride.
The joint transport in this place doesn't work.
The town of 19,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo slabs, roofs of woolen spots in the shade and cutting colors.
There were only very few Indonesians in this place, but journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, the local people worshiped the God of Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing these dresses," says Bardina, showing her colorful, hand-blown turbane, dark shirt, and teary dress.
"We used to wear only sheets."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and the infant mortality and obesity is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, it's an Indonesian land of gold.
The largest and most generous gold piece in the Grasberg world, which owns Freeport McMoran from the American Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Panai - a rocked province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
Just in 2015, Freeport spent gold and copper at $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports the worth of wood worth $78 billion.
However, for the Pope, this wealth is a source of suffering and a guarantee of withdrawal from the powerful Indonesian army.
From the investigation carried out in 2005 by the New York Times, Freeport has paid local military agents and units approximately $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
The popes who call for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely oppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 popes have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, imprisoned, and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass killings in the Papui tribal area during the 70th century amounted to genocide, as the Asian Human Rights Commission stated.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
In Will Lose Everything, the report of the brisbanese archdiocese of 2016, describes the cruelty that occurred last year, such as extrajudicial corrections, torture - according to other reports is particularly popular rape and correction of the electric current - and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims, because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harrison, an Indonesian research worker from the Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation has made it difficult for the papal sources to attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% report Christianity, but demography changes with the flow of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Jávy, Bornea, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan canteens sell roasted chicken and gado-gad or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants began selling chicken and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than local Papua," explains 40-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Pania and moved to the capital of Jayapura.
"The original inhabitants of Papuy - mother-mom (women) - lost their jobs."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo, who is renamed Jokovi, promised to solve injustice and abuse of rights in 2014.
The former treasurer has secured his way to the Presidential Palace in January 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Panai.
But in Papua, it has changed very little and local people feel hurt.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwio with the hope that he will hear our call for justice," you said.
In fact, only two months after the October opening of James, Panai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang the Christmas song in camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbike came out at night.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers with this tower and the one with which she was expelled touched and later returned with four other soldiers, introduced the local Pharaoh Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in a subjugated state followed a group of children and seized them with their weapons, brought in victims and witnesses.
One of the soldiers then set fire to a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was stabbed so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the construction of the electoral commission nearby and the next day things were still coming up.
About 1,000 young men and women gathered at the football club in front of the local police station and the military command and demanded justice.
They came with ritual hunting ports and performed the dance of Waita - where it runs in the circle and resembles the singing of birds - the Papuan village of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants started throwing stones at the building.
With increasing tension, the soldiers were ordered by radio: "If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot," reported the Times weekly in an official document, whose content has never been published in local media.
Jeremias Kayame (56), head of the district of Enarotali Kego Koto, recognized the danger and urged the inhabitants to disperse into their homes.
But no one had anything to say to him.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left armpit," said the TIME weekly at the veranda of my painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to his word, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, was killed three times, according to his cousin, who was a witness to the shooting.
"I ran to the body to convince myself that it is really him," said the Timesman with a dull voice John, who uses only one name as a lot of Indonesians.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
The Papuanian police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only "provided" the station under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," said Pudio Sultisio, a press spokesman for the Papuaan Police in 2015.
"It's a question of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five protestors were killed and many were expelled from the scene.
The murder report was filed by the Jakart media the following day.
About three weeks later, Jokovi presented a passionate speech in Jayapura and expressed his understanding of the victims' families and promised to deal with the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never repeat itself," he said.
The Minister of National Security in October 2016 announced that he will introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve the violent acts that occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, they began calling excuses.
“Most acts of violence have been committed a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 90th century and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we're deciding to punish these violent acts, but it won't be a simple task," he said.
In a discussion of June 5th for the TIME week that took place in Jakarta, Viranto claimed that he did not plan to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, it says that “all cases will be brought before the court.”
Viranto, accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” on the basis of more than one thousand dead during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, has stated that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the incident in Pania, have been brought to an end.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Panai welcomed his claim with disbelief.
“In the last three years, I have been questioned four times, but I have not yet expected anything,” John said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," as they claim.
"I'm afraid an army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Pania residents who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to him, he was captured by the army after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After the body was buried, I started looking for an army," he said.
And shooting doesn't stop yet.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in the neighboring Deiyai.
In the event that one person died and another 17 were injured, there was a dispute between the village manager and the construction company, which refused to provide assistance in the transport of a man unconsciously to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned in fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the building company.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at them and responded to them were a firearm.
Locals, however, claim that the mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the dome and killed one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of the payout," said the 29-year-old Domingg Badii, who lived near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded.
"I haven't left home in two days."
The Deiyai Parliament demanded the punishment of the police involved and the landing of the mobile brigade from the area.
The ladies were always staring in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the native peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in central highlands.
Many of them joined the Pope’s Liberation Movement (OPM) - the army of rebels who protect the rights of the Pope by attacking and destroying Indonesian policemen.
Some of the leaders of the OPM come from Pania. They belong between not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judes Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has been arrested in recent years and has freely detained thousands of Paniai residents, all under the pretext of "protection of national sovereignty".
Some of them don't belong anymore.
The Panai are known among the inhabitants of Papua as "a tragic and forgotten place".
Oil in fire brings poverty.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
And bread is equally inconvenient.
The people here are growing their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leaf vegetables.
Women work on the fields; each of them covers four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the tiles are intended for family needs, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes are only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened several air routes and started to flow to the country, there has been a rise in economic inequality between the Papuans and immigrants.
Even so few jobs usually contain more educated and richer immigrants.
The popes rarely have the necessary capital and education to let them go to business.
"Young people move from villages due to the lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, President of the Pania Family Council.
Thanks to the isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
They also contribute to strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from the pope for "a lack of cooperation with the authorities", despite the fact that they were given so rare permission to film.
Phelim China, the representative of the Asia branch of the Human Rights Watch, Jokovi, in his election campaign, promised to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development. However, this has never happened.
"For foreign journalists working in the most challenging eastern regions of Papua and West Papua, there is a great risk: the ignorance of visas and the inclusion in the blacklist," the statement stated.
Lack of news from foreign journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesia in the Papui case is to a considerable extent limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - were ordered by the Human Rights Council of the United Nations regarding the investigation of "diversity and extended violence" in Papua, including shooting in Pania.
These countries in the past also supported the OPM.
The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir filed an accusation when he told reporters in Jakarta: "In Indonesia a democratic system and the media are still free, it is therefore difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations."
Local people are calling after foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, in front of the human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people were doing according to the source that also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, the word "we want freedom".
For 2019, other elections are scheduled in Indonesia, but the popes say they won't vote for Jokovi.
"Joko is a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people connected with shooting in Pania," said Gobau, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Panai - except that they live in constant fear of the plundering army - are struggling in poverty, poor education and health systems.
Gobai claims that the Panai people, as well as the other Popes, regard their voice as "debt", which Jokovi must pay.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite threats and threats to the family of the victims of the Panais shootings, they continue in the last symbolic act of strike: burying the bodies of the victims on the ground instead of the police and military stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least it will not allow responsible persons to forget their crimes.
"He killed a member of our family," said Yacobus with a closed head.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy caught a huge supply of cocaine in Australia.
The French Navy kept a 1,46 tonnes of cocaine in the Pacific yacht worth about $256 million.
The consignee was heading to Australia.
The four-year crew of the ship was arrested, which was apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
Jachta, named after Afalina, sailed from South America and the police took her to the port of Noumea, the metropolis of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific.
The Australian intelligence department has indicated that in cooperation with its international partners, it will strive to determine exactly where and where the drugs were directed, and to identify the "Lithuania syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large number of drugs targeting Australia," her executive director Col Blanch said.
Drugs were destroyed this week in Noumé.
Australia is an attractive destination for its passengers because of high street prices.
The country also faces the problem of increasing numbers of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current contract is not the first time.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting a large amount of drugs from the United States to Australia, who tried to cross the Pacific in a small plane.
The seniors don't feel thirsty, drink is necessary to remind them.
The problem may be in the homes of seniors, according to the Geriatric clinic doctor, the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavly Mádlovs could be infusion of the physiological solution that is sucking with that needle under the skin.
But they are still only applied in medical devices.
The older the person, the lower the amount of water in his body.
"In addition, it loses the feeling of thirst, so the seniors generally take less fluid and they dehydrate very quickly," Mādlová said.
Two liters should drink for sure.
"But getting to the old man so much fluid is a big problem," she added.
In the homes of seniors, it's often said that no doctor is watching.
In patients, dehydration is usually resolved by infusion.
"I think that there should also be a gradual introduction so that they can get subcutaneous infusion," she said.
According to it, old people can add up to two semilitres of physiological solution.
A lack of fluid may lead to malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration appears to be a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day that old man will say he can't get up from bed, he's talking confused," she added.
In the event of neglect, it may occur to the brain.
Blood will clot, and it's stuck in the brain, and it's also threatening kidney failure.
The lying patients should not be covered with a pen, which is the maximum of cotton.
The problem can also be one-time plunging.
"It's more expensive, but it would be ideal for the patient to occasionally discover and let the skin grow," the doctor said.
The Torch has already burned a second nightmare in Dubai
In Dubai on Friday, one of the world's largest residential nightmares was set in flames. The Hasicians had to evacuate all inhabitants 337 meters high and 79 floors.
In the last two years, there has already been a second fire in this high building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch (Genesis).
All the inhabitants of the building were evacuated and there was no injury. The cause of the fire is unknown.
"We slept and woke up the alarm. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes before we ran down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Geroge, one of the residents of the darkhouse.
The Dubai Civil Defence stated that fires were managed by fire under control around the fourth hour of the morning (0:00 GMT), which continued in the cooling of the building.
Government officials have added that they provide replacement accommodation for the affected population.
The incident could call again for discussions on the safety of materials used to cover high buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation, which led to the conduct of the Torch cloud after the fire in 2015, showed that the most damage to the coating and the external panels used for decoration or insulation was caused.
The British police stated that the system of isolation and siege of the London Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid spread of fire at the red fire, with almost 80 people killed.
The results of the survey showed that more than one of the five U.S. passengers found prohibited items on board the aircraft
A survey among passengers showed that more than 20 percent of them were deliberately or unconsciously banned via the U.S. Government Agency Transportation Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers were on board the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim that they were late to find that they were traveling with guns, ammunition, or explosives.
From the results of the survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc., which responded to more than 1,000 questionnaires, it appeared that in younger passengers there is a higher likelihood of violations of the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to travel with the object prohibited by TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand hours of flying compared to less than 15 percent of the members of Generation X.
The most common items that have escaped TSA's attention include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents were aware of the acute issue, while 2.2 percent of the women questioned and 3.7 percent of the men questioned also admitted that they deliberately carried the prohibited drugs on board the aircraft.
The company stated that it was carrying out research between passengers around the world to find out how many of them had accidentally found unauthorized items through air traffic control and how much they had done so successfully.
It is not surprising that most people who have carried unauthorized items - whether they are conscious or ignorant - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA Directive is somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what fluids and how much they can carry to the plane.
It is not surprising, then, that TSA has played in the largest amount of just prohibited fluids.
For a certain time, people thought that TSA would deliver books in the same way as the goods used.
The transfer of fluids is allowed within foreign flights, not international.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on deferring planned guidelines for reducing Obama's emissions
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by 15 States, her former head, Scott Pruitt, withdrew its decision to postpone the implementation of the plan by the former Obama administration to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes within his plan. He reacts so much more gently than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge raised against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This applies to the last deadline set on 1 October when Member States should comply with the 2015 Regulation to reduce the amount of groundwater.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement in one year and arrange for a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "aggravating local decisions or threatening economic growth".
Pruitt, who, prior to reaching the role of President Donald Trump, held the position of Attorney-General of Oklahoma, served for a long time as a reliable supporter of stricter environmental regulations.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or removed the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The urgent media is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA operator exceeded its authority in order to delay the inclusion of the Obama administrative plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce the losses of methane.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of the ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperation with the States through complex processes and the implementation of new standards within the time frame.
"The previous administration of the EPA often did not meet the deadlines and waited for it to be complained about by the activist groups and others, agreeing with the alignment and other arrangements of the plans," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen complaints in his previous position to the EPA.
"We do not believe in regulation through judicial disputes and we take the deadline seriously.
We never consider our statute and authority that comes out of it."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may, at a certain point, use "the possibility of extending and all other legally available authorities", to ensure that the regulations "will be based on sound policies and the most accessible information".
The Republicans at the Congress press for a broader rewriting of ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
The measures have not yet been passed by the Senate.
New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was in charge of the coalition of states who complained this week of the EPA, stated that the group would not allow legal pressure.
"To address the EPA's views - following our judicial review - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million non-U.S. and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
The ground ozone occurs when the common harmful substances released by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and every year and thousands of premature deaths.
Public health and environmentalists suddenly welcome Pruitt's change.
"It is worrying what pressure it takes to develop to change the thinking of responsible people and to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological harassment of Trump's administration, which is trying to help polluters and special interests."
He's had men with acid, but he's not in danger according to the court.
You never know what can happen to you.
In one moment you're at home with your family and you laugh, in the other you'll suddenly change your whole life from base.
And the worst part is that you can't do anything about it.
Similarly, Andreas Christopheros of the United Kingdom met with an unknown attacker who had finally been released from prison.
The information was introduced by the Web Reuters.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at Christopheros.
Andreas woke up to go open.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver the Christmas gift for the family that day.
Instead, there was a terrible surprise waiting for him.
The man who never saw him in life, immediately after he had been opened without warning, was soaked with the words, "This is for you, my friend."
That pain was unsubstantiated.
The clothes fell on me like nothing, and I just felt a pain on my skin that wasn't real," Andreas said.
His family quickly took him to the hospital, but his neighbors heard a terrible message - according to doctors, he had no chance to survive.
Several weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would suffer an infection that threatened to penetrate his wound.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent were infected with a face that doctors tried to bring together skin from other parts of the body.
A great complication for Christopheros has become the loss of eyelids.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today Christopheros has twelve operations behind him, which are far from the last.
The injuries suffered by the victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical advances and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, the victims have tissue discovered for the rest of their life.
"Sometimes people don't turn around and fight for deformation and reincarnation all their life," said Professor Peter Djewulski, a British association of plastic and aesthetic surgeons.
The attacker is confused.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure that an unknown man had to deal with someone.
Pachatel believed that he was the town of a man who sexually abused his close friend.
The police searched the whole case properly and the attacker went after.
The man was initially sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict to the glory of Christopher’s family changed substantially.
"Three judges finally came to the conclusion that punishment should be abolished, because a man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the last few years, the number of attacks with fatty substances has grown significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior expressed its concern that it was planning to lay down new guidelines for state representatives regarding the classification of giraffes.
You should be listed among the dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks do not intend to give up.
They demand that the government of the United Kingdom impose more severe and longer penalties on people who attack their environment with acid or other fatty substances.
They also require enhanced control of the sale of dangerous substances, which are often used to be delivered in different stores, as it is a variety of cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned a famous nightmare in the night, The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence, the inhabitants of the 80-foot building managed to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to the Cuban police, he fired a fire on the ninth floor and spread himself up.
According to some, though, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, so they told us," said one of the tenants.
According to another tenant quoted by the Reuters agency, fire broke out in the highest floors and spread down with falling heat.
We slept.
He woke us up with an alarm, people screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," said tenant George.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the flames had taken up about 40 apartments.
On the ground fire destroyed at least two cars when the burning parts of the building fell on them.
About two hours later, according to the Civil Defence Notice, a fire was fired under control.
The reason for his creation is not yet known.
According to the witnesses in the surrounding buildings, there was a leak.
The vast fire damaged the Dubai nightmare The Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over a hundred flats.
There are about 680 apartments in the whole building.
Nothing happened then, because the residents managed to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became the tallest residential building world with its 352 meters.
The record was prepared immediately next year by another dubian nightmare.
The culturalist had 14 incredible doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, in a sample of 30-year-old Ippolita, there was a large collection of illicit drugs - from steroids through diuretics on Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, this wild mix didn't help him with his title, finished his fourth.
Now the culturalist is threatened by a four-year distance and a criminal strike.
Record was 11.
Last year, Italian ragbiist Davide Vasta was tested positively for 11 doping substances, which was a record number among the athletes who had arrived.
According to his words, the third player began to take steroids a year before he lost his culture.
Lucka Vondraczová, Czech Republic.
She had a real hug with an ex-boyfriend!
Sotva Lucka Vondračka has stepped into the territory of the Czech Republic, is in one circle.
And he's also paying attention wherever he comes.
Last time she got into her former lover Michal Longhý, with whom she had been living for three years.
Herec was 12 years old at the time and already wanted his family.
Lucii was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly did not want to spend her career in the cemetery.
So they left, but the friends stayed until today.
What they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met for a long time.
Sodo's random, both of them were in the blue color.
At first, they didn't notice themselves, but then they got closer and Lucie laughed at Michael's victims when she fell in the back of her stomach.
Then they hugged the photographers and gladly invited the photographers.
However, their meetings were not an accident, so they are playing together a few millennia in the new Primy Captain Exner series.
In Britain, the Islamists were given life in preparation for the assassination.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of an Islamic cell to live on the net, who said Three Musketeers and the prosecutors said they were planning a terrorist attack on the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom attended the training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted of similar consequences, were arrested in August.
The authorities then thought he was going to attack immediately.
In one of the men's cars, security agents found a partially finished tube bomb, knives with inscriptions that in Arabic mean "unbelievable", and a machine gun.
It happened at a time when the MI5 secret service agent put the hearing equipment in the car.
"The recent assassinations showed what fear the accused might have caused, if they were not stopped," the prosecutor of Sue Hemming said.
Three sentences at the age of 28, 25 and 33 may apply for exemption after 20 years.
The fourth convicted person, 38 years of age, can do so after 15 years behind the grid.
Men in London declared that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car put agent MI5 in there.
The court also heard her, but then the defendants refused.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 °C in Hodoninsky.
The internal temperature record of 37,3 degrees Celsius remained on the corner for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, which was recorded in the Watch Tower in Hodoninsk, it was overcome by a Thursday, which has become the warmest day of this year.
This was confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On the other hand, on Thursday, there were not many thermal records.
On Tuesday, records were exceeded or compared to 35 of 145 meteorological stations measuring more than 30 years.
On Thursday, record temperatures were recorded for only nine long measuring stations.
The fourth temperature was probably the same as the previous 2013 record.
In the Lednica in Břeclavsk, the initial maximum of four tenths in degrees was 37.4 degrees above the record of three tenths in the current 37.1 degrees in the Břeclavsk.
Both records as well as the Watchtower came from 2013.
West was ten degrees less.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Watchtower, there was the largest lead in the Dyjakovii in Znojemska and Brodá nad Dij nad Břeclavska, where the mercury was duly extracted to 37,8 degrees, but the record did not surpass.
On the other hand, for example, in Western and North-West Czechs, the ČHMU website has so far been the fourth highest temperature only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there began to grow until now afternoon," said meteorologists.
The current weather in the Czech Republic will gradually decline according to the ČHMU, and on Sunday they could also come with more significant rain.
Most Moravia places, however, will remain high temperatures on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia and on Saturday.
China misses tourists.
Beijing's visa policy is worth billions.
China has been trying to apply its influence for decades without the use of force.
Each year, she spends ten billion dollars on supporting language schools and building universities abroad, pushing her entertainment industry on foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
But that's not happening to Beijing.
The dark state media is talking about the plan to make tourism a driving force for economic change and modernisation.
However, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 per cent last year, and about 80 per cent of tourists came from Hong Kong, Macaa and Taiwan.
It is appropriate, inter alia, that despite all of its global aspirations, China is not familiar with foreigners just with the open arms, assessing the situation in the world's most familiar country of the world's economy professor from the Beijing University of Christopher Balding in an article for the Bloomberg Agency.
An example that speaks for everything is a Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have a wireless contact with China, citizens of those other countries have to arrange a visa with the front.
The Chinese authorities in the United States are therefore comparable to the Chinese New Year's celebrations.
The visa is $140, but if a person does not want to wait for long hours in the front, he has to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions constitute significant economic obstacles.
Study Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors in the country by 70 per cent.
In 2015, China visited only two million Americans, while Hong Kong, which shares less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and lives there less than one percent of all Americans, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often exacerbates this problem by using tourism to achieve its political objectives, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China in the spring restricted transport to South Korea under the crack around the South Korean missile system, the South Koreans paid it and China avoided it.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 per cent, while Japan had an 85 per cent increase.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report published by the US Central Bank, Fed was able to leave China as a result of Chinese foreign travels up to $ 190 billion, while China will earn about $35 billion annually in the course of the sale of the currency to future tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion last year in tourism, which is equal to 44% of the total Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
A small number of tourists, then, in a country that is anxious to protect the flow of capital, are suffering a very painful wound.
However, the above factors are only one indication of the general sustainability of foreigners.
In many places China has not heard about immigrants in any way.
More than a million foreigners lived throughout China in 2013.
There are more of them in the United States and some individual cities.
And Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has a double.
A number of scientific works, however, show that immigrants usually revive economic growth, business and innovation.
However, you will not find them in China.
To solve these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is being taken is to simplify the visual device.
Other Asian states, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently made a great effort to simplify and improve visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the zoo, there were mortally poisoned beaches.
The Plzeň Kingdom can be enjoyed by young people in just three rare, deadly beaches.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only nine freshly born Turkish snakes.
This species lives in North Anatolia, and it is at an altitude of 2,000 metres.
"It's too long for the subway," said the speaker zoo Martin Vobruba.
The young of the other two species, the mortals and the cobras red, will so far take power in the garden's backyard.
We still can't tell when people will see them.
"We would hate to talk about them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying that it could take a year or two.
Australia's snake killers came into the world eight, they're the descendants of a breeding couple from the population around Sydney.
"The only visitors who can see at the exhibition are dead people from around Perth," said Vobruba, saying that in human care, 6-8 weeks of wintering is necessary at the temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
The percentage of success has been achieved by African swimming cobras red.
A couple in the pulsary zoo had been washed out of four eggs of a total of four young people.
"Incubation lasted 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species in the wild emits poison on its victim, up to four meters away.
He's focused on his eyes, he can make up for the long-lasting blindness.
Young people of all three species live in a zoo with mice.
Up to 40 days in the garden are still expected to be breast-feeding from the mother's kidney black, eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unconfirmed phone call review, Trump creates pressure on Mexico due to the payment of a border wall
The American Journal of Washington Post has published a summary of President Trump's phone calls with leading representatives of Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone conversation on 27 January with Mexican President Enrique Peño, Trump ordered her to stop public reporting that she would not pay for the building of the proposed wall.
The U.S. President calculated that he was publicly condemning the building of the wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like this in the press."
Trump in his campaign promised to build a wall along the southern border and reported that Mexico would pay for it.
He also lost his first call to the public with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a rapid exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the United States supervisory agreement on refugees heading to Australia was "smooth" and "smooth" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came after President Obama's governments - he would look like "druged" after he proposed a ban on the entry of refugees into the United States.
The trumpet call ended after Turnbull explained that "this is my most unpleasant call of the day".
The press again spoke to the prosecutor for Smolensk.
"There is nothing to worry about," Tusko said at the address of the dead president, President of the Government of the Law and Justice of PiS Jaroslaw Kaczynski.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski does not scare me," Tusk told the country's current leadership that he is trying to abuse justice against political opponents.
On his way out of the prosecutor's office, he waited on Tuska on TV 24 dat, who was blackmailing Donald Tusk! and wanted politics for a hundred years!
Tusk thanked me for his support and assured me that he had a clean conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczynski won't scare me."
It doesn't count anything to the prosecutors, according to their words, but it doesn't doubt that justice now has the Polish rulers to serve as a tool against opponents, opposition or people who don't like, and I'm afraid I belong to this group.
It's been a long time since the interview.
The Expremier has been questioned at the prosecutor's office for a second time, this time the request was to raise doubts about the drinking of the victims of the smoldering disaster.
In addition, there was a replacement for the body in the skull.
The families were forbidden to open their shells, and there must have been some reason for this.
And the reason was that they were afraid of scandal because he would make Polish-Russian relations difficult.
"Keeping good relations at any price, despite such horrific events, should have served to make Donald Tusk a very important person in the EU," Kaczynski said on the Catholic TV Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would stifle Tusko's chances of obtaining the most important seat in the Union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczynski declared that he had warned German officeman Angel Merkel that Donald Tuske could do it differently, but she didn't take it for granted.
Tusk has filed an eight-hour inquiry into the prosecutor's office on April 19th.
He didn't even speak as a suspect, just as a witness.
However, many of his calls to the hearing were considered part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the leader of PiS Kaczynski to discredit Tuska as a political rival in connection with various scandals.
The prosecutor is a minister of justice who plays the role of the Attorney-General in Poland.
The hearing was held after the election of Tuska, the head of the European Council, to which Kaczynski tried hard but tried hard to prevent, among other things, the visit of Merkelov in Warsaw.
Finally, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlova protested at the EU summit against the extension of the Tusko mandate.
In this case, he left Warsaw on the stakes and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs choose everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, the registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the monument from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
It comes from a statement that regulates the delivery of voting papers to the stranger.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update and is currently in the process of commenting.
Four years ago, a number of Members were elected to the 10 000 Czech citizens abroad.
"Since the latest renewal of the 2013 release, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry explains its procedure.
"In some countries, new representative offices have emerged, some offices have been closed, there may have been a change in the level of representation," it says in the material.
The statement shall contain two annexes, the first of which shall be listed by the representative authorities to which the ballot papers are delivered.
This group of offices is represented by the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive the ballot card in the printing version.
It's their list that's changing.
Four years ago, for example, Czechs were able to choose from the Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Both embassies are closed today.
The Czech Republic also abolished its representation in the Malagasy Bamako and the Japanese Kjota.
He won't even be elected to the Consulate General in Doneck.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in the east of Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassys in Kenyan Nairobi, the main city of Dakar, and Zambian Lusace.
In the Czech Republic, since the last parliamentary elections, it has extended its representation on the General Consulate in Irbil and Čcheng-tu, the capital of the Chinese province of S'Čchuan.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters in Czech embassys in Barmá and Cambodia.
The Czechs have had the opportunity to elect MPs in the polling stations at representative offices or consulates for four times.
Before any election, the national electoral commission shall determine by lot the country for which the candidates are voted abroad.
The first was in 2002, when it was decided between the Yugoslav candidates.
In the following two elections, Czechs were elected abroad among the Yugoslav candidates.
As in 2013, the Central Region was selected as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is rising steadily.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3800 people came to vote, in 2006 they were about 6700, four years later 8222.
The previous snow elections four years ago were delivered to the 10.571 voters' embassy.
Masakr on Moore's Ford Bridge: Activists remembered racist lynching
Ford Mercury from 1948 passed around the nearby inhabitants of Monroe, Georgia, and crashed towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before the car with four passengers of black skin and a white driver had enough to reach the bridge, a group of white men with weapons were restored to him.
The leader of the group - the man of the middle age in the tangled suit - took a lot of cigarettes and stared at the front glass of the car.
The passengers were terrified inside.
"We want that--a Roger!" cried the man.
"Bring him to me!"
Quietly break the young black man's neck, which is pulled out of the seat of the companion.
This scene is fortunately just a reconstruction event that took place on July 22nd.
But if one of the men passes through Roger's neck of the process, the obscenity is excited by excitement.
Since 2005, the Moore's Ford has been returning to the bridge regularly by a group of activists who reconstructed it on the fate night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - killed members of Kukluxklan.
No one has been tried for murder so far.
"It is a wonder that in all those years there has not been a single person arrested - although we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," Tyrone Brooks, who helps to reorganise the event.
"It is a virtue to our history and burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the state of Georgia and a life-saving warrior for civil law.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to the event. Every year, the community of Monroe recalls that justice was not done enough.
"We demand judicial appeal and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," Brooks said.
"The healing and reconciliation process cannot be initiated by then."
The doctor covers one of the victims of the lynching at Moore's Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI records received by NBC News, the lynching was to involve up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding periods.
But no one has been tried so far.
Although the suspects remain for decades at liberty, citizens' rights advocates claim that both reasons of lust - politics and sex - were known to all citizens of the city.
In April 1946, on the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court, the citizens of the state of Georgia were granted the first right to participate in the elections planned for the summer.
And just during the summer elections, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom had to push the landowner of the white plait Barnett Hester - allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, Hester was betrayed to take care of Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and brought her to another state.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946, the then significant landowner of the white plait of Loy Harrison for Malcolm's bail amounted to $600.
He was escorted to the prison by Dorothy and Mae Murray and George Dorsey's cousins.
When they returned from prison just before they arrived at Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects were in their way.
"As it turned out, the murder was planned and organized by Harrison," the FBI explained.
"It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between state and local law defenders who not only took part in lynching, but also left the evidence and kept the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks expressed himself more cautiously on the whole issue.
"It was a massacre for election rights," he said.
"Killers have had a clear subtext for all local black people: "this is how you will be affected if you register and go to vote."
Each year's reconstruction of the event at Moore's Ford bridge is organised by Cassandra Greene for almost ten years.
Its presentation is vivid, entertaining and vivid. It shows deep-rooted racism, which many would like to see in modern America as extinct.
Looking at this reconstruction is not easy and it's even harder to reverse the sight, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching, because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hiding in each of us," Greene said.
"But we can't have a relationship unless you're listening to what I had to go through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June and immediately on the first day about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of blacks - entered the room where Greene had met with a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is running the position of the assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of Kukluxklan, but according to his words, the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about it because it resists who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it is very important to remind ourselves regularly of this part of history, because we never want to go back to that time."
Hercs Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcom's role at Barnett Hester, are practicing their roles.
The show starts with a tap - Malcom deals with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get out of my land n--e!"
Rascona can't be found.
He's coming for a ride.
At that moment, all (at least every black actor) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs at everything.
"What happened?" asked Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," is Greene's joy.
"I just don't think the whites said "n-r" like that."
"Precisely," one of the players runs a black coat.
"You have to focus more on R."
The energy in the room is all of a sudden better; the enemy rewards the feeling of approaching.
All they want is to have an authentic performance, just to be done for four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time, Rascona focuses on the correct wording of the word to N.
Nobody's laughing anymore.
The performance ends violently and quickly.
Reev, the shots... and they'll be quiet.
The woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings a sad song by Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit".
Every word is in the room feeling sad.
On the back of that, about a dozen eye-seeing eyes clear the path and tears.
In obstetrics there is practically the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple came from New York, Ithaca, a lot of people looking around them.
Each of them has a local wet climate of almost eight hours and Brooks is in representation leading to the tombs of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, the murder could have been looked at with a retreat, but now, standing in the same place where there was lightning, the atmosphere is terrifying.
In the final words of the song, the Green crowd will call for the inspection of the bodies.
The children cry to the victim's head, they watch false blood, and they're insinuating something in their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy's sure.
He'll run for a few minutes and Greene's thanks for the obsessive.
The heroes clean up the wool and raise their voices.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, a man in a suit who played the head of Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascon will embrace his two herring friends and cry in their arms; at last his emotions are on him.
"It's okay," one of the sixth women said.
"We know that you have a role to play.
But you had a reason for that."
Later that same day, he's sitting in the lobby with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are busy talking about the presentation with the black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski's barely found words that would express her feelings from today's performance.
“It’s hard to listen to those harsh words and look at the terrible consequences... that people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said to the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still the current theme," she added, "only called police moves".
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he was already planning a performance for another year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment of thought," he said.
"If we don't learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know or study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it."
I love instructions for use.
One of my friends says that the instructions to use are read only to the srab.
I don't agree, on the contrary.
It's one of the modern forms of art, it's often the root of surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember a long time ago, where the instructions for the use of anything was rather a rare order.
So my first gramophone contained only one paper on which were the hieroglyphics showing the involvement of some parts, and there were some secret marks on all of them.
After years of showing up inside, I offered that letter to a shaman who wasn't afraid to scratch the back of the board.
He gave me a tip of what the paper with the labyrinth is suitable for.
Yes, it was the usual help for the chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He quickly found a loose wire and made it possible for me to listen to expensive vinyl cookies again.
The new era has brought new directions.
And a relatively simple fruit-enhancer, where he simply held the overcrowd, demanded about ten pictures.
Especially mentioned was a short description of how to insert one part into another.
The composition was ambiguous and the other procedure just wasn't possible.
On the contrary, giving it required considerable effort with the necessity of breaking certain plastic components.
My misbehaving instructions ended at my Seat Leon self-defense.
The 2003 production year still had such a book with a reference to small repairs, which included, among other things, the exchange of flashlights.
It was simple.
A total of three steps and work should be done.
Unfortunately, the author reminded us that while the lamp went to the right, it was only in three steps.
1. split the cover.
2. Cut out the glass lamp and fold a new one.
3rd floor cover.
The lamp on the left had a problem in the way of placing the battery cover.
At first, I thought I'd put the right upper ends into the vehicle's frame of some kind of handcuff, a screw that she's covering easily and then I'm going to drive points 1-3 of the resistant author of the service book.
I think it's a pencil.
The cover had no place, no space, no room for the slipper's hand, but the binding Slezan.
I've lost half an hour of my life, and it's all without any success.
The condition was still strengthened by my wife's entrance to the garage, which he called for the rice and the words that from my mouth heard quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I miss the vulgar terms, there were only two publications left.
I'm changing the lamp.
"And why does it take you so long?" she threatened with a word that in a long-lasting relationship could be her last.
I slowly explained the problem to her, focusing on the torture process of the author's instruction, where the blessing of the iron burning on her hand, which she wrote, followed her grasp so that she could never write anything again, was only an introduction to the wide range of Kladiva's instructions to the witch, including his commissional fire on the top of the Losin Castle.
"What's it like to unload that box?" said the woman to the battery.
There was a real hope for this and then a step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's until the day my colleague called, who just got off the college post after the check-in of the two state drug control offices.
I know her as a well-balanced colleague who has experienced the possible and impossible in the field and who can also interpret wild stories by unresolved voice.
"Present that I have received a fine for not having an elevated hand-washing instruction," he told me with a weak voice.
Gradually, I solved the whole problem of having no visual instructions to wash your hands over the toilet of patients.
His argument to the Commission's office that the adult has the right to exercise his hands and that the need for icons to control the normal activity of the decent people has no beneficial effect and has become a little money to him.
"She's not just like that," she told him.
He understood that the simple dissipation of frozen hand-flowing water is a primitive effect at the level of the chromañol, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, carries out this ceremony in ten steps.
So we need to tell you that we need to get out of the water pit.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it's a joy to find that a man has his hands in exactly the way he's ordered by the SüKL hosudar.
Finally, I have to assume that I've let myself be inspired and I'm preparing a detailed plan of action on the toilet.
In the case of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, in exercise, given the difference between the two sexes, it will be necessary to draw out two instructions.
The problem remains those pictograms, because to create a perfect procedure means also the exact description of all anatomical details, which could trigger a certain refurbishment in the spring visitor's toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn that he has made the right opening in his entire life.
Pearson leaves 3,000 other employees and reduces dividends in an attempt to revive the trade
On Friday, the British education group Pearson stated that it would release another 3,000 employees and reduce the temporary dividend by 72 per cent in response to another restructuring programme to change the business model.
The next voluntary release, which the Executive Director, John Fallon said will come at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, follows the previous decision of the company to miss 4000 employees in the framework of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce the cost of another 300 million pounds (394 million dollars) in May under the third programme to reduce costs in an effort to create a decline in trade due to the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share in Penguin Random House of Bertelsmann, stated that this year's outlook remained unchanged after it announced a one-percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed at a suicide explosion
A suicide assassin attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul. During the attack one NATO soldier died and several others were injured, official representatives were appointed.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, as NATO said.
According to informal reports, three civilians died during the attack in the city of Qarabagh.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday when the war broke out.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In his statement, NATO stated that the Tuesday explosion had occurred after monitoring the Afghan army's members were attacked by a "local person with a home-made explosive device".
The statement further states that all injuries of soldiers are beyond the risk of life and are located in the US military hospital on the airport base of Bagram.
According to the rapporteurs, the increasing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the area of Qarabagh is a significant source of concerns for NATO's liaison forces in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people died in a car in the Shia cabin.
The Taliban has joined the attack.
On 31 May, a large explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people. This is the most deadly militant attack in the country since the US units launched the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence is already undermining the situation in Afghanistan, and the President of the United States Donald Trump considers an increase in the number of American soldiers who should help military units and police in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide attacks he has experienced in recent weeks by public confidence in the government, its regulation, and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanín.
In response to the complaint, the EPA has reassessed its decision to remove the smoking rules
The U.S. Agency for the Protection of the Environment has withdrawn its decision to postpone the Obama law, which has ordered states to reduce emissions, only the day after 15 States have been injured by the Agency.
In the middle of the night hours, EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the 2015 Ozone Standards, saying it presented the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will listen to their opinions," said EPA Director Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's efforts to distance the ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and on the basis of the measures, define the limits that must be met by October 2018.
The group of fifteen of the majority of democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., filed a complaint on Tuesday, arguing that the EPA is illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to prevent many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words, in an effort to boost economic growth.
However, the efforts of the new government have been counter-measured by the Democrats and Conservative groups who are concerned about the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA on its website states that breathing air with ozone content “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnár got the wound and blood!
Tohoto, with us a relatively new singer, you may already have registered in June this year, when this almost unknown singer with us has arranged for the Czech conditions of a monster action, on which he has hosted such leading personalities as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krain, and a number of others, and the action has no one else than Leos Mares.
The purpose was simple, to show the public and to present their music video to the song of Sara, whose baptism was slandered by the very named personalities.
However, few people know that the video clip itself, which took place in Russia, did not go away without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big film with the stars of the Russian national ballet and it didn't go away without a proper trap.
The song of Sara is very emotional and is based on unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramaticity of the scene, in the video clip of the singers, the juice had to mark the impact of the face.
At one point, however, he struck him so strongly and directly into the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was the morning, I didn't expect it, immediately came down from my nose," Ladislav commented on the situation.
The colleagues and producers said the situation on the spot was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav failed to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so serious that it affected the continuation in another film.
The young artist's video clip we're bringing to you now, you can also record the hit scene.
Undeclared version of blood, but it wasn't better used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomačenko spoke at the meeting about the possibilities of mutual duel
Vasyl Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the latest boxing game in a light vase, first met at the Tuesday meeting.
Each of them was located in a separate room in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia - the unbeatable champion in a light vase World Boxing Council - went down to the hall where he welcomed Lomačenka, a champion in a pairing vase World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-person World Champion Adrian Broner in the Saturday match at Showtime, both boxers got on the list of the five best boxers in a light vase.
Garcia drew his line and said: “How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
The strike is held on Saturday at 19: 00 a.m. title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN.
The boxers pose for photographers and the manager of the Egis Climate Breaker adds that the potential fight of the boxers would be a "perfect test".
"I'm an ex-gammon champion in a steam plant," Garcia adds.
"Because of the Broner fight (67 kg), I had to make it, but I'm not that big.
I'm small on my 63 kg.
I'd like to go back to the category of light weights.
The brakes have to get back to get to a light weight... then we can fight.
The fans are looking for that.
Why don't they do it."
He's in agreement with you.
"The box would benefit from this game."
The climate has demanded a payment for the survey - which is part of its strategy. The winner should graduate his debut in a light bond at the end of this year and next year fight with Garcio (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against the winner of the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who competes on 23 September on the title in a light bond in the Forum arena.
"The strike should take place in the style of the payout for watching, as the fans are asking," said Garcia, who later said that it is open to launch a game through a television station that comes with the best offer.
“We are the main attractions.
No one else will draw such attention to themselves.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognized the Roman as a "wonder boxer" and could participate in his Saturday match.
But when he said that the three-division champion from Riverside seemed "very slow... I'm sorry about Mike, but you're talking about knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then a box.
Both boxers found that they felt a growing tension in front of each other’s duel.
"You will not forget this game.
No other match will pay so much attention to itself.
And with great comfort, I will put myself in the fire," said Garcia.
Romanceko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey."
It'll be a great match."
A young couple of years ago disappeared without a trace.
Their cars have now been found at the bottom of Volhy.
Two young Russians Ilia Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been mistaken since December 2005.
There was widespread persecution after them, but without success.
And the police finally ended the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty, not knowing what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the whole story became sad.
The rage of their car was found on the bottom of the Volga River in the city of Čekboksary in Čuvashska.
Thanks to the documents left in the car, the police managed to identify a few.
The evidence survived the whole decade under the water, without them it would take the police a long time to find the identity of the found.
A couple were last watched when he borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The heater that the car discovered remains anonymous.
He reported his findings to the Chechnya police who pulled the car out on the beach the next day.
The investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident that caused the smooth road around the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be published after its completion.
Latest results of tests to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of asylum-seekers' tests in Sweden, which have been detailed in the new method of their age, show that over 80 percent of people were questioned as older than 18 years, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
Swedish Medical Agency (Rätsmedicinalverket) started new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to give a more accurate assessment of asylum applications. The measure was adapted after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the right age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases to the investigation and the Forenz Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) was considered to be 18 years old, while in another 25 cases the forensic medical agency concluded that the question was "may be 18 years old".
In the next 423 cases, it was decided that the question was "maybe 18 years old".
Tests shall be available only if the age of the questionnaire is controversial.
According to Johan Gâransson of the Forenz Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"In contrast to last month, statistics are held in busy circles and numbers are very similar," The Local stated.
A higher number of refugees, whose age was estimated to be 18 years old, does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that "the person concerned is 18 years of age or older".
News Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the person concerned stated that he was 18 years old.
Critics have also been seen in the medical method of determining age, which includes X-rays of wisdom and MRI scans of knee joints, which are subsequently suspected by dentists and X-rays.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, is involved in assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age when the person in question went through puberty.
"I had reason to think about this issue and I do not think that these types of measures to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very insignificant.
If we can't determine the age with accuracy, we shouldn't imagine the opposite," Metro reported.
Forensic medical agency Agency's Gâransson defended the decision of the word: “In general, the risk of misassessment of the child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is that the person in question is below the limit of 18 years, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all those in question."
Trump was threatening the president of Mexico on the phone.
American President Donald Trump, in an ice-cold phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peño, threatened not to meet him if he would say publicly that his country would not pay for the building of a wall between the United States and Mexico.
The trumpet in the interview said that funding was somehow being arranged, even though he admitted it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
It comes from the interviews that The Washington Post released on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his last election campaign.
In the first conversation with the Mexican President shortly after the arrival of the Trump Peněu Neta's office, there was no diplomatic charge that he was critical of his plan to build a wall.
He cured the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to say to the public that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this press," said Trump repeatedly in a conversation on 27 January and threatened to interrupt contacts with the Mexican president if he continues to issue a positive statement.
Financing's gonna come up with something and eventually it's gonna work out.
"But if you're gonna say that Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to meet you gentlemen anymore, because it's unacceptable for me," said the American newspaper Trump.
Now he has identified the most important thing we're talking about, but politics may be the most important thing.
The executive order for the building of the Trump wall issued shortly after the power was taken over.
Mexico's construction and financing of the wall, which is 3200 kilometers long, has also been undermined by relations between the two countries.
At the end of March Trump said the project will be paid by the United States.
The Trump finally met with his Mexican opponent for the first time at the July G20 Summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on 28 January.
The Chief of the White House has called the conversation a joke.
To that end, he was granted an exchange of views on the agreement that Australia would provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the acceptance by the United States of persons from international facilities in the Pacific States.
Trump first considered the agreement stupid, but later he came to it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the agreement you have made, but you will have to stick to it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passages, telephone conversations with Turnbull were almost vociferous, for example when Trump assessed as a good idea of Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving on board.
"You're worse than me," yelled Trump.
There's been an outbreak of this conversation.
"I hate the reception of these people," Trump noted.
I assure you they're wrong.
That's why they're in jail now.
"There won't be great people going to work for local dairy," he said.
In the interview, he also stressed that in five years the refugee could become an assassin from Boston.
The Trump led at the end of January, about a week after coming to the White House, telephone conversations with a number of world citizens, often during a few days.
Turnbull's talk finally marked it as the least pleasant one in the whole day.
Before he finished, he said he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin before.
In front of the lady, they fixed ranny's killer.
And her father was watching.
The repair was carried out in the main town of Yemen Sana.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose for his sacrifice a small Ran Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Mahrabi took the girl, took her father's home, where he raped her, and shook her with his bare hands.
Next, he raped her body, which then hits close to the mixture.
The violent death of a little girl struck the whole country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first row of a thousand - head gift that met to be a witness to repair.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi was convicted under the law of the Sharia.
The victim's father, after repair, told the media of his feelings.
I feel like I'm born again.
I've got it.
It's the new day of my life.
The other family members were present, along with the crowd, to utter the word "to live righteousness".
The shoplifter brought in a police van that he was removed from.
The cops put him on the stomach.
One of his supporters turned his weapon against him and fired fire from the immediate vicinity.
The present mob celebrated every wound that was fired.
Mr. al Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and the right of the broads won," he added.
I was at the Sana discharge station waiting to repair my daughter's murder.
Then we and our family went to the morgue.
We took Ranina's little body and buried it in a nearby graveyard.
My wife Jamilah and I are grateful that justice was done.
The police were afraid that the mob gathered in the square would fall into the hate madness, the killer would fall and go wrong.
The correction was made by a court under the control of the Shiite Huti.
Originally, however, Magrabi was sentenced to 100 wounds immediately after his arrest, but his act sparked such a rebellion that the judge decided to punish him death.
Al Mahrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on 27 June.
The wound family knew him well.
When the police searched his house store, she found evidence that a man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
And the animal would be more merciful to the Early.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injury that ran over ran's body was terrible," said the media.
"The morning went away in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspaper and all our television stations, the posters with her picture hung everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got the guy from the killer parents who suspected their son of a terrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamilah, must have been hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body was found.
In the morning, she was playing outside with other children from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took our cars and drove around, but we were looking hard.
The inhabitants of Yemen were executed as a crime and began to gather before the police station where al Mahrabi was held, and to demand immediate punishment.
The representative of the Ministry of Justice read the present report on the investigation in order to calm it.
The accused, according to all his actions, did not express his regret.
Just before the execution of the sentence, the police had read his sentence, but the defendant had only been looking at his repairer for years.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were many videos on the Internet that he ordered.
Governor West Virginia announced a political change
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening at President Trump's meeting that he is going to the other side.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," Governor Justice said.
"Today, after a long prayer and reflection, I announce to you... today as a citizen of West Virginia, I say that I can no longer support you from the position of a democratic governor."
The attitude of the viewers exploded with joy.
"I will join the Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you that it's time to jump into another match."
Trump had already promised people an important announcement at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which is the only billionaire for Forbes in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large property from his father and owns several coal mines.
The value of his property is estimated at $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee, in the meantime, issued a statement on Thursday evening, which stated: "The overthrow of the governor of Justice is another morning for a democratic party that puts us in the way rather than forcing our country to be raised."
"For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and has at least the rule of law in history, the Governor Justice's announcement is the last step for such a hungry party without a leader who is reluctantly trying to find positive and unified news," RNC President Ronna McDaniel's statement for CBS News said.
Sebastian Coe commends Russia's "extreme" apology for the doping scandal
The former excellent sportsman Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for an honest apology for the doping scandal, but repeated that there was no right time for Russia to return to the sports world.
The head of the Russian athletes Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place in the championship last night - that his country's expulsion from the sport world was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized “to all the athletes who thus became gold and silver medals.”
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining a ban that entered into force in November 2015 after World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) reported that Russia supported doping its athletes.
"I think we have witnessed very honest answers and presentations today," IAAF Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All members of the Council and Congress were delighted to see Russia admit her mistake and work with all the strengths to repair and restore the proper function of the entire federation."
Coe said he was also "enjoyed", that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think that today has been very successful and we have taken a further step, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff to maintain the punishment that was imposed on Russia," Coe added.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate upright athletes from those who are not sincere," he finished his speech.
On the MS in the athletes, which starts in London on Friday, will compete under the neutral flag of 19 Russian athletes who have complied with the strict rules of the IAAF.
The head of the IAAF crisis team Rune Andersen said Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before it is allowed back.
The drug presence tests are still inadequate and the exclusion of coaches continues to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF board's presentation ended.
The Czech Trade State contract was awarded by Františka Savova, whose state is in charge.
The CzechTrade State Pro-Export Agency's public contract was awarded the publication of the Young Front Františka Savova.
Officials gave him a hundred percent point in all the qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state was charging Savova for tax fraud and asking for his release to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the Czech Trade Ministry of Industry and Industry wrote in April a public contract for the four-year editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
A total of 30.8 million crowns were awarded to the publisher of the Young Front of Entrepreneur Františka Savova.
The Czech police have already accused him of tax evasion in 2014.
Savov fled to the United Kingdom and Czech Republic asked for his release.
For the case, the server has now been alerted.
According to the original CzechTrade criteria, the award was to be made at 60% of the proposed price and the remaining 40 beauty competitions, i.e. the quality of the project.
However, the second criterion has helped Savov’s company significantly.
According to Dotyk.cz, she received a hundred points in all the partial criteria.
This was the result of the move in front of another candidate, the publisher Vltava Lab Media VLM, who offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with 404 900 crowns a month, VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it was obtained from the assessors in all the qualitative criteria of the mean assessment, a total of 62 points.
The trend has continued to be attended by BDO Advisory consultants and the R-Media Digital Agency, which also belongs to the current.cz server under the publication of the Economy.
VLM’s publication has opposed the trend by several objections, considering its assessment to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
Following their refusal, it was decided to attack competition with the Office for the Protection of the ÚOHS Competition.
The Czech Trade is believed to have acted in violation of the law.
"The proponent is convinced that the proponent has reached a decision on the choice of the supplier of a public contract based on the risk of subjective assessment, a clearly favourable participant of the Mlada Front, etc., to the sponsor and other suppliers," the proposal for the start-up of the procedure submitted to the ÚOHS this week, which published the server Currently.
According to VLM Director-General and Chairman of VLM Michal Klima, the pointing of the election commission appears as an incredible and thorough evaluation of the Young Front project among all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miracle success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious," said the current Climate.
The Czech Trade has not yet come into the situation.
The Czech Trade Agency essentially does not comply with public orders before their closure.
All information about you is published in the Contacter's Profile and in the Public Order Journal in accordance with the law.
"After the end of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract, we cannot express ourselves in its course," said Dotyk.cz Media Representative of the Agency Štěpán Dlouhý.
The young front responded by saying that it considered it extremely problematic that the publication of the Economy hit an article in Actualno.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, that fact was set out in that Article.
In the trend, she could have helped to provide a BusinessInfo portal in the past four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Commerce led the Martim Kuba ODS.
Františka Savova blames the police for tax evasion in connection with the excessive tax returns of his company, which caused the Czech state to damage up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has requested the United Kingdom to issue it since 2014.
According to Savova, the head of the ANO andrej Babish movement, under whose influence is the Mafra publishing.
The London court of last year rejected Savov's appeal for extradition, but the businessman declined.
"From our point of view, the case has not gone anywhere since yesterday, from Britain we have not received any understanding in the matter of obtaining the legal power of the judgment so far," Štepánka Zenklova, a spokesman for the Prague State Department of State, said.
In addition to the ownership of the Mladé front, Savov was established in Harvey Limited with a settlement in Cyprus, which was owned by the Czech Buddhist brewery Samson, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, purchasing dangerous assets.
It should also be owned by Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, who owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the extraction of property from some socialist youth bond.
The motorbike drove by the sidewalks and the park, ended up in the quarries.
The motorbike turned its attention to an unspoiled road trip along the streets, pedestrians and park trails in Ošović.
When she began to watch him, he decided to take her to the State Hall.
"Police men followed the city with increased caution when on one of the roadsides behind the Marian Laznies failed to manage and took the motorcycle into the field where he was having a chance," police spokesman Daniel Dvořák said.
Finally, he had to fly to a rescue helicopter that transported the injured motorbike to the Plenary Hospital.
After the police found that the driver’s driver’s license, the registration marks on the motorcycle were cut off, his production number was deleted and his own product label was removed.
It's possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is the subject of another investigation.
"In the shower test, the presence of alcohol in the driver was excluded, but the test found a positive result on the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesperson added.
How financial rules of football affect the move of Neymara to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs are in no way detracting from Neyar's record transition from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalisation for Paris Saint-Germain will be carried out by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Masters' List.
Financial fair play (FFP ) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 provide that the PSG will have to demonstrate that the Neymar crossing was not financed without significant losses.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million only for buying Neymara out of his contract and Neymar will require a payment of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
It follows a number of financial conditions of Neymar's transition to France.
Given that the PSG team is funded by a rich cataract family that has enriched its energy sales, it can allow Neymara to be brought into such star football families.
Clubs can be lost for the purchase of players of huge amounts, but on the other hand they have to demonstrate the legal resources of revenue, which enables them to cover the direct costs of trading activities related to football.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after reaching the EUFA Director’s table in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that are in a cave after the new forces are ultimately cheated and risked bankruptcy if the banks or owners refuse to secure.
In 2011, the rules of the FFP redirected its attention from club debts to monitoring their loss.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and losing Horant sums for players and building a global brand - was not so beneficial at all.
During the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may lose up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor, Alexander Czeferin, is determined to defend the prohibition of excessive loss.
"The FFP law is still applicable and we are deciding to strengthen it in the future," said the Associated Press Andrea Traverso last week, who is monitoring compliance with FFP rules.
Although the PSG paid the amount for the purchase of Neymara in one-off payment, the amount may be distributed for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neimar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44,4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of FFP's highest sanctions was won in 2014 by PSG with Manchester City, which owns Abu Dhabi's group.
The PSG was reduced to EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and ordered to reduce the skill of the League of Masters to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is paying attention to teams that can try to maintain financial regulators by visiting their revenues through companies associated with the owner of clubs.
Even though the company of Qatar sponsors the PSG as soon as funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the calculation of the amount.
A similar measure was introduced by UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funding provided by Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
The share of Neimar revenue in the PSG could be offset, according to some reports, by the Organizational Commission of MS in the football of 2022 in Qatar.
However, the PSG and the representatives of MS 2022 in Katara rejected the fact that Neymat should become an MS ambassador in football and that such a manoeuvre would easily be discovered by UEFY actors.
The previous sanctions imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to comply with the rules,
According to UEFA’s Tuesday statement, Neymara did not conduct any investigations into the PSG in the case of a breach.
The report's source wanted to remain anonymous, as the situation with PSG is not allowed to comment, the Agency stated the Associated Press.
The latest published accounts show that the PSG closed in 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymara to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling clothes.
The contract signing club promises an increase of up to 30 percent.
The representatives of the Spanish league, obviously concerned with the departure of one of the largest stars, sought to stifle Neymar's departure, arguing that the PSG violates the rules of the FFP.
"It is a clear case of a ‘financial doping’ club and the state," said President La Ligy Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG club as a Turkish syndicate.
Arsenal's manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns American sports magnet, shares the same position La Ligy about financing the club.
"It is the consequence of ownership that has changed the football world from the foundations in the last 15 years," Wenger heard on Thursday.
"As soon as the club owner becomes a owner, everything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of the fair play is very difficult, because the state may have different interests in participating such players in its club."
Spartan Deputy Russian: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand cheering fans on their feet.
Here's the Russian going to the square.
The same scene as in the Sunday fight against Bohemians.
The Spartan hostage turned against the Red Star game, invented several heads, but his associates did not turn into black.
The Latvian team, pumped by new multimillion forces, ends up after the start-up doubles in European cupboards.
Was it hard to do anything else after the Belgrade branch?
After the incassated throat, four were to be shot, which was hard for us.
At least we wanted not to lose, to raise our self-awareness, so that we could avoid other fights.
We had a chance.
We need to work together as a team and move our game.
Why didn't Sparta get into the fight that long?
The game is very designed.
The rival's combinations were much better than ours.
We didn't get anything, we shot once in a while.
Of course, it's very little when you have to win two or three balls.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push the rivals more often into such positions.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the structure?
Of course, it's one of the pain when there's a new skill.
We've only played three competitions and the composition is still changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect eleven to sit down.
Is it an encouragement to you that you've already played part of two games for yourself?
They're still just part of the game.
I don't know how my condition will develop and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that happened in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise it doesn't work.
It's the same as the injury.
If you don't believe it, you can't come back.
Sparta has decided somehow, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fanatics came back in large numbers, but they left in despair.
What can you show them?
There was a wonderful visit again, as well as with God.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with better performance.
Bring in something that'll make them come next.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I was here 15 years ago.
Can the season without a cup be at least a benefit to the league?
While we're fighting ourselves, we're complaining, so it's not such a benefit for us.
In case of extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur shall stay for ten years.
The Constitutional Court has rejected the complaint of Jiří Toman, who has a considerable amount of tax to dismiss ten years in prison.
The estimated damage is 645 million crowns.
Toman claimed in his complaint that justice violated his fundamental law, the actual finding of the courts in Zlín and Olomouci are completely incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Courts identified the complaint as unjustified, found the Court's database of the Court of Justice.
The U.S. is not another court of appeal.
"It is not possible as a fourth instance to assess the actual or legal concerns which have allegedly been permitted by the general courts, if they do not represent violations of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict is valid since November 2015 when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouk.
At that time, Toman was in the issuing prison in Argentina, where he was also in the time of the U.S. decision, according to the resolution.
The penalty imposed on the upper limit of the legal rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court referred the case to the extreme tax evasion which has even a macroeconomic impact on the State budget.
In 2005 to 2008, the man acted as President of the World Service.
The damage of 645 million crowns occurred only in the period from January to July 2008, the total loss was estimated to be over billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman in full.
According to the complaint, World Service did not include all the invoices in its tax receipts.
Instead of monthly deductions, VAT and consumer taxes in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns paid tax in only statistics.
The World Service and some companies with which the company was dealing have a relationship with a company named Radomír elector, whose court has measured the handling of VAT in transactions with fuel tanks for 13 years of prison.
His complaint was also rejected before the time of the Constitutional Court.
The series "Flight to the Unforeseen" and "Comrade Detective" are playing on the nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for the statues of the famous 80s; for the dirty 90s (when genius David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the "The State" comedy sketch on MTV; and of course for modern times, especially in 2001, before stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went into major projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the incarnation of our modern facebook era of permanent memories.
Frankly, it looks like someone's breathing.
The "First Day of Camp" series worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (for example, it can be a story about the creation of a talker with a vegetable that H. Jon Benjamin spoke of).
The authors have turned away from the main funny point - middle-aged players who play teenage pregnant children - and could not escape from the past.
The continuation of "Ten Years Later" in which adults are playing the adults do not push so much on emotional balance and satire is places to sporadic, including parodys on thrillers from the 90s as "Ruka on colébque".
At one point, the building will be located at the Apple Powerbook Haraburds, Cinderellas and "a lot of other things from 1991".
Many main lines of history are repeated.
Well-being Coop (Mr. Shawalter), now writer, has not yet moved through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor is still panicking.
Not to mention the crazy puzzle that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Shawalter), who encourages George H. W. Bush (very well-contained Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of French is many stories on the other side.
It's especially fun to watch forever young Rudda with long hair alias bet Matt Dillon from the film Young, whose once respected Andy's bet is now a paprika.
Francis could start the moments of random madness, as if the series "Seven Up" would be back, until he reaches what I suppose will be a logical reflection: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when the whole group is finally released on the "Flight to the Unforeseen".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon also appeals to another type of nostalgia: Revivalism of Cold Wars of the series "Takoví normal Americané", the film "Atomic Blonde: No Regret" and even the series "GLOW", in which the icons of East and West Wrestling scene are held.
The comedy of the creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka in Rhyse Thomase's mode is to act as a television show: a drama by two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 80th century who fight for truth and atheism by way of Marxism-Lenins.
The main roles - new Gregor and idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Street, which were produced in the English language Channing Tatum (a successful serial producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
In some jokes you smile (like policemen watching jokes on TV - parody on American football).
The series lent its voice to many well-known actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
The Comrade Detective, however, focuses too much on the unscrupulous propaganda drama - which includes a killer with a Reagan mask - and it also looks like it.
Six long episodes are too disruptive and comedy moments are not enough.
At a short walk, the propaganda satire in the "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in the scene when Gregor and Joseph repeatedly visit the United States of America, in which the two fats in the halls wave the hamburgers on a large pile.
A clear message for the imaginary communist obscurity is that Western culture can transform everything into a castle and an orgy.
The thinking of Romanian manufacturers was not wrong: we do as much with our own culture as with theirs.
The Russian athletes did not expect to cancel the start ban from the IAAF.
The IAAF International Athletic Federation at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on Russian race starters for the state-supported doping programme.
The vote in the event of the World Championship, which begins on Friday, was very clear, as expected.
For the duration of the ban, 166 delegates spoke against only 21 votes.
The main reason for the rejection is the fact that Russia cannot meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as the head of the special investigation group IAAF Rune Andersen found before the congress.
His group recommended that the ban be continued.
Some of the older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard, and coaches still work in the country with shameless stories.
Not yet fully functional is the Russian Anti-Doping Agency RUSADA, which does not meet the World Anti-Doping Agency standards.
However, under the supervision of foreign experts and British Anti-Doping Agencys, RUSAD may carry out testing.
"Even though progress has been made, there is still much work to be done," said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic federation was suspended in November 2015, and the Russian athletes came to include last year's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming MS, 19 Russians were involved, who had already demonstrated that they had been tested for a longer time outside the Russian anti-doping system.
At the championship, they won't be able to start in national colors, and in the case of victory, they won't be able to play Russian hymna.
The Bank of England will support the interest rate of 0,25 %
The Bank of England should, as expected, announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following a sharp economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has led to speculation about rapid growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain "in the background" in relation to the maintenance of the interest rate - despite the burning of family budgets.
The policy makers of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six times two times to keep the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the voting for the increase in the interest rate were supported by strong economic growth supported by weak growth.
In its annual report on inflation, the Bank predicted a growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that lowering family budgets would continue.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that over the next few years it should grow as a result of inflation caused by Brexit and also indicated that the rents from the mouth should increase more in financial markets than expected.
The Committee also voted in favour of downloading part of the mammoth package, whose task was to support the economy and which was put into practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, it should begin to pay the plan for future financing, which will offer cheap grants to banks, although the Bank of England has stated that the planned $115 billion now will offer £15 billion less.
Just prior to the decision, the Bank stated: "MPC predicts that a gross domestic product (HDP) will be stagnant in the short term with the pressure on real household income and consumption burden."
On the subject of the Bank's bid, it stated that there would be a need to "remove the notes of monetary policy" to calm inflation, which is "to a greater extent" than the markets expect.
Markets currently predict first growth in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "allowable" and "limited".
The Bank reduced the forecast of growth for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% of the forecast in May.
The projected growth in 2018 remained unchanged at 1,8 %.
After the estimates were published, the pound fell to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $1.31 and by 0.4 % to €1.11.
The decision to maintain the current status came after the more disappointing growth buried hope for further growth - HDP stopped at 0,3 % in the second quarter, compared to 0,2 % of the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0,3 % in the third quarter, although by the end of the year the Bank should be slightly increased.
The latest report on inflation is a lack of comfort for households affected by rising inflation and poorly rising wages. The bank has stated that the situation is even worse before growth.
The report further states that monetary policy cannot "stop" revenue cuts in the coming years, but it is expected that the future will be "extensive" to the end of the three-year forecasts.
The economy should also increase due to the high interest in British goods due to the poor book, which compensates for the lower percentage of consumer expenditure.
This decision came year after the rate was reduced to 0,025 % in August in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which led to a reduction in the books.
The Bank estimates that the full price and economy will last at least four years.
Prior to the Bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded a rise in rates with rising inflation, which further increased the pressure on households. Three political actors demanded a 0.5% increase in June.
Inflation fell back to 2,6 % of June 2,9 %, even though the bank stated that such a change was expected and inflation should rise again during the next month.
The Bank stated that the 2 % target was "completely" due to the weak book.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, stated: “As a result of the recent drop in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to only stop once the believers begin to argue about contracts with a good view of the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end up with existing contracts and repo mortgages - the offer offers are options without fees, as well as the low rates they receive in the form."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV treatment in 10,000 patients
From September, patients will have access to ‘transformative’ treatment for HIV prevention on the basis of a decision of the highest NHS funding court.
The National Health Service (NSH) has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients up to 86%, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10,000 patients during the three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the appeal court supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year, stating that NHS had financial resources available to replace PrEP despite the declaration that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was taken by NHS England from the mouth of Director General Simon Stevens as a ‘significant intervention’, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described the decision as a ‘deciding moment’.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start taking patients. Other clinics will join in October and will come to full implementation across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine that is used to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of transmission of HIV among endangered patients.
PreEP before sex means that the patient’s body has a sufficient amount of specific medicines to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Among the tested patients are homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify eligible participants who have signed agreement with the participation in the testing, including men, women, transsexuals and individuals with a partner whose HIV status has not yet been controlled by the relevant treatment.
People living and registered at GP in the United Kingdom can also apply to their local sexual health clinic and keep a potential participation in testing.
The program will come to taxpayers at £10 million and NHS England signed this week the contract to distribute medicines after obtaining international public contracts.
The trial period is proposed for the collection of clinical evidence and the assessment of the full potential of PrEP, its target, use and implementation to a large extent.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should be complementary and fully difficult to constantly expand and the more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades' effort to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health."
Deborah Goldová, Executive Director of NAT (National AIDS Trust) said: “We are witnesses of the decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is correctly administered and patients at risk, it will offer the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic.
NSH will offer from September patients who are exposed to high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool, which is individually controlled and essential to reinterpret a partner, leading to the improvement of the quality of many lives.
We welcome this statement.'
Ian Green, Executive Director Terrence Higgins Trust said: “The number one priority must be rapid testing throughout the country; we must ensure that it is available to each patient.
We now have a PrEP trial medicine and we are on a good path to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.'
The shadow health ministry Sharon Hodgson said: "The beginning of the trial period PrEP is welcome and long expected to change after months of postponement and suspension by the government.
Evidence indicates how transformative this medicine can be a part of our approach to HIV prevention and the end of the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The following tests will lead us to a step closer to a full understanding of the PrEP benefits.
Now it is important that we start tests as soon as possible throughout the country and protect those who are exposed to HIV and, together, end the spread of HIV in society."
Life on high feet: interspare and smart design changed this small apartment at the Earls Court in a spacious house
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 for an apartment on Earls Cour.
It is located on the first floor of the smart Queen Anne terrace - and is a visual display of modern design that uses maximum space available.
"I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge, last year," Joanne said.
"I've been looking for something more reasonable.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and had the same height of the ceiling.
I fell in love with him right now, and I was staring at him the same day."
Since then, the apartment has been in the size of 1,000 meters of complete renovations.
The one-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get to the bedroom, you had to go to the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage spaces and interspatriate to use a high ceiling.
“I applied for a high ceiling, large windows and a lot of lights.
Such were my requirements," she said.
For this purpose, Erfan Azadi from the design and design studio Duck & Shed was based in Notting Hill and used almost four-metre roof to create a home that was not only a project but also a place to live.
Strap failed to reach such heights that two gaps would come up - a challenge for architects so it was to create an interspatire on which to walk straight.
Erfan must have been involved in his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is completely complicated," he explained.
"We had to arrange both rooms so that we could walk straight.
It wasn't just to build a simple platform, but at the same time to wrap the steel structure so that the right height is above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two suitable rooms on its own - and at the same time add to the drama.
In the intermarriage, there is a beautiful living room with an old meridian frame in the design of Retrovius.
The mirror furniture in gold color, silver line and retro mirror Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and enlightenment.
The short walk is measured mirrored on both sides and looks so much longer.
The mirror leaves in the kitchen look like a window into another room.
In the entrance doors there are storage spaces of mirrors designed to be fitted with fixtures and glass.
The advantage of a living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
Convenient kitchens are nothing new.
What's unique about this solution, however, is a locker door.
"We had to solve the technical site," Erfan says about the decorated doors.
"The door is designed to be counterweighted to be very easy."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne has gained another 16 meters of square, second room and better overall accommodation.
"When it comes to this, what you sell is the residential area - or the valuation of your property," Erfan said.
‘The real broker shall, in principle, calculate its price on the basis of the residential area at the time of entry into the apartment.’
In this case, the residential area has been able to be increased in the preservation of quality materials that contribute to the area of luxury vision.
"Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional mood with your home," Erfan added.
“You don’t like the divorces of electricity in the walls.
Yes, they're important, but your heart doesn't win."
As it turns out, quality design and the increase of the living space can change the usual apartment for exceptional work.
And just like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is joining.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on the travel of its citizens to the state of Tennessee and other seven states.
The State of Tennessee paid her and issued a legal ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, it is not a ban in full terms of meaning that citizens of the United States can travel freely throughout the 50 states.
This is about California's banning state money from its citizens' travels to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strong for LGBT and any manifestations of non-compliance with the life-style LGBT considers discrimination.
Tennessee, however, has passed a law on the protection of conscience, which states that psychotherapy, which has a moral problem with the treatment of patients in the LGBT community, is not obliged to provide it, but is obliged to ensure that these patients have another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and the other States have again adopted laws under which religious charitable organizations, who have received children from their mothers after birth for adoption, do not have the obligation to grant adoption to the same sex couples.
As a result of these laws on compensation for California's conscience, California has banned the financing of its citizens' travels to the eight states of the Union from its resources.
In practice this means that California professors must not have access to scientific symposia, for example in Texas, paid from their universities because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions such as Tennessee with financial support from their schools.
On the road they must get either federal grants, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance citizens from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The State of Tennessee has come to the forbearance and its parliament has passed a law with a resolution that it does not like California's policies of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and the tolerance of illegal immigrants, yet the travel embargo does not fall due to this in California.
It's turning them into a kidnapping for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to every state of the Union, which would otherwise have ordered a similar travel ban for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the fact, now comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is anti-constitutional.
States shall have the right to adopt laws on the protection of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go on and what it will not.
Second, what's wrong with the conscience?
If a hunter has a religious problem selling mushrooms, why not offer only beef, lamb, poultry, and fish?
Why should he be forced to sell under the penalty even if there is enough of the hunters offering the bull?
In the state of Colorado, one baker faces an anti-discrimination complaint and a high fine because he refuses to pay a tribute to a homosexual wedding.
But he also refuses to buy a cake for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why should he be punished and not allowed to be ordered by hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic policies in powers that are not federal, according to their own, i.e. according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT community have at times legitimately applied tolerance to their lifestyle.
Today many members of this community are governed by the rule of life and let them live, which all reasonable people should rule, but some activists never try to tolerate themselves and others, but extreme intolerance to others.
As a result, no one can ever show a moral, religious or philosophical conflict with LGBT's lifestyle, and if they do so, they must be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is total.
They're new enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I don't know the situation in American history when the States did this for political issues, except in the case of one.
Even in the times of the civil rights struggle of blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of the congregation, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was the 50th century, the political cause of slavery, and the North War against the South.
Of course, nothing like that will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the blue democratic and the red republican states is deepening and the United States is mentally expanding.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putina's critic got a fat knife.
Russian opposition policy Alexei Navalnyj received 300 thousand rubles for violating the campaign's rules before the presidential elections, which will take place next year.
The court imposed a fine on him for urging people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalnyy has organised two major anti-government street protests in the last two months and announced that he wants to take charge of the state's post in March next year.
Chief Kremlu Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to him in the morning and brought him to court.
He's the one who gave him the credit for calling people for demonstrations through videos posted on the YouTube Internet portal.
The slaughter is three hundred thousand.
"Let's cut them off from the judge's pay," he joked on the Twitter critic Kremla.
The Russian Election Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential elections because he had previously been convicted of treason.
Navalnyj, who is considered a combatant against corruption, is, however, considered to be politically motivated.
The 300 thousand rubles, 25 thousand rubles of the court's sentence on Thursday, was also filed with two members of the Naval pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalnyj entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant character on the scattered opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend the Naval in the campaign as much as possible.
In February, he was sentenced to five years of conditional punishment for stealing from the forest company Kirovles.
In May, the verdict confirmed the appeal court.
The judgement is so valid that Navalni is against running under Russian law.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the foundation of their Italian family empire, cover one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth over $500 million.
Former director Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis is staying in Toorak, only three rooms from his younger brother Paula, who was in dispute about joint property and commercial property to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in 2014, but the sharp dispute was constantly held before the highest court.
With her mother Anna, she owns a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store bought a family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwood.
In this place, a family of Westco Jeans, who grew into a network of 160 stone shops, was established.
In 1999, the family sold the company as a whole for $85 million.
Other properties and family portfolio De Lutis now includes offices, construction land in Brunswick and Sorrent, apartments on Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping center in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who according to Paul's words "a significant force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns two thirds of the assets.
The court records indicate that Colin owns a property of $316 million, while Paul manages a property of $176 million.
For Paul, the problem has just become the distribution of assets and funds.
"Colin's proposal was pronounced in my eyes in particular for his benefit," Paul wrote in a court-martial statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts on peace, the first session of the Supreme Court took place.
Now brothers are also struggling to control the existing business - from which Paul cut out Colin, according to his statement.
Colin resists the fact that it is not true and accuses Paul of misbehaving with certain properties.
In Colin's previous interim statement, he said he believed in a fair solution to the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates to me that the family is one of the most important," he wrote.
The costs of the courtroom are rising. Hundreds of pages of cross-border statements, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, sail lawyers, including Allana Myerse, QC and supporters of both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had been operating milk bars and drawers since the 50th century and in the 70th century bought a farm in Brunswick.
They bought property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans for money.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in the last year of high school, Paul was still a young, about 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutisová stated that together with Luigim, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of the property to the sons would go well.
“Lugi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Another two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the group of the De Lutis family. Colin stated that at his departure Mark was compensated for 10 million dollars and Luke for 26 million dollars.
As Paul, Luke and Mark stated, “they were not satisfied with the conditions of their financial compensation”.
Colin has been holding back since then, despite the fact that he is a former member of the AFL club’s representation, as he introduced in his 2015 autobiography Eddie McGuire, known as the television personality and best friend Colina.
Fairfax Media contacted Colina and Paula de Lutisova and their lawyers on Friday.
He answered only by means of Colin's textual report, which stated that given the fact that the dispute was dealt with before the court, "I have nothing to add".
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to settle the whole matter before the court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in a statement by Judge Colin, he made an effort to adapt to his brother’s requirements.
"Our father would be very unhappy if he could see our current situation," he listened and added that he still "hoped in a wise solution".
On Friday, all hopes were inconceivable.
"Our disputes will resolve in a short time trial," Colin wrote.
Wind in the Czech Republic.
Teachers are showering kids.
MDD drivers are fashioning water and summer clothing.
At the school of the mother at Chodovci in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, she only walks out in the morning.
The shell is reconstructed and dried trees do not yet provide a large shade.
There's no pool there, but the kids are showering at the mill.
In the afternoon, the children stay in classes where they are charged with jaundice and hidden curtains.
The air is trying to cool clean air because they don't have air conditioning.
It's for teachers and cooks, too.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and the exterior, exceeds the hygiene limits for parental schools, so during this period we should not, in fact, have open operation," said the school director Miloslav Makovicová.
There's a damn corridor in the school where the temperature moves about 40 degrees.
We grow up in the morning after 6 o'clock, the windows are closed, and we have on the south side the jacuzzi we're protecting.
"But it won't help much," she added.
The best conditions are in the forest school in the Garden of Hostival, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have grown trees on the ground, so we're under them.
"We've got a beautiful fixture there, there's a table under it, and there we're doing different things," said school director Barbara Kompan.
Teachers and children are trying to go to the woods where there's a bigger boy.
The kids have wet hats and different water games on the program.
"We have a hand-pressed questionnaire, which is used for flowering, and we use it for children's showering," said Kompanová.
Also, the director of the mother's school in Novoborská Street at the Prague Prosek Jitka Vilimovská said that teachers try to keep them in the shade and drop them in the water.
"We have a relatively large garden, so they're under the trees there," she said.
It goes out in the morning and then after 15 o'clock.
Every child must have a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
For example, they can choose a small cup of tea or a regular juice and have a drink of water in the garden.
Every day, they also have a vegetable salad and fresh fruit and vegetables that parents sometimes bring.
"Well, maybe today one mother here brought about a tenth melon for the kids," Makovicová added.
Drivers get water or summer cologne.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with hot days of water, ion drinks or summer cots.
The driver's cabs also trams buses are in most cases air-conditioned, DPP spokesperson Aneta Sræková.
Air conditioned apart from the cabin, some trams are also in the passenger space.
Tramway colleges of high temperatures have not been seriously damaged so far.
There was a small damage in the shed in Hostivaří.
At present high temperatures, we take care, in particular, that drivers have enough drinks available.
"Clouded drinking water is available in all the smears, smearing points and corridors," the Реhková said.
There are so-called sodas that produce a cooled soda in the driver's car and in some parking spaces.
Drivers also get soluble ion protection drinks.
"They can also use an annual uniform that increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts," the speaker added.
The hot and dry weather of the last days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, their fires were liquidated throughout the Czech Republic by 108, i.e. a double of the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, the day the temperatures in the Czech Republic exploded over 35 degrees Celsius, the firefight was mainly waged by fire.
"They consider fires in the natural environment as well as those that are connected with men's jobs," said the speaker of the firemen Nicole Zaoralová.
The influence of the firemen did not bring a night shift of weather, when the heat in a series of places was sparkled by storms and waves.
In connection with the storms, firemen drove out to 236 raids.
It was particularly about the removal of fallen trees and plants.
"They were no longer engaged in the Middle East," Zaoralová continues.
But the help of firefighters was also needed in the Svolínkas in Czechoslovakia, where for storms they evacuated 60 people from their childhood camps.
Tropical temperatures also assigned work to the Prague rescuers.
On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the toilets ran out to dozens of cases of oxygen poisoning with a fever.
That's why people should let their water heaters check, protect their lifeguards.
The oxidised is a colourless gas without smell, which relaxes in imperfect burning.
Symptoms of the poison include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling dizzy.
In case of suspicion of poisoning, leave the frozen room.
Trump's new head of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet
Many have tried it before him and have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, it'll be the first.
The Portal Politico stated that the new Chief of Staff in the White House is planning to limit the information of President Trump - including reports in television reports - in hopes that Trump will maintain his hunger.
Here is part of the report by the reporter Josh Dawseye:
“When the new Chief of Staff of the White House John F. Kelly met the first day in the new office with the staff, he created the key problem of Trump's White House, which is going to correct: incorrect information that is being given to the president.
Kelly informed the employees that he must personally approve all the information - whether in paper or in writing - because the President can decide on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but a lot of his predecessors are in control of Trump and his presentation broke out in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media is dating back several decades - and now that he sits in the White House, his habit of watching television news is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate was upset by honest reports, it was appropriate for him to show that in a positive light many other media are talking about him, which was easier to convince," said Politico Sam Nunberg, former campaign advisor in February.
Tara Palmeriová from the Politico portal then wrote that "the key to maintaining Trump tweets in trust - at least according to the words of six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media that sings praise to him."
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump's tendency to publish his views on Twitter was once "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something they don't know about - that Trump's tweets would be more exciting if someone didn't control them.
We'll never know about the tweets that Trump never left.
If his employees managed to keep him at least several times in trust, then their efforts did not go away.
However, no one has ever been able to prevent the Trumps regularly to raise controversial issues.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival groups, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by moving the Trumps to materials that they can, but do not have to be reliable, that support their world view.
The Policy Portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the willingness of advisers to submit questionable information to the head of the state.
This is an example of such information from the reporter Shane Goldmacher's pen:
“The current and former officials of Trump argue that the President often reacts very distraughtly to negative news from the media, especially to reports on the lack of information, and strives to find their origin.
This situation came at the end of February when someone supported the president with a copy of an article from GotNews.com - the provocative's website, Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of the staff of Katie Walsh of being "a source of many leaks of information" from the White House.
No matter that Johnson was always on Twitter for harassment; or that he did not submit his claim with any evidence; or that he had already made false accusations in the past and then called them back.
Trump read the article and started asking Wals.
Goldmaker added that the then Chief of Staff Reise Priebus and the Secretary of the White House of Rob Porter "were trying to implement the system for the management and documentation of information received by President Trump".
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to put forward the same strategy.
It turns out he's more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsivity doesn't just go away and his assistants are still struggling for power.
These non-changeable factors of Kelly's mission certainly bother you.
Tourists are negotiating abstinence and return to the "Millionary Quarter"
Several of the most affordable owners of the English county West Midland will again be allowed to travel with selected tourists, who negotiate with local authorities on the right to reclaim the fields behind their seats.
The tourists parked 20 caravans on the field at the beautiful streets of Solihull, which is called the “millionaire quarter”.
Bringing horses, children and the army of caravans, tourists will return after they have been shown in May. They did not even notice a trailer, which was dug up on site on the basis of a regulation of the authorities in order to prevent their entry.
The tactical group found spaces in the defense and penetrated the field with a caravan of unprotected spaces that served as the road.
As the inhabitants of the city of Solihull attacked, they “did not have the ability to solve the problem. ”
One of the residents who wanted to remain anonymous said: “They planted this place on Monday night after they were moved to the street of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones after other people.
The Governing Council should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they're back.
Last night the next one arrived, and today they'll probably get even more.'
She added that : ‘The Birmingham Governing Council knows how to impose this problem. To protect parks, it uses judicial orders.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't want to keep building taxes until the board of directors with tourists arranges.'
Another of the anonymous people said, "It's funny. We've just been watching the latest traveling tourists and now they're back.
And this time they're even more and this time they've brought horses with them.'
The press spokesperson of Solihull said: "We are aware of the unauthorized stay on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, we take the necessary legal steps to resolve the problem effectively.
In order to gather as many evidence as possible, it is necessary that as many locals as possible declare any inconsistencies or illegal conduct of the police on number 101.
We're going to get a whole picture that we're going to take to court.'
My husband hit a car in Brussels with a euro favor.
He's been brought by a government special.
The government specialist transported wounded Robert Žitňanski to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and the plane was under constant control of the Slovenian doctors.
For a long time, he hung himself without any complications.
Róbert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the year, according to information from TV JOJ.
He's been hit by a car and since then he's in a serious condition.
After transporting to the government, he was transported to a specialized workplace in one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of the Slovenian Euroslain Jany Žitňanski from NOVA.
She didn't want to talk about the incident.

Italians attach to the fight against the rescue ships of NGOs with immigrants on board
Italy has notified that it will prevent the arrival of the rescue ships of NGOs that are approaching the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean unless the NGOs sign new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue in their operations," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities had entertained the ship of the German rescue organisation Jugend Rettat for suspicion of trafficking with people, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which operates for the first year, refused to comment on the whole because of the accusation by the Italian State prosecutor Ambrogia Cartojoe.
“It is for us, and there will always be a priority number for a rescue of human lives, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the rescue zones at this time,” the organisation stated in a statement on social networks.
"All current charges can be commented only after collecting all the information and assessing the whole situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventa organisation Jugend Rettat since October.
Her crew is suspected of being carried on board by immigrants who have been transferred directly to human beings, and repeatedly.
At least one meeting was reportedly only 1.3 miles from the border of Libya. The meeting was published by the Italian media.
The crew of the ship is suspected of violating the law and was subject to the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area - from humanitarian enthusiasm, more than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board the ship, such as Juventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-governmental organisations involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last designated organisation on Thursday stated that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable, as they do not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" with regard to rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of a new code of conduct has also been rejected by doctors without borders (MSF), which is the holder of the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, Minniti has been told that the rapid decline of immigrants in the last few weeks who are displaced in Italy under rescue operations indicates that efforts to strengthen surveillance at the Libya coast and cooperation with local elders bear fruit.
"In the last days, we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He also identified plans for further negotiations that will take place this month with the old Libyans on economic development initiatives, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants left by these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Unforgivable Mesaroš: She had a silicone and a cellulite on the upper floor!
The hot summer days are all about taking on the most necessary part to cover the most intimate parts.
It's just Dominic Mesaroš doing it the other way.
At the afternoon meeting in the Prague Zoo, where the actors, moderators, singers and all they have to do with TV Prima, just the ice cream, they put their body in the mini-overall.
And there were only a few normal movements and the model showed all its silicas, but also a puzzle.
He overstepped her by the half, and he broke her so high that she had to fix it all the time.
The attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present certainly did not need to be paid.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages for suicide to Conrad Roye
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for encouraging her friend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, for 20 years, will stay for 15 months from a double-year sentence on the net and then spend five years in parole.
Carter was sentenced in June for the unimaginable murder of Conrad Roye, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Roy’s father said in court on Thursday: “The whole family is upset.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision was made.
She was threatened by 20 years of deprivation of liberty, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy had suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and creamy blouse, Carter was standing when declaring the verdict on the spot with tears in his eyes, his hands and his eyes directed towards the ground.
"She was killed by Conrad Roye," the judge said.
"She finished her life to take her own life.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any readings."
However, the legal representative of Carter said that it was “an unfortunate circumstance that he is uneasy about.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder do not have a significant impact on her performance”.
The complainant read Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy,’s statement: “Don’t run away one day so that I don’t grieve over the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I'm taking care of his sister and together we're going to suffer the unbearable pain that we're going to carry with us forever," he said.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy testified that she "followed" her conscience that she would never participate in the wedding and would never be his aunt's children.
"The loss of the person I've been seeing since I was born is the pain I'm going to bring to life," she said.
The State of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would force a person to commit suicide to another person.
Carter's was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 in the car seat, poisoned by carbon dioxide.
The case came to the attention of the entire nation after Carter's textual reports were published, which provoked suicide.
"I don't care if you both jump out of the building or get out of the building," was written in text reports that Carter only sent two weeks before his death when Roy was on family leave.
A few minutes before he was killed, she wrote to him, "You have to do this to Conrade" and "I'll just hit the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz stated that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to hold any comments in the press.
The case has raised many questions.
One of the people on Carter's side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Ms. Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison."
Audi adjusts up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to acute response
The day before the Audi car manufacturer announced that it would offer its customers an update of the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The president of BMW said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent possibilities than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is based on BMW - which consider ban or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he will adjust three million Mercedes vehicles throughout Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a download.
European car manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon emissions regulation.
However, nitrogen oxide, which releases diesel engines, is considered to be carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time there is an increase in the cost of cars on the installation of a gas neutralisation facility, which facilitates the competitiveness of cars.
While Germany’s car manufacturers are facing careful inspections, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing charges against the dissipation of powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The company is trying to avoid Volkswagen's errors, which, in order to meet the emission limits, installed software in its vehicles, which reduced the amount of emissions emitted during the test, but under normal conditions, the software was disabled.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen were accused in the United States and others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head thermodynamics of the engine development department in Audi would be arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian national and does not refer to him as extradice, so he may face a trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi engaged in a criminal investigation of the German police in the Volkswagen car after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to cover European emission limits - and extended the charge that Audi faces in the USA.
The inclusion of the Audi car in the investigation may have a bad impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer is a disproportionate share of the Volkswagen profit.
The plane landed on the beach.
The man and the girl are dead.
There was an accident at the beach Praia de São João in the area of Costa da Caparica, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the SIC News television channel said that the plane was flying straight ahead of the people who were on the beach.
Some people from the beach were supposed to flee from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people couldn't escape the machine.
On the beach, local media killed a 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl.
"The plane hit them and they were dead," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias described.
Their nationality is not known yet.
There were two people on board the plane, both of them were out of the accident alive, and the police took them to the police station for questioning.
D11 or not to build a road.
And the roads in the Czech Republic are complete?
I'll give you a fight.
It's unattainable, even though it started building in 1978.
Even though it's unstoppable, it's constantly being fixed.
And it must not continue to be built, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, the town's D11.
The construction of its next section for at least a few months has stopped the movement of the Earth's children.
We exiters get the distance by the pieces, like they're stealing the salt.
They're hiding a spoon and then they'll just see when and if we get any more.
Then we don't want anything miraculous.
We just want a short drive and we want to get a truck going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Infinite trucks run directly through the city of Jaroměř or Nachod, which is not as reasonable as an object.
But so far, the last stretch of our sleeping distance was carried out in 2008, that is, nine years ago.
Since then, not a dick.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of unfinished section to Hradci Králov and other sections to Jaromere started with an archaeological research that began at the end of this year, you could hear the loud shouts of spunts in the eastern Czech Republic.
No one's believed in it.
Last week it turned out to be no building this year.
And maybe not next year.
The movement of the Children of the Earth Club for sustainable transport from Brno has given a breakdown.
Children Earth repeat their D1 tactics.
They attacked a building permit decision all over the place.
They shall request a review of all already issued mandatory opinions of all relevant authorities.
For example, the mayor, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Drog Office.
So far, we're going from D11 to the nearby village with an excuse for the funeral.
So we're riding, we're just going along the road, and we're on the other side of the road, and we're giving priority to getting in the column.
The worst part is that you see similar stories all over the Republic.
It's a fascinating, constantly en route to Benešov, D1 or D8.
Everyone's got their funeral.
What do the Children of the Earth require?
What is the essence of the problems of the construction of communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is the existing remote network practically inexhaustible in the current system?
Read in the new reflex.
Levandule from Provence threatens climate change
Levandule has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but they are now threatened by climate change.
Levanduli lives as a result of dry climate and harmful noise, causing fear on the faces of researchers and farmers who are looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, stated: “The growing of olive trees in Provence is threatened because in the last few years, this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less precipitation in the spring and in the autumn.
It affects the life of the lavender.
They also have cicadas and rabbits carrying micro-bacterials in the dry air."
There's a lot of bets.
Levandule attracts tourists and the oil produced from them is an important ingredient of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The place of long and beautiful flowers is growing smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
The quantity of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, smaller."
A possible solution can be a more efficient distribution of water and a slowing down of water from the soil, but also a lavender of the protection mixture of salt and water and the smelting of several species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of journalists highlights growing threats in Mexico
Employees of the riodoce weekly meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the troubles that are taking place in the area of Sinaloa for the participation of organised criminals, corrupt officials and drug-free wars.
Today, however, recent events are taking place mainly because of their own safety.
They know it's important to change their habits.
Two deserving journalists are talking about what would be safer: taking their children with them to the office where someone attacked the grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
The experts wrote three simple words on the black table: opponents, neutrals and allies.
They ask reporters to name any word - there is no need for any evidence, just use imagination and imagination.
Choosing them from what - drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to hide crime.
Violence is not stopped and the body is being pushed across the country against the whole country; journalists continue to be among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, they are at least 25 from the appearance of President Enrique Pena Nieta to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven of them were killed this year in all seven states.
Among them is the associate editor of the magazine Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence, which is associated with drug trafficking.
His loss is sensational, although his presence is all-perceived - a large photo of Valdez with the inscription "Justice", on which the medium hangs in the opposite direction of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a shirt with a photo of Valdez with smile on the face, glasses on the nose and panama hats.
The meeting takes place not two months after his death; journalists talk about each other's traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010 to deal with the case of journalists, two suspects were still concerned, according to the opinion of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime.
Journalists from Riodoce insist that they inform about the violence that is taking place in Sinaloa; and although destruction is a pity and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the murderers and without a vision of justice, the meeting on security is an impenetrable one, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, we can't trust anyone."
On 15 May, Valdez left the center of Riodace in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to catch several blocks when his red Toyota Corroll was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, according to all due to the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelve River.
The shooters then stepped into his car and almost knocked her out of the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a woman and two grown children.
It seems that the news is spreading rapidly in Culiacan.
In Valdez's case, however, there is still a suspect.
Since Guzman's last arrest and his January edition into the United States, Sinaloa has been one of the country's most bloody warriors, how the rival group is trying to fill an empty place.
Every day, several people and graves are killed in the streets of Sinaloa, full of two-footed mausoleum for drug kings, many of whom are larger than houses.
Remember, the word "appropriate" means that one drug cartel controls the coastal state with precious ports and important routes that travel to the United States of America.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was familiar with the risks of his employment, with Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodace still regrets that he did not save his friend.
They believe that two doubts have contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of a conversation with Damaso Lopez, leader of one of the rival drug cartels that led the war with Joaquín Guzman's sons.
The peace could break the sons; the suspects of the gang gathered all copies of the news at the time they arrived on the counter.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the entertainment of the other news in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death was seen as an important milestone in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He was able to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed it would never change.
In the Noroest magazine, he was practically veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his stock at $50 and set up with five colleagues in Riodoce.
In Sinaloe, "it was impossible to operate a newspaper and not mention drug trafficking," Bojorquez said.
In time, Ríodoc received a good reputation for solid and truthful reporting; the news began to be given.
Newspapers were happy to go to search for issues and publish texts without censorship - the reader fascinated to read stories that nobody else dares to publish.
Eight years after the foundation was founded, Riodoce won Maria Moores Cabot's prestigious award for the Latin American report.
The same year, Valdez won the International Freedom of the Press Committee for the Protection of Journalists' Strong Report on Mexican Drug Trade.
Valdez openly admitted he was afraid.
"I was afraid of my life," he said in accepting the price.
Trade in drugs in Sinaloae is "the way of life," Valdez said in October last year in a conversation for Rompeiento TV.
“You have to take on the role of journalists - or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What did you do to the face of death... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The employees of Riodace are running out after Valdez. The man was familiar with his jokes and unchosen language. He was a good friend who loved to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone's been on his routine every day.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the office and sat at the same table.
Now they're asking: did this routine owe him his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job the best and stay alive?
"They don't like you mess with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret landing grounds."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-conception.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel like there's something wrong here, your hands are gone.
The problem is, editor Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "the meaning that can be conveyed... and then came to that thing with Javier."
According to him, the old rules, like others, are no longer applicable in Sinaloae - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to the toxic mix of luxurious pastures, weak governments and corrupt policies.
The country is constantly changing.
No mobile phones were allowed in a room where Riodoce employees met; so a few days ago, spyware was discovered that bought governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building two policemen are located at the bottom of the 40-degree road in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the office of Riodace, which is located in the four-storey building in the city district of Culiacan.
Newspapers are hiding if these politicians don't belong to them to 50 percent of the law's defenders who, according to the government's statement of corruption.
It's been a couple of months since the reporters spent the last time in the mountainous areas that essentially control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the program this week.
The first one is the murder of the former boxer Julio César Chavez in Sinaloe.
They also have a focus on suspicious government spending that went through in the home city of the governor of the state.
Recently there were also several kidnappings in one of the most luxurious Culiacan restaurants, a single block from the state representative's office.
No one officially informed the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so the reporters took note when they were going to write about what each city's population knows: that it's a restaurant that's the favorite destination of drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from the public records that the restaurant was registered on behalf of a certain policy, which is a member of the institutional revolutionary party (PRI), controlling all levels of political scene almost throughout the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption in high stations.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about the previous incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including the incident where one of the sons of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán escaped the military intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would read about this topic in the Valdez section, which was the best source of information on the kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly solve the case," said Villarreal (46), who is renamed "El Flaco" for his smooth character.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office has changed into a cedulium warehouse and a case of protests against the killing of journalists. Employees certainly did not expect them to become activists in the presence of press.
The journalist, Miriam Ramirezová, took several seats and was given a demonstration next morning in front of the state representative's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared only three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
There was only a burned body, and the authorities say that the DNA analysis is based on Adamea.
The activity of journalists is taking place all over the country. Many of them organize protests and march on the "SOS print" and constructions.
The news director of Bojorquez is the day of a visit to Washington, where he is trying to get international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, who took place the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirezová accused the authorities of monitoring journalists and their murder for declaring the truth.
In the meantime, she asked for a translation into another department of concern that her anger might threaten her integrity.
Valdez repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "encumbered" by organised crime, corrupt officials and corrupt public.
In his last book Narco-journalism, he wrote that journalists die not only by the hand of drug cartels, but also by order of policies and security forces that cooperate with organised crime.
The media surveillance group Article 19 accused more than half of all attacks on police and public officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to shut you up," Ramirez added.
The murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of the blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who arrived six years ago at the northern borders of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with a message that allegedly signed the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up for my reports."
Next to her head, she lay a keyboard and a listener.
Some branches decided to end the activity, such as the El Norte newspaper, sitting at the northern borders of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslavy Breach.
The others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after his director was killed in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the public drug cartels as an article on the opening page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some reporters fled their homes or even across the border.
It's an inconvenient decision.
Finding work in exile is difficult, as it is to get rid of the feeling that someone is constantly following you.
And reporters are persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Rubena Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in the apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who have decided to stay and not give up their jobs, there is a great risk every day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet, admits that writing drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday afternoon and Riodoce employees are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when it starts calling the phone.
It is learned that 19 people died in a gunshot between gang members and policemen near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just like many of the messages left in this area by members of the syndicate.
Newspapers publish this news from the mobile phone on the riodoce website.
He won't even run one day, and the opening title changes again.
The sounds of the police sirens point to another shot.
Fighterquez takes a flying look at police surveillance to make sure they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't give up.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their journal - whose mediator is an outstanding slogan for the whole of Sinaloe - all Riodoce employees follow his steps.
"How could we just think about leaving," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, one internist asked me to send her to the street?"
Dinosaurs used a camouflage to drive away their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a socha, no matter how scary it is.
Researchers have now discovered the conclusions of the first findings of the amazing creation of the size of the rhino, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts have called 'Mona Lisau dinosaurs' - found the Canadian mine.
The residues were kept to such a high level that the experts were able to determine the colour of red on its dirty skin and found that the dinosaur had a “problem past”.
The article in the magazine Current Biology stated that it is one of “the most remarkable ever found in the world of a reversed dinosaur and one of the best species of dinosaurs.”
The stone is a new species of Nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the period Kryda, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked researchers who described it as “in fact remarkable”.
According to the National Geographic, the armored whitesmith is still the best preserved stone of his species.
There is Shawn Funk, who discovered the stone on March 21, 2011 when he returned to Suncor Millenium, near Canada's Alberty.
He came across something that looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it closer.
The stone was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working on the discovery of animals from a huge piece of land weighing 1,100 kg.
After completion of work, the dinosaur is ready to reveal.
“It’s time to close your eyes and believe you’re asleep,” said Caleb Brown’s manager and naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
“It will certainly be recorded in history as one of the most beautiful and cherished species of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin, researchers found that this beekeeper - although he was covered with bran and reminded of a walking tank - was likely facing a serious threat from massive dinosaurs.
The heavy-armed dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to protect the predators and used a masking system that uses many animals today.
Experts say that it made it possible for him to follow his surroundings better and avoid enemies. The masking system indicates that he was the favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
News of 110 million years of old Nodosauridae was first published in the May newspaper. Currently available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers gave him the name Borealopelt markmitcheli after Mark Mitchell's museum technique, which, along with the team, spent more than 7,000 hours searching for fossils.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved fossil state, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could document the patterns and shape of the caves and skulls all over the body.
They discovered the masking method they usually use today in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is normal in nature, finding researchers is surprising because Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that dinosaurs were so many predators that evolution gave the preference to masking before confrontation.
Many modern animals with masking - such as deer, zebra, or peaches - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as a prey, indicating that nosodaurus had to fight for his survivors literally.
“The transmission of a huge and heavy reverse dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by the predators during the chrysal period,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic ingredients contained in the strains also revealed that dinosaurs were likely to have reddish hues.
Researchers continue to study animals and look for further knowledge of their life, including the preserved contents of the stomach to trace their final food.
They believe that after death the dinosaur fell into the river and was taken to the sea where he drowned at the bottom.
In the area of Alberta at that time there was the same climate as in today’s Florida and the rivers and oceans moved much further into the interior than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is really noticeable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved dirty skin and at the same time it is kept in three dimensions and we can see its original size,” Brown said.
“For these reasons, animals look practically the same as in the time of the chrysus.
You don't have to use your imagination to rebuild it; just a little bit of an eyebrows and it looks like it's just sleeping.'
During the time of the crests, there were huge thermopods, massaging dinosaurs, moving on two feet.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyronasaurus rég - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could be the favorite of the same terrible ancestors.
Among them is Acrocanthosaurus, 11.5 meters long monster with weight over 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in the magazine Current Biology, believe that the body of Borealopelt was flooded into the sea after it was mummified in the bath.
It was found by Shawn Funk, who discovered the stone at the bottom of Suncor Millenium near Canada's Alberty on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armored dinosaur, including leather and tanning, which is also complete from the jaw after the jaw.
The animal reached an average length of 5 metres and weighed up to 1300 kg.
He had two inches of sand cut out of his shoulder.
Researchers believe that this excavator has invaded the land of Canada today, until he has ended up in the river that swept him into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil residues of this species are also preserved to the extent that the coated plates around the skull still cover the residues of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote back to National Geographic, “finding such a preserved entity can be compared to winning in the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more the shock I feel.
Fossil residues of this species are also preserved to the extent that the coated plates around the skull still cover the residues of the skin.
On his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the holes on his feet.'
How did one activist find out the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shot all over the body.
On the day she arrived in New York, St. Louis's cousin sat down in the Airbnb room and made contributions to Facebook on her phone.
She went on to make a contribution to some high school student.
"The police just shot an 18-year-old young man, whose body is still lying on the street," he said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote this post to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @TheePharoh constantly retweeted her contributions to the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis posted on Twitter his contributions to the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot by a white-haired police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body, which is lying on the street without a government, from where no one even took her for four hours.
"That's crazy," she thought to herself, Ferrell.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She postponed her phone to return to him the night she watched tweets about the people who gathered at Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed that he was the father of the victim and held in his hand a gift with the title "Fergusonian Police killed my unarmed son"!
She was following live reports - one of the police stood in front of a group of protestors, holding a guide in his hand and at his second end of the beating dog.
In another video, another police officer, as she pointed out, had a gun that he was looking at and said, "I will kill you all... animals."
"It's not normal," said Ferrell.
“This is not the kind of murder that we've been accustomed to and which we can call normal.
I felt the skin of a mouse all over the body.
"I was angry and I cried."
Once she got her flight back, and the second day she left home.
After arriving at 23:00, she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes the new document "Whose Streets?" which will appear in the film on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, the strength and integrity of people living in the community who go out to the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell initiated a dialogue with his daughter, dressed in flower dress and the same flower menu, on the topic that had already been discussed many times - "about black experience".
"Do you remember how I taught you how blacks had to fight for what they believed?" recalls the conversation.
"Now we're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old and that's not right."
"It didn't matter if I didn't take her with me," Ferrell later said.
"Today's events are the perfection... that came to pass in the past.
She had to know and see it in her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she had to know the difference between different levels of black experience and what we had to do to get rid of ourselves.
Although I am able to assure her of the conditions in which she does not live on her own skin of racism, she does not differ in any way from another black child-wife.
I feel that if I were to protect her from this experience, I would only harm her."
After arriving in Ferguson, South Florida Road was the first stop to the police station, which became the main activists, who expected policemen Darren Wilson to take part in the incident.
This is where Ferrell and his daughter met a local businessman who was preparing for other food.
Together, they prepared food for the bags and helped to spread it to Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrell, a new type of activism began to be born slowly.
"My activism turned up after 9 August," said Ferrell, adding that he was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn Association at the University of Missouri-St. Louis High School and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
About a few weeks later, Ferrell met with the later co-director of the document, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Fararar wanted to "document" the ongoing events.
But Ferrello thought, "Are you working on the document or are you trying to find a story that could be used?"
Such a type of skepticism has been penetrated into the community through many people, often white people who want to make up for their pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a silent conversation: “We have heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often discouraged, and we wanted to change that.”
Folayan has already been involved with co-rapporteur Damon Davis, who is a recognized local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners for the purpose of death.
His participation in the project also involved Ferrello and with the other six locals who followed the team "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown's murder.
"No one is talking about us in this document, but that's our statement," said Davis.
"This was important to me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way."
While the purpose of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about the rescue leader, but about the community's approach," Folayanová said - it was just the most impenetrable option of participating in the filming.
The document "Whose Streets?" describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell with a smile on her face, thinking for the first time when she looked at the final version of the document.
"But I understand that, in order to do this job and the policing of blacks, I have to open up."
In addition, the Ferrell's story highlights the role of the central black woman in the wider aspect of Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of movement - who created in response to the murder of the teen Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves surprises.
"Black women in leadership positions are ultimately behind the move," said Ferrell, "because we are constantly fighting on more fronts.
Black-headed women must bear the burden of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of middle black women."
However, it is true that "this is not just an affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document for his opinions.
"It was just a driving force and a source of energy," she said.
"that it is not an accident in front lines because life in these crosshairs in the skin of black women is dangerous.
You feel that energy attack before the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the television cameras cleared their position, but the difficult race gap between the community and the police persists.
Ferrell's got two and a half years of blocking the distance in demonstrations.
A social political atmosphere in the area called home described as "unlawful."
However, it is not in its own efforts that it has been committed to since three years ago to the streets of Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains."
There was a field burning in Cologne.
There were dozens of firemen in place, helping the helicopter.
Not far from the Czech Boat in Kolinsk, between the towns of Bylana and Liblice, it burned around 15 hectares of the range from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15 , the fire extinguished the third stage of fire with four possible.
According to speakers, Ladislav Holomčík helped fire from the air to light fire and a helicopter.
At 6 p.m. fire broke out, fire caused damage to 700000 crowns.
There were dozens of professional and voluntary firemen fighting on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical accident in the motor compartment of the van.
Hasit also helped a helicopter who carried out six wells of water.
"In place of intervention, we have handed over to the owner until 8:00 tomorrow, a unit of volunteer firemen will watch him," Holomčík said today.
And Becoming Resemblance: an artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery, there are immediately several faces of different shades of skin - white, black and breakfast - hung from the ceiling on the doors. Each of them looks like the previous one.
All 30 portraits were produced by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the lipsticks and hairs that Chelsea Manning sent her.
Manning's samples were sent from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison for unauthorized publication of secret cableograms on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on 2 August, bears the name A Coming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines his experience with technology, computer and art, and Manning, a transsexual and pro-racial dissident, whose punishment reduced Obama three days before his departure from the position of President of the United States.
An algorithmical DNA analysis by Manning and using 30 portraits to illustrate how a person with this genotype would look, created Dewey-Hagborg's Brit, unless an intellectual comment on the subject of DNA - as well as many ways that DNA can be interpreted - and the unmistakable determinism of these interpretations, as well as identities.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking about being considered a woman since her youth. In 2013, she was convicted on the basis of twenty complaints, including violations of six Spanish laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photographs were kept by the prison staff. Only one black-white photo in the lower quality, on which Manning, apparently concerned, sits on the driver seat in platinum blonde paruque, which is now connected.
In 2015, a positive response to the 2012 Stranger Visions project was still received.
In the framework of this project, Dewey-Hagborg has used various forensic objects - such as non-smoking cigarettes and chewers - to create images of possible images of these people.
And she just got an e-mail from Paper Magazine at the time.
"They were having an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to fill the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of opening a new exhibition.
However, visits and photography were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea with a question if she was interested in DNA portraits.
The artist and her imprisoned muse were framed within two years by correspondence.
They even created comics called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kung, who represented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was in love and could participate in the exhibitions in person.
President Obama indeed asked for the release of Manning, which was a welcome change after several years of insurmountable imprisonment in Kansas.
It is interesting that the exhibition is taking place right at the time when Donald Trump is leading a war with people who are trying to publish government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to encourage their tweets in areas that should support.
In response to the question of this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that “all is happening for some reason”.
According to an artist on one of the gallery's walls, Manning calls his huge signature (the letter "i" is drawn from the heart) after the end of "a single group society based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - hundreds of letters C, G and A recorded by the chest.
By listing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least on the biological page, we are all.
"I hope that people will take it from this, that our genome does not depend on who we are, and that genetic data are subjective and everyone can explain them according to their own," Dewey-Hagborg said. Her work is also on Spurious Memories from 2007 on video.
"DNA will tell many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last example of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page of the above-mentioned graphic novel.
Shows Manning who's driving out the King Kong way from the United States Discipline Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as they stop you in the speech, they win," it says.
"Never be silent."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"When I think about it, it's my skin's popping."
Manning's exhibition has not been personally observed - which was predicted in the comic book - but when this happens, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room with its masks, its own genomic features, listed as a group of Protestants.
This was also for the purpose of the exhibition, including nearly 160 cm high soybeans of Maning, on which the wheat is recorded by its genetic happiness groups.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel good," Dewey-Hagborg said about the portraits.
"I wanted to point out the notion of mass movement, which takes the form of Chelsea and frees her."
Professor North-West University and employee of Oxford University for murder
In these days, the international search for Professor North-West University and Staff of Oxford University is being conducted, which are being sought for suspicion of the murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, has been launched by the police.
On Monday, a arrester was issued for the murder of the first-degree man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. Jamese Cornell-Duranleau, a court-martial record of Cook County.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died as a result of several stab wounds.
The Chicago police reported that the body of the dead was found on July 27.
The police have been informed by telephone about this fact. After arriving at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead and detectives were investigating the case as murder.
Lathem has been a professor of microbiology and immunology at the North-West University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of the University for Public Relations, in his e-mail statement, stated that Latham is now on administrative leave and has been forbidden to enter the university's school premises.
"The whole issue is now being investigated by the competent authorities and the North-West University is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at the University of Oxford.
Speaking universities and Somerville College stated in an e-mail statement: "We were contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the US police as well."
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were really shocked and wanted him to join the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, a leading contact with the Chicago Police Department, stated that he calls on suspects to give up their duties to the competent authorities.
"The police have information about their place of residence and the effort to set the suspects on fire is escalating," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and international police are helping in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events to which he was supposed to be in apartment No. 1008.
The police have described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi stated that it is unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July.
He added that Latham and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza authorities have issued a statement to all residents: "The police are now working to draw up a timely overview and profile of the victims and investigate various motives, including domestic violence."
"In the near future we will complete the WADA plan" - Vice-President of the Russian Government Mutko
The Vice-President of the Russian Government, Vitaly Mutko, stated that it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSAD).
‘At present, part of the criteria for the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to issue a code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of the validity of the RUSADA - which has recently been published on the organisation's website.
According to the Mutka Code, it does not contain anything that Russia should worry about.
"All have been notified and all will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Wada as soon as possible," he added.
One of the above criteria, however, calls for the public notification of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, on the alleged sponsorship of Russian sportsmen from the government.
On this subject, Mutko said: “We know the investigation, since our antidoping system obviously failed.
It has been adapted to all measures.
However, there were no state programmes in our country, so we cannot admit to anything that never existed."
The Mutko word confirmed Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In his interview with the Russian RSport Smirnov, he acknowledged the problems of the Russian anti-doping factors, but added: “On many occasions we have stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the message entirely without exception," Smirnov said.
WADA suspected Russia’s taking doping checks in Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation authorised planning and pooling of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
Following the visit of the Moscow Centre of the organisation in July, Director General WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "in the right way" to restore validity.
The police have accused three people. One is young.
The police accused three men of setting up a central fire of a rare wooden church in Trincium-Gutech at Frýdecko-Místecka.
One accused is young, all three are Czech nationals.
For the crime of general threat, they are threatened by 15 years in prison.
The reporters today were told by Moravian Police Director Tomáš Kužel.
He thought it was an intentional crime.
"It's a very fresh issue and the police are currently working on the whole issue," Kužel said.
He stated that the police would be dealing with possible arrests of the defendants.
No further information can be published by the Director.
"I can't tell anymore, because, in fact, workers are working on the crime police and investigation and state representatives who are watching the thing," Kužel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech dates back to the 16th century.
He was a valuable memory with many original equipment and images from the first half of the 16th century.
Major damage will go according to preliminary estimates to tens of millions of crowns, but historical loss is uncalculated.
After the fires began to be considered the refurbishment of the church.
Most of the costs should cover insurance, other costs are ready to be allocated to the Ministry of Culture and the City, a public collection is also being prepared, and it is calculated with the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. local horticulture.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrab also destroyed a fire fifteen years ago.
That's when the power plant went off.
Then there was an exact copy in his place.
The state counts with citizens in the defence of the state.
They'll support their training.
With financial support for defence-related companies, with voluntary shooting training or with the training team, the purpose of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the State is to be taken into account.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been entrusted with its task by the government, promises that it will thus be able to increase the physical capacity of the Czechs and their capabilities, which could then be used in crisis situations.
It comes from a proposal that the ministry has prepared.
If the law were to be passed in the future, the State would insist on supporting the defense of hundreds of millions of crowns.
The basic objective of the proposal is, according to its authors, to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the citizens of the Czech Republic to defend the State, beyond the performance of the defence obligation and on the basis of the will.
For example, the State would provide financial or material support to the teams of amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would enable them to increase the capacity of their members.
In return, he would receive information about people who are willing to come to the country at the time of the crisis and about their abilities or material equipment.
Accreditation instructors could also be available who would assist the sexes and other stakeholders in training or education.
It is also included in the organisation of words with war veterans or people who have maintained the Croatians.
One of the possible options is that a new authority would be created to care for the administrative and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and that their ability should be used until the state of threat has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual alignment of the early apparent borders between individual types of threats," the aim is to refer to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.
The ministerial officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting as many capabilities as possible, not just those of the military.
"The basic objective of the aim is to create a very broad framework that enables every citizen to respond adequately to the situation threatening the superiority of the state or life, health and property of persons, to protect himself, if necessary, to protect others, and not to hamper the performance of the tasks by the armed forces of the Czech Republic," the intention is stated.
The adoption of the law would bring small financial claims.
According to the Ministry, they will be subject to the chosen variant.
For example, the Office provides financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the protection of the state up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could be around 60 million crowns a year.
Other money would go to pay or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the role of the National Military Commands should be extended, which together employ another 42 soldiers.
The representatives of the Ministry have already stated that the law should also help to resolve the disagreement between certain Czech policies with the introduction of a European Union directive on arms retention.
His acceptance would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to leave some of the weapons that the directive commands.
Startups that your company will help to avoid another Uber
Amy Errettová wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees of her e-commerce startup, but did not find the corresponding investigation.
The answers were often inaccurate, ineffective, or even misleading.
And although she promised anonymous research, some employees expressed their distrust throughout the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of the hair care company Madison Reed, who has a home in San Francisco, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for external help.
New start-ups from the human resources sector are constantly on the market, helping the company with employee satisfaction surveys.
The creation and licensing of software for the purpose of measuring employees’ obligations enables companies to carry out rapid voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offers a complete anonymity of employees and a hot line for complaints, and in some cases also allows informants to meet and contact the director directly.
"There are tools like Strava and Fitbit on the market that follow your health status, but where's Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glint, based in Reedwood City.
Errett said that she had received more information in three years about what her employees thought and how they felt.
In addition to quick research and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company's thermal map and a regular overview of groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as a review of low-assessment managers - which allows users to work on repair.
The companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to look after the culture of the working environment - in case it becomes another Uber - which is going to fail in the scandals after the former employee published on his blog a contribution describing the corporate environment and burdening employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture research is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance sector can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
The start-up Converter from Denver in Colorado, which helps the company to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a slight increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Nearly 600 clients of the Converter belong to Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, under his wings, he also accepted Uber.
Like Glint, the Converter allows the company to send adaptable "blascal" searches, collect reliable information in real time and display heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report unfair behaviour.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, the complaints shall be sent directly to the Administrative Board.
"The Court of Justice has strengthened regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of the Convercent launch.
If the company is aware of the wrong conduct with its employees or non-ethical behaviour - and if the regulators do not proceed - it can face costly consequences as a result of customer boycotts, exhausting employees or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday Restaurant network, which employs more than 25,000 people over 500 locations, uses the Converter more than a year to raise employees' awareness of corporate principles and procedures and to ensure an easy way to contact corporate governance.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to look for a phone number or e-mail to run the company, officially file a complaint and hope in a reliable solution.
It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Deputy General Ruby Tuesday, that there was no reliable way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Converter, a quick detection and resolution of problems that have never occurred before to managers sitting in the offices have been distanced from the real settlement of complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"This is close to a holistic, overall view of employee experience," said Vitrano, who runs a group of Ruby Tuesday risk management companies.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from judicial disputes by employees."
The companies ceased to take the ethics, values and participation of employees on a light basis in 2002 after Arthur Andersen's accountant crashed after Enron's downfall in the abuse of employees' ethical rights, Quinlan said.
But only when “the social media was all over it”, companies began to realize that they could not simply hide their bones in the box in the online world.
"Before people started using technology ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint i Converter offers its software in the form of a service for which the company pays regular fees.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by the courageous capital investors who supported both startups.
Convercent selected in his February campaign from a company like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital a total of $10 million and finally took up the capital of $47 million.
Glint won $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and won $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are extremely surprising given the mutual nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, they are not the main advantage of high wages and interesting projects.
Employees want to note that they are accepted and valued and that they spend their time in a company that is trying to do a positive job.
"If people in their work are happy, they believe that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice-president of the global benefits and employee benefits of LinkedIn, who uses Convert and Glint.
Investors make a profit if they make a profit to companies and companies if they are satisfied with their employees.
And when there is an analytical tool on the market that ensures the commitment and commitment of employees to the company, it is not surprising that there are many investors who support this effort.
According to labour culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data themselves are insensitive if the company does not submit the necessary steps.
The fact is that once the company requests a rebound from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change doesn't happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest to the employees.
"As soon as you ask for 4,000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, the counsellor at Kotter International, who was witnesses of many companies that relied too much on their own data.
"Because as soon as you don’t finish things, the employees will start to ask, ‘Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I be interested?"
Madison Reed, who now regularly conducts a survey among employees each month, has been able to solve the problem by one day thanks to Glint, Erretová.
After the meeting, Erretová managed to reorganise several teams within the company and to start communication training to solve the problem by slow decision-making and quality.
Ruby Tuesday has a very important look at her employees and hopes that she will achieve a high level of employment in the field, which is known for her frequent leave for a long time.
"If you do not try to create a transparent working environment, employees will not believe you," Vitrano added.
"And once you start losing your employees, you'll find customers.
And with the removal of customers, the whole company's broken down."
Thursday became the warmest day.
Thursday is the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic, with 38.3 degrees recorded in the Watch Tower.
He crossed the Tuesday, which was the warmest day of the year at 37.3 degrees.
The employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute were informed of this.
On the other hand, on Thursday, there were not many thermal records.
The weather hit Moravu mainly, it was mostly cloudy in the Czech Republic.
On Tuesday they were overrun, or recorded for 35 of 145 meteorological stations over 30 years of age.
On Thursday, the record recorded only nine long measuring stations.
Today’s temperature was probably the same as the previous 2013 record.
In the Lednica in Břeclavska today, the original maximum of four tenths in degrees exceeded the record of three tenths in the current 37,1 in the Břeclavska mountains.
Both records as well as the Watchtower came from 2013.
High temperatures were present today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Watchtower, there was the largest lead in the Dyjakovii in Znojemska and Brodá nad Dij nad Břeclavska, where the mercury was duly extracted to 37,8 degrees, but the record did not surpass.
On the contrary, for example, in Western and North-West Czechs, the ČHMU website has so far been the highest temperature of only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there began to grow until now afternoon," said meteorologists.
The current weather in the Czech Republic will gradually decline according to the ČHMU, and on Sunday they could also come with more significant rain.
Most Moravia places, however, will remain high temperatures on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia and on Saturday.
We've got this mess out here.
The same voice in elections is not enough for billions of people in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not all are as bold as Andrey Babish, who wants to own a state, buys political parties.
The owner of Penty Marek is sponsoring the Royal Realists with other colleagues in the water Martin Burdo and Antonine Frycz.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of insurance and by the businessman in the realities of Pavel Sehnal, who is also the president.
The convicted corrupter and the king of the Czech gambling Ivo Valenta ordered the Privacy Party.
The political movement of Agrofert, as the Andrej Babiše project called the cross-border mayor Jaroslav Germany, is a chapter for itself.
Their billionaires have recently captured the Old Ages too.
It's Dalibor Grandpa, the owner of the company on the Jablotron security facility.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
The entrance to the old-fashioned dress, but it didn't really work out.
"I've never had little goals," said the press conference.
This means that my goal is to move the ANO to make the Old Age movement twenty percent in elections.
Leckdo's a puzzle.
But the grandfather's renunciation is more significant.
The billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of strong opinions.
While he is going to take care of the votes of the voters in the dress of the Starosts, Andrej Babiš continues to support.
Grandfather, in the past parliamentary elections, supported Babies.
"The grandmother is not an armed speaker and does not rule the favorite rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote before the 2013 elections.
But he certainly doesn't go into politics because he wants to improve himself.
For me, Babi's hero will stay.
He's willing to get out of his world that's under control and do something for us all.
Shortly after the Old Ages introduced her as a new power, he came back from his tour to Babish.
And he said he wanted the Elders to learn how to work with Babi.
Some may feel that the Pope does not change his mind and stand by his dress regardless of what he wears.
Others may wonder if Babi is sending to the elders to build his bag of someone so unstable.
Another question may be asked whether Jablotron's boss and Agrofert's boss may not have gone wrong in the shop and looked for a different way to defend his business rival.
The first Pope's public performance was not just around Babies.
Grandfather promised to send ten million crowns to the mayor's campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been difficult for anyone to stop from the same sentence.
Another well-recognised winner Zdeněk Bakal, prior to the 2010 elections, fired millions on all sides.
The political division of the security agencies of Vita Barty, TOP 09, and the citizens of the Democratic Republic have come together to make a total of thirty million.
It's just another time today.
The law prohibits any political party from giving more than three million.
When he entered politics, he could at least adjust the rules of the game.
Maybe then he doesn't have to ask himself why politics has such a bad reputation.
His first days in politics, then he crowned the proposal for tax benefits for families with studying children.
People with high school education will come to our home about fifty thousand a month.
You're based on a few 20s.
A man with fifty thousand is rich in present conditions.
The one with the twenty poor.
In the Christmas vision, poor companies are paying taxes and rich people benefit from the functioning of a social state, where they do not share their way too much.
The rich need help not to give up on their needs.
The seniors can congratulate each other on their new acquisitions, and Babies will have a lot of hands.
The rest of us, thanks to the Pope, can confirm that billions are not good people.
Then there's another question to choose.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to keep them.
Those who are neither members nor members of their own party nor citizens of the State for their employees nor the country for their property.
And in the end, those who want to live well in a prosperous land, not just some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The Will complex had to be worth 234 million.
The sale of property is sometimes not easy.
And sometimes he can't even help 11 bedrooms, a beautiful sea view, or the fact that property sells the president of the United States Donald Trump.
At the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down on incredible 8 million pounds.
He reported on this website Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Avoid the place like no other.
Even though the merger of a real company with the US President did not cover the extreme price.
Donald Trump had to lower the price of his Caribbean home with an incredible 8 million pounds.
The original real estate price was 21.5 million pounds, the final price fell to 13 million pounds.
Even after the decline, the villa complex stands at about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
The charming 5 acre settlement on the Caribbean island of St Martin has 12 full-scale bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, dining rooms and other rooms.
It's made up of several buildings.
Part of the land is also a swimming pool and tennis court.
There are dozens of fires on the ground.
The terrace is a beautiful sea view.
According to the actual experts, the fact that the connection with the president is not sufficient to attract potential buyers was shown at the price.
Now real estate is closer to the usual real estate prices on the island.
Trump bought real estate in 2013.
According to the speculation, he paid about 15 million pounds.
The real estate was to buy for rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
With a new price, it's going to be in a second place.
The property in the neighbourhood was estimated at 13.5 million pounds.
The NSAA decided to end two training sessions a day.
The eleven-morning and American football players at UCLA are playing in the side row of the new school game.
Some of them take off their clothes and reveal their welcome back, the unmistakable sign of the first day of the training camp.
For the majority of team members, these few minutes of non-working is accompanied by a noon break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to rooms after three-hour training to study final exams before returning to the Waterman Football Center for a meeting that will take place next morning at 6:30 p.m.
"For these guys, there will be a real cat for the next three days," said coach Bruins Jim Mora a moment before Monday's fall off Tuesday.
By cutting out two trains in one day, the NSAA wants to postpone players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least by Friday, when final tests are completed.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are planned at 19:15 - to get stuck in the already overcrowded diaries of many students.
At first, in six seasons, he spent Mora in the position of a coach in Westwood, starting a training camp of Bruins a week before last year and training is limited during the summer semester. He also has a decision to limit the number of coaches from two to one day.
A total of eighteen training courses are planned until 20 August, starting with formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
It must have been heard that it supported the NCAA decision, although it added another item to the player's already in the loop.
"Three or four days are players under great stress and it is very exhausting for them," said Mora.
"But no one gave it up, everyone's trying.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy in view of the clear line of surrounding lands from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which has occupied players after the installation of a protective network behind the white carpet.
The Bruins players should want to sit down this week, but Mora admits that when the rooms are empty during the season, there might be a problem.
"The land will guard the security service," Mora added.
“The safety is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training.
He's doing a good job with that stuff.
The hotel will be happy to keep a safe, as well as car park No. 8.
Let's use the maximum of our resources.
I believe everything's going to be fine.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans more thorough verification of the facts to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to control third parties and display findings under the original contributions in an effort to fight the so-called "fake news", the largest social network entered on Thursday.
The company's statement on its website states that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which will send third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the research under the original contributions.
Facebook has been designated as one of the main sources of false news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports have influenced the previous election of the President of the United States.
In Europe, political debate is on the whole. French voters are flooded with false reports about the May presidential elections and Germany is planning ahead of the September elections to impose fines on the social media network if they do not quickly remove the wrath contributions.
Facebook on Thursday, in its next statement issued in Germany, stated that it is about to start testing the new function of control of false news in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to viewing reports verified by third parties, people are asking for more content to be better informed and able to decide correctly what they can share,” stated on their blog Sara Su, a product manager of Facebook news.
She added that Facebook continues to test the "related articles" function and also works on other changes to reduce the number of false reports.
Design of graphic novels: a story about A Castle in England
The small town of Scotty Castle recently played the main role in the Squeeze music video clip and found its refuge in it also Margaret Thatcher over the last 70 and 80 years.
However, Scotty was from his cozy place at the Bewl River in the British Kent, a 700-year-old witness of stormy history, who inspired a curious Jamie Rhodez from the York County - a well-known landmark in historical documents - to create graphic novels.
"A look at the letter of a man who is 300 years after his death fascinates me," says Rhodes with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter, I feel a personal connection."
Graphical novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived in the castle of Scotty from the middle to the Edward period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first Rhodes' book of inspired archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teath and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documents of the British Library - a project that was very emotional to him.
"He handed me a fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for Jakobity," he said.
"It's his finger print!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because at those times you had to burn the candle for reading.
When I get to the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of staying in the castle almost four months as a dream. ("To tell the truth, I stayed a little longer.")
Rhodes spent time examining the Victorian “new” castle, the passage of archives and the study of many treasures and curiosites, such as the head of hyenas on the wall and the bottles that were carved after centuries in the tomb.
He walked through the land and examined the ruins of the old city, talked to the wicked, gardeners, and sometimes also with artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
In the night, he drank whiskey and wrote.
The confidential story of Scotty is relatively unknown, as the National Trust organization gained access to documents until 2006 after the death of the last generation, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the employees began to explore the archives that Rhodes described as "the aristocrats of many centuries spread their hands with the words " know it in the basement."
Diniks, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps depicting property: "You may think that the ground dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but I struck one case when two families took over the bridge.
Let the people go!"
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a reflection bridge, and they go deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, who follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English rebellion in 1381.
"I found a record of the arrest of the castle in 1380, which was in a book called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually began in this area and I thought that the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe it's somehow related to each other."
Other stories are closely linked with the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest, who hid the Darrell family seven years after the English reform.
Or The Smuggler of the 18th-century Shepherd named Arthur Darrell, who supposedly staged his own funeral when filling up the rock's shell (which was discovered several years after the discovery of the shell).
Rhodes’s favorite family are Darrellov: “I was fascinated by the male generation — the men then were always in debt and lost money for things they could not afford.
The different generations of Darrell's family have solved this by taking rich or old ladies - I imagine they were the look-out gentlemen, who had a look at their grandfather's heads."
With the completion of a stay in the castle, four Rhodes on other adventures.
He recently returned from a two - week strike in a Finnish wilderness, where he inspired his next book about Elämenmäk, which was a former sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was buried in nature.
But it's a special place for Scotty.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said, "Now let me go back to real life."
Washington changes the conditions for granting a green card
The media has published President Donald Trump's words on a new U.S. immigration plan, in which there will also be a change in the granting of a green card.
It is assumed that the number of legal immigrants will thus fall by 50 000 per year as a result of stricter rules for the granting of temporary work visas and the restriction of family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The bill will be submitted to Congress soon.
“This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars for taxpayers. We aim to amend the rules for issuing green tickets to the residents of other countries.
The law limits the number of immigrants and replaces the current scheme.
The new application process is a priority of English-speaking applicants who own funds and demonstrate the skills that will benefit our country," Trump, quoted by the media, said.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be careful
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sexual robots will appear on the Internet.
Yes.
Sexual robots are really popular at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the Sheffield University and FRR founder Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to look seriously at the rise of sexual robots.
Customers can choose the color of their eyes, the shape of their beards, and the appearance of their noses.
"People are hiding from them, but sales are growing and we must be prepared to see them as much as possible," Sharky pointed out on the occasion of publishing the report.
Modern sexual help changes from inflaming gentleman to robot women with silicone skin, which is a pleasantly warm touch - of course is artificial intelligence that resembles human behavior.
The user can "drive" the robot to his image - from the color of his eyes and the shape of the beard to the appearance and color of his nails.
It is very disturbing, however, that many robots have their own "personality", which would also insult Stepford's mistress.
Modern inflamed ladies developed into a robot woman with silicone skin.
The owner of RealBotix's robot can set up a variety of features for his replacement women, including humility.
And then there's a sex robot wife of Roxxxy Gold True Companion, which is added with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah", which is characterized by a humble nature and "wild Wendy" with a "goodness" character.
“The Roxxxy Gold Personality is set to reflect your personality as much as possible,” says True Companion.
So he likes what you like, and he likes what you like.
She's even as moody as people are.
It can be tired, loud or "in the mood".
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for a number of reasons - among which there is no substitute for real interlinkages. Concerns are more of a secondary female character rhymes and violent attacks - e.g. frigid (read annoying) Farrah.
True Companion on its websites compares Roxxxy to a man's vibrator.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't she have a man Roxxy?" she says on the page.
However, sexual robots are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their creation and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeper rooted in our culture - away from the ideal or sexual equality with the direction of the lust for subhuman sex with optional attraction.
Most men obviously do not buy a robotic woman and while FRR is talking about their growing popularity, sexual robots are still on the edge of the public interest.
However, this territorial interest can become a mirror of the current modern era.
And most people aren't strange or violent until they're closed to the free market.
It is not a coincidence that these sophisticated sexual robots appear at a time when women around the world are gaining their rights and in the White House the president, who is often very shy at the woman's address.
The worst aspect of the series The story of the ministry is not what we see - surrounded bodies and gleamed eyes, like the reality of these visions.
The book presentation The Story of the Service is a step in the right direction, but at the present time it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots should as much as possible be like real women (though with pornography).
Their creators build them so that they are pleasant to touch and act on the first look as a real woman.
However, when it comes to their "personality", the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing that would arouse their independence or violate their devotion to their master.
In other words, they're nice slaves.
21st century words: official.
NBA star on the green appetizer.
Curry's fighting in California for a shoe.
The star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose despite the packaged first fire at the premier start among professional golfers.
A double scorer for the most vulnerable NBA player played the Ellie Mae Classic lower series Web.com Tour in California Hayward first round on 74 ran and will fight for a cut.
The Golden State player who won the second title with the Warriors team in the NBA this season started very nervously and his first fire ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked by the fairway.
Even after that, he wasn't as precise as under basketball basketball basketball, but behind him, with a balance of four wounds over a couple he left a dozen professionals.
"It wasn't the perfect way to start, I had to call the judge right after the first fire, but then I sat down a little," Curry said, saying that he had a huge three.
It was very nervous to fire the first wound on the tournament, but it was all I hoped for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd read it right away," he added.
If Currym is able to fight with a shoe that is likely to be set two in pairs, he will become the first representative of another sport that can do it on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play the next better and now that I've got rid of the trees, it's probably going to go," said an enthusiastic golfer, who has already played in the tournaments of celebrities and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he's starting at the first tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he won a sponsorship and maintained an amateur status.
Web.com Tour series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Tromp's big victory?
That's what Mitt Romney's doing in a healthy way.
The unmistakable sign of Trump’s era is the political turmoil that divides American voters, and in microscales, the whole family is being broken up.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving season, it was in American newspapers to consult with relatives who love Trump.
Apparently, we're just waiting for our nerves.
However, less attention is devoted to the ability of Trump to stumble the family.
I'm talking about the fact that this week my cousin in New York visited me - a poet and a left fan who lives in Chicago and who has paid for the Republican stupidity in our family for a long time.
She reminded me that loneliness in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, there is a whole family - including all the Republican relatives with whom she has spent years in politics - on one volleyball.
At dinner at the family table, it's a good thing; but it impresses me that in a broader context it represents a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all away.
If we're talking about "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to a terrible possibility that his chessmen could one day lose their appeal.
There is, however, an even more horrendous long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the Orthodox Republics, who, contrary to its standards, will be surprised by what can be called rational.
In these days with nostalgia in my heart I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy conversation - a dog on the roof of the car, 14% of income tax (at least we had knowledge of his tax admission) - of which both examples appear in comparison with Trump as very small readings.
After Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will be at least normal, which will be an irreplaceable improvement.
We used my sister's visits and we took the kids to Central Park on the biggest roundabout that operates the New York Park Department - for your three dollars you won't find a better use if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the middle wheel is covered with glamorous - clowns and animals are filming and in fear of their own shoulders - a completely cloudy look and zinc music is a reminder of public transport.
A lot of clichés will soon come to mind: the view of the high buildings, the panoramas will watch, the place to breathe on you with the atmosphere and the reality of the city will not be given to your imaginations.
About fifty years later, I still did not realize that Swiss Cottage is not in fact Swiss cheese - it does not count the thematic home of Ye Old Swiss Cottage - but the metro station in London.
However, a colloquial in Central Park has a remarkable magical experience, to the extent that it has two two-year-olds, as well as two mature women.
Well, if I could evaluate the wheel, I'd deserve the maximum points, but no one's lucky.
This week, I experienced a similar experience in the store when I was asked to assess my "hate" on a scale from one to five on the credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street it's the same thing, except that I can make a 15 percent estimate straight for something I'm going to buy for the counter.
Not only does it slow down the fast sale, but the waiter is so forced to get into nice buyers when it's not necessary.
The woman in the store smiled at me when I was reluctant to evaluate my credit card transfer with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to the hospital due to chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius had to be transferred to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cutting wounds on the fence, which, according to the statement of the prison, caused himself to fall into a target.
The Pistorius was convicted of murder after the original sentence for murder was revoked.
He killed his girlfriend Steinkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013 several gunshot wounds through the toilet window in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have confused her with a thief.
The complainants have announced their intention of revoking the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too modest.
The National Prosecuting Authority stated that it is referring to the South African Supreme Court and that the trial will be carried out this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius is threatened with a length of punishment up to 15 years.
The South African Republic doesn't pay the death penalty.
The first time in history she gave birth to a young man in the trap of a behavioral panda who burned herself in a wild animal.
For the rescue program, the panda is a huge success.
The Centre is trying to expand the Genoffond pand held in custody.
Čang Č-chung's staff told Agent New China that he was threatening a large risk of being thrown from the relatives' crossroads.
In fact, only 471 pandas lived in the camp at the end of last year.
There are only two thousand survivors in the wild.
Trying to get the gangs involved with those savages to be the first step in protecting this species.
The Phantom Cchao-cchao was released to the natural reservation at the beginning of the panda's paring period on 11 March.
Thanks to the monitoring device on the neck, the scientists could observe every step of it.
She met her elected Cchao-cchao about 12 days later.
The sex relationship with the male was a minute and a half and it was successful.
And it can be considered a small miracle because the ponies are not considered the most successful of the animal kingdom.
The male is relatively poor at the time when the female is ready, and they are often confused and unaware of what to do.
The young woman was born healthy and, given that Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of the newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, was detained on 1 August in the early hours of the Sithonian police.
All were released on the same day, but the investigation continued.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated for bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have reinforced the rules of free campaigning and have imposed strict sanctions on anyone who is caught in a place where the campaign is not allowed.
Checks will take place all season.
The Ministry has stated that the court may bring an action.
Spilk is the first round of British Open in the 50th place.
The golfer Klara Spilk represents the first round of the British Open in the 50th place.
The stake in the Scottish Kingsbarns hung the score one hit under the pair when she played three times a burdie and twice a bogey.
A twenty-year-old Czech player has the hope that the famous majority will be the first to pass by the corner.
The entry into the competition with a $3.25 million grant went out to the best American star Michelle Wieov, who won the first round of the 64-year record, eight in pairs.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands bring millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands alone, due to the incident, has temporarily closed 180 poultry.
The Netherlands Food Safety Authority of NVWA, according to the Reuters Agency, announced that it is investigating 20 per cent of all Dutch poultry, which it considers 80 per cent of the eggs on the market to be inconvenient.
The Authority stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of egg types identified by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and poses no danger to adults, but the potential threat is for children.
The Czech SVS spoke Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also joined the closure of cattle, had not moved to the Czech Republic recently.
However, the veterinarians will take samples of hatching eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on which the problem signs of insecticide have appeared on the markets.
The eggs from Belgium were last on the Czech market in April and eggs from the Netherlands last on May.
The chicken meat from Belgium was last found in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of preparations against biles, all and clichés.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization of WHO considers preparation to be relatively toxic.
His high doses lead to feelings of weakness and rejection.
Riga is beautiful, I'm going to miss it, says the Golman Sedlæček and is looking for an engagement.
I'd still like to catch ten years.
"I'll go back there once," said 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in an evil fashion.
It's up to you to start a new year's engagement.
What were the four years you lived in Latvia?
If I were to evaluate it as a school, it would be three.
The first year I didn't catch much, I had an experienced golman in front of me.
I've learned.
The second year I started to catch.
I thought they'd give me more space before the third season.
But they brought the new golman I was fighting again.
Last year, I assumed I'd still get caught.
But during the initial ten games, we got only five points, so the coaches started to touch it.
At the end of the day, my colleague was caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it for the next season.
What was the life in Rize?
Beautiful.
It's a little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we'll get married next year.
So I brought something.
What's KHL like for the barber?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are men like us or Slovan who have to change their game style against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more back, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the playroom.
The difference is, the Russians want to play empty.
They shoot less, and even if they have a half-empty white front, they'd better record it.
There's only more shooting in Czech.
Didn't it make you trouble travelling and moving through seven time bands?
If a man doesn't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is mostly done so you need to play four games out and then you have two days off.
How do the Lotys even enter their club in KHL?
Like a national team.
The whole lotysko is watching hockey, it's a national sport with basketball.
All the fans.
Even though it didn't happen, a lot of people walked.
Did the action of Dinam in KHL help that Latvia at the world's championship this year at least went to the quarter end?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time, their results on the world's championship began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Soči, they fell in a quarter-final with Canada close to 1:2.
That was an inconvenient result for them.
Thanks to KHL they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extralige.
Roberts Bukarts settled in Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs was established before the signing of the contract.
How come there's so many of them coming here?
They're not a baseball player, they're really good.
The teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Lotty's among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL's starting in three weeks.
Why do you still have no involvement?
At the beginning of February, I knew I wouldn't continue in Russia.
We started looking for something by the fall.
She was on Sparta's desk.
But because they didn't have a budget on the golman, we didn't agree.
Then it was classic.
We've been dealing with different teams that have decided in the finals for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlina and I'll wait for something to happen.
Aren't you nervous about that?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what would happen.
The current situation is not the best, but I've been at home for a while.
I picked up something in KHL, so I'm already taking it differently.
The question only sounds when and where I sign.
How real is the variant that you're going to have a new anniversary in Zlín?
The state can do anything.
We'll see what's going to happen in a month.
Now I can just wait for what the agent's gonna do.
You prefer some competition?
The season was not so late that I could choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government is continuing to fly to Let.
In January of this year, I wrote in an article with the care of a proper economic operator about a camp in Letech near Orlík.
The basis of the problem remains the same, and I will allow the sad passage of the article to be reminded.
He's been talking about a summer camp for years.
For readers who don't know exactly what's going on, it's probably best if they look at the official cultural sites of Pietní a Letty.
There, in the introduction of a historical survey, it is learned that the camp was two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that it had served as a labor camp since 8.8.1940, that it had been a collection camp since 1st of 1942, and that it had become a civilian camp since 2.8. 1942.
The next text describes the life course in the camp, including non-Idea conditions, until March 1943, when the first summer prisoners were assigned to light transport.
On 4.5. 1943, 370 people were transported to the main transport camp.
There were 420 of them all.
A very sad story of the incalculable fates of human beings, which caused them again to be human beings and repudiated ideology.
There is no dispute that these events need to be kept in mind.
There is no dispute that this reminder should be played at a memorial in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
After socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970 ’ s it was built in the vicinity of the former camp and in the part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, a memorial opened in Letech in 1995.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to redeem and restore the spring, but it has not yet.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration is under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called for the closure of the Czech Republic in February.
So closely the facts of the camp's military verdict.
When the government approved the ransom in the autumn, it decided to draw up a scoreboard to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy out the spring.
According to Herman's Minister of Culture, "some numbers exist, but I'd probably dream of going to the public with them."
We'll see what the expert will bring in.
According to some unofficial estimates, hundreds of millions can be lost, others say the price can reach up to a billion.
So it won't be a cheap matter in any case.
And yet only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, to which the state has invested in 2010 almost ten million crowns.
Even if the whole transaction had been beautifully financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is probably not a threat, it would, I think, be the same as spending money.
Is there no other priority for the government?
A memorial, an honorable place of worship, is the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the passing tragedy, and anyone who wants can present here the memories of the suffering and murdered.
I don't see any reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and let's keep the place afloat safe.
The person responsible should, in this case, deal with the care of the proper economic operator for the property entrusted to him or her by the Government of the Czech Republic.
At least with someone like you in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Vice-President of the Government are not the whole government.
However, I also take note of from the above-mentioned facts that the UN leader's password is merely an empty pre-election proclamation.
This year, in May, I took a look directly at the place.
Very decent arrival journeys, adjusted parking spaces, replicas of wooden camp bars.
In one exhibition, in the second integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with seating options and with a view to its own piping site, which is created from stones placed in a small lock.
Lots of flowers and vines.
All attributes corresponding to the importance of this place, as they happen and belong to.
Archaeological research is currently being carried out at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would be possible, for example, for a part of the discovered bases to serve together and to access at least visually.
In this way, the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, could exert his efforts.
In the event that he is able to purchase a public money in the government, it will only be another unfortunate step in his already sufficiently problematic action as a minister of culture.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate may mitigate the symptoms of inflammation of the intestines (IBD)
For your diet, red meat and milk products can be a nightmare.
However, the new study indicates a true opposite: diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help remove the symptoms of inflammation of the intestines.
Untreated disease, which affects up to 1.3 million U.S. population and 300,000 patients in the United Kingdom, causes stomach and blood flow, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and milk products to mitigate symptoms. Researchers at Washington University found, however, that the essential amino acid triptophan contained in the protein helps to produce immune cells that support the resistance of the intestines.
Dr. Marco Colonna's study explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the recovery of harmful microbes from food.
The number of activated cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and body protection, without damaging the sensitive tissue.
As soon as the bag is bent to the side of the belt, it may lead to an ingestion of the intestines.
During the research, scientists have discovered the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerances in the stomach of the mouse with specific bacteria.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan cells - one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is usually part of the stomach microbe and the development of cells that support body tolerance.
The more triptophans had mice in their diet, the more these immune cells had."
At the same time, he proposed that if the same is shown to be true for humans, the combination of L. reuteri bacteria and triptophan-rich foods would help to develop a more susceptible and less active atmosphere.
The postgraduate researcher Dr. Luis Cervantes-Barraganwas in a study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the second group of same mice treated separately lost cells.
It has led to one group of mice having different gut microbes - a community of bacteria, viruses and lungs that usually reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse stem was tested by the method of sorting DNA and researchers found six types of bacteria in the mouse with immune cells that lost the second mouse group.
I think that they were kept in the sterile environment and that they were missing their gut microbes--they didn't develop this kind of immune cells--they were given L. Reuters bacteria--and they created immune cells.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers developed L. reuters in the fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to unexplained immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immune cells evolved into tolerance cells.
After removal of the active substance from the fluid, it was shown that it was a secondary product of triptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octaic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in a large mouse, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent. After the increase in the dose of tryptophan, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us are keeping L. Reuters bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the adjacent products of tryptophan from L. Reuters cause the development of cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in the genes associated with tryptophan have been detected in people with bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably try to develop these cells because they control the activity of the inner surface of the intestines.
A potentially high level of tryptophan in the presence of L. Reuters bacteria may increase the cell population."
José Maurinho considers the signing of a contract with Nemanja Matić and his transition to Manchester United as "genial"
Manchester United won its "genia" team in the form of Nemnja Matić - at least that's what José Mourin thought after the hostage debuted in the mid-term fight against Sampdoria.
The mother, who signed the 40 million pounds contract, entered into the first match of 2:1 in Dublin - the last pre-season match before UEFA Superpohar, where the United met on Tuesday with Real Madrid - and influenced in her role as a depositary on the side of Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matić did not have the form and played back only 45 minutes, according to the words of Mourinha, before the start of the next season of the Premier League.
"It takes time, but it is experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mind - thinking football," said Maurin.
"We'll help him get into the condition as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new associates Victor Lindelöf and Romeo Lukak also played the first match at Aviva Stadium and Maurin's slowly starting to form their eleven for the next season.
The independent source this week announced that Maurin still wants to sign a contract with the other three players, but insists that the club has carried out "fantastic work" and brought into the team three of the four most important players.
"Thanks to the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
"Four of the four would have pleased me more, but I admit that they made me the maximum."
The life challenge of the king of chicken skin Lady Hrushky.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This multi-purpose painting began to be painted thanks to a new series on the Prima Zdenów Academy TV.
The rat just blew up the chance.
"Dear Zdeňka, I would like to sign up for this in your cooking academy, because I think I can learn a lot from you," he called him in a video on the social network.
And because they've been spying on you for a few years, he hasn't forgotten the Team can't even eat him this time.
"In return, I can teach you sweating from diet chicken, American chicken or invite you to the water and show you why it's a favorite roasted cheese," Hruška said.
His participation in the new show of Pohlreich really means serious.
It's time to move up and learn from the master.
"The question is, what's the boss doing," said Bleska.
But Pohlreich did not show himself, because he filmed the new parts of his next series Yes, boss!
At the participation of Hrušky at the Culinary Academy, only Prima responded by taking the whole issue as his personal activity that goes beyond television.
In December 2004, Hruška Pohlreich founded his first cook.
It was sold over 300 thousand pieces in a few days!
The new series, presented by Prima last night at the press conference for a winter broadcast schedule, is an unfavorable cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his pupils from a number of spectators and in twelve parts he will meet with twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show now the boss cooks in November 2014 Zdeněk on the back of his trick let himself ride a cross-blade.
If he had my face there, I'd be mad.
"I only smile at that pus - pus is healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," the Lady responded.
She's thinking about Lady's cooking art.
"To do according to Lady Hrushky does not come into consideration at home, because I do not leave a gastropunk at home," he has a clear boss.
Pohlreich's tooth is very important, even according to him, I'm making chicken for honey.
In my order, but his recipes will definitely not appear," Hruška refused.
He's a bastard!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic alphabet or devil," said Pohlreich about Hruskov in one lecture.
"It's not twenty for me to be able to shake hands on them, but I can't handle them any more," Hruška pointed out to the account of the alleged insults.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and the house with a hangover
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip pointing to the body. With a simple shake of his hand, he can unlock the door from his home and office and even start a car.
Steven Northham, for the past 30 years, has allowed a small chip to be implanted between the thumb and the index, and currently offers the same service through his BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to use technology to simplify their lives.
Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the implantation and maintenance of treatment procedures.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats and the entire procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers the service of switching locks doors and cars, compatible with the microchip. The price of one lock is 300 £.
The father of one child has allowed technology to integrate into his home and car the BMW Z4 brand, which starts with a simple wave of hands.
The White House has become taxable on thousands of dollars
The White House's decision to fly with the South Lawn Navy helicopter to the occasion of the American manufacturing industry's celebration, which took place last month, came according to the shipping records issued by the TIME Week for $24,000.
The green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, in the presence of the president on board, was the top of the program from 17 July in the White House, which was a review of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence, and several senior officials of the White House have reviewed the review of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter from Connecticut was exhibited next to the boats from Maine, a fire car from Wisconsin and a spectacular lift from Mississippi.
The military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order or FRAGO and requested the presence of helicopters not more than 36 hours prior to the arrival of the helicopter on South Lawn in the "extraordinary" event, reports Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for managing the helicopter.
“I wanted to make sure that you were aware of this important event,” wrote Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to his superior, commander of the aircraft commander on the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn on 17 July at approximately 7:00 a.m. to the occasion of the inspection, the start of which is scheduled at 15:00 and will remain in place until the complete cleaning of the entire site, which was planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
The e-mail further stated that if it comes to late departures from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for return flights under the Working Time Regulation.
The original crew stayed on the scene that evening with the helicopter and with them also a security unit.
Of the records - which the TIME week was won - it was not clear whether the second crew was finally sent.
The Hatch Act prohibits public officials from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was all right," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like they're blocking you," said the deputy commander.
This review "Made in America" was marked by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But official events also have political subtitles.
In his participation in the event, the President advocated a medical reform that had passed the Senate and spoke of the effort to maintain the trust of the government regulation.
The use of aviation means such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is a serious new phenomenon.
The presidents use them when travelling.
However, their presence is unusual for presentation reasons.
Trump ordered control in February after the President's plane went in the background during his first meeting in the Melbourne campaign in Florida. His Twitter account is charged with complaints about the use of his predecessor's President's aircraft.
"The White House is pleased with the review of ‘Made in America’, which presented products from all 50 states that manufacture American materials from American materials," the representative of the press secretary Lindsay Walters said.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the area of Washington and South Lawn and practice possible occasions with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum precision.
While Trump took part in the G-20 summit in early July, HMX-1 performed 58 exercises at the White House.
The year of the review of Made and America was part of the current crew training, the state agent said.
On the same day, the helicopter unit flew within the "unpresidental support missions" for another eleven hours.
The White House stated that no further requirements had been placed on taxpayers' money.
Speaking Sikorsky stated that the company was not interested in any of the events on the exhibition of the helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for the presidential years and the exact cost of the survey is difficult to determine, according to the statement by the Navy.
According to the Ministry of Defence, an hour's price for fiscal year 2017, DoD's reimbursements for VH-3D $24,380 per year.
The records of the units indicate 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters are significantly below that amount.
"The cost of taxable persons on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenditure is very misleading," Walters said to the whole thing.
‘These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in each year’.
According to the 2015 RAND study, DoD's reimbursements do not include staff costs, but include fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
The German press secretary of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helicopters for inspection purposes.
"The idea of a review that will be held this week is to introduce products produced in the USA," Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and Connecticut state are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defence of our state, and that they provide work to hundreds if not to thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we're proud of helicopters and other military equipment, on which the production is divided by a number of American citizens.
This fact is to be noted."
It's not clear if Trump was also looking at a helicopter during his tour on South Lawn.
Back in the White House Trump addressed the representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I'm on my own right now three."
A young woman tied up in the bay at Mach Lake, the police were sailing to her.
The girl went out to the beach on Sunday about the second hour of the morning.
Instead of buying, she was trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to request a mobile phone for police help, she had the last 12 percent of her battery.
"That's why the police soon lost contact with her," said police spokesman Ivan Baláková.
At the place she described, several police guards appeared, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the policemen had to sail a hundred-metre raccoon before they felt a solid ground under their feet again," Baláková approached.
And she was likewise mistaken.
The police were oriented according to the direction from which her call for help came.
"In order not to come to at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count out loud," the speaker said.
The police found a woman in three quarters at five in the bazaars in Bornný.
She was on the edge of physical and psychological forces and showed signs of undermining.
That's why she was transferred to a hospital in Czechoslovakia by a designated nurse.
The Pope's Connection to Stan?
The bride's request becomes a sales girl.
That's a little irony.
In its web project, we are looking for a more than one billion volunteers, who basically say that the STAT suffers from a shortage of decent people.
He also stated that the political party is not a party more well-known and independent, in fact it has no national program for the election of film.
Her election candidate will only become a decent person after the conversation with the Pope, regardless of his political views.
That's how Vit Bart started, and it didn't happen very well.
In addition to his hero to decent people and personalities, who may also reward some old people, which he also admitted to Gazdík, he also undermines the popular argument of chief stan that the greatest value of movement is just political verification and experience of old age, traditionally the most popular policy and according to research.
Now, they're slowly dissipating the quickly gathered unknown personalities.
The total disparity with the people, after which the Stan changed the logo and slogan, the Gazdík also explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if the STAN of the identity had only a few suspects then, after the arrival of the Pope, only the identity game ends.
Not only did Gazdík set himself against the ANO Andrej Babiš, but on the first common press, the Pope, who publicly praised Babi, stated: "My goal is to move the ANO, then the movement of the Old Age won 20 percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't make a move.
Grandfather is a successful businessman and billionaire is certainly not an accident.
He often talks about politics like Babish, unlike him, but he doesn't build his own political brand.
STAN has for a while reminded more of reality shows than the real political side, and Dad's auxiliary hand as if she was doing more to the sales girl from the bride's request.
For some time, Stan went with TOP 09, then with people, and now he's looking for decent people to change.
Let's hope someone's coming in.
Police dogs practised in the Bridge by a helicopter
Dogs specializing in search of explosives and hunting dogs practiced today at Lake Most overflight by helicopter.
The police dog must not be cowardly and fear-flighted, said the leading police cynics of the Ústek country, Petr Tomášek.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
In Mosta they practiced the adult training of dogs, the ones who were just passing through the training.
In addition to the standard training, in which they were to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and to search for a lost figure, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that immediately, as soon as the helicopter arrives, the dog can go to work so that he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter's way.
"The old helicopter, the dog goes and is looking for it immediately," said Tomášek.
A dog who is restless or is unable to start working right away is expelled from training.
"Most of the time, then, they leave them in the garden, for example," Tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs with various specialties in the Ústek region.
They control the German sheep, but they also come from Belgian sheep.
He's got a pen on it.
"He educates himself, prepares him for the service he will do for us," Tomášek added.
The animals undergo repeated veterinary examinations that may reveal any possible medical handicrafts.
If the dog is healthy and harmless, the first test is made in 20 months.
"It's about two and a half to three years," Tomášek added.
The length of the police service depends on the dog's health condition.
Most of them serve within eight to ten years.
Then they experience most of their poems.
Trailer at the 3rd Narcos season: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the middle of the Netflix hit series
Despite the conclusion of the second Narcos season, when Pablo Escobar's killer was discovered, Netflix's series is not far away.
Confirmation by the streaming service is already expected for the third and fourth seasons - the first known is expected for the first trailer and foreclosure of other opposing positions.
In the third season, DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four affected farmers, they operate “as a company from Fortune 500,” except that they step up violent acts and attract more government actors.
Gilberto Rodriguez Oreuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Oreuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brain operation, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of connecting with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in charge of New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a verbatim American and Colombian rights defender in the fight against drugs.
Among the other players are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bisé and Arturo Castro.
The third Narcos season will take place on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections may be credible only if all members of the company, including women, have taken part in the United Nations representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, the leader of the United Nations Relief Mission, said that the election to the local representations is attended by hundreds of women, three women are in charge of the Vice-President's post and more than 30 percent of newly registered volunteers are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he stated in his mid-term statement.
Elections may be fully representative and confidential only if women are involved, as well as all related processes associated with elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban has issued a number of threats to the electoral process, which moves the international fighting activity on the other side.
In the elections this year, at first, one democratically elected government transmits its power to a very peaceful next government.
Haysom stated that a strong role for women is strengthening the democracy of Afghanistan.
The Afghan independent electoral commission has stated that a total of 3.6 million registered voters make up 1.2 million women.
The unique beer cooks beer again.
For a good beer to a rescreted beer.
The appearance and purity of the new owners returned a few years ago to the life of a brewer in Lobči near Mšena.
Bivovar, mentioned for the first time in 1586, had a renaissance core and in the 19th century was converted into a parascopy operation.
She followed the years of flowering, when the beer was pronounced mainly by dark beer.
Unfortunately, the production was stopped during World War II and a brewer was born in 1984.
Since then, the construction of a state ship has served.
The executions were carried out by the brewers after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and divided into building materials.
In 2007, however, new hopes were realized in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Paul Prouzov.
These buildings began to repair with maximum respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They devoted themselves carefully and devoted to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve original materials and building elements.
Bivovar has the same image as in the 19th century when it began its golden era.
Their work was appreciated by the brewery declaration for cultural memory by the Ministry of Culture and the building has also become part of the European industrial heritage trails.
In 2015 they also celebrated the tradition of cooking beer.
If you want to taste great lobby beer in the picturesque Kokořinska region, visit the brewery area.
In cooking beer, they use cocory water in protected rural areas, sugar from the Lobecian fields, and jade cloud.
You enjoy a traditional light bed in the outhouse, but also dark beer and specialties.
And don't miss a brewer's tour, it's on Saturday and Sunday at noon and at noon.
Cheskoslovenska's biggest diaphragm?
One of the greatest strengths of his type in the whole world?
Such a unique building should have been the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Jacler, at the top of the field grave above the village of Babi.
Originally, it was to be made up of twelve bunkers connected with extensive underground.
There should be a department, wife, ammunition, materials, electricity, machinery and hospitals.
But the construction ended the Munich Agreement.
In the next year, the only possible iron concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were destroyed.
Thanks to the fans from Spolka Stachelberg, who began to rebuild a unique building in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
The underground is already available from 75%!
The part of the area is in addition to the heating stove T-S 73 with the exhibition and underground and equipped facility of light storage, two further furnished heating stoves, storage facilities and the scientific path of Opened Trutnovsko.
The beauty, the pleasant surroundings and the pleasant views of the countryside are guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building was found on the list next to such monuments as the Great Chinese Wall, Traian's port at Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Nineveh and Nimruda.
From the beginning of the thirteenth century C.E., Kláster Chotěšov, which today is a four-wheeled building of a beautiful garden.
The list he got, but unfortunately it belongs to a unique building that threatens the soul.
But the spectators don't want to give up, and they're running a lot of actions to support the monastery.
One of them is the next anniversary of the Cochéšov monastery this Saturday of the fifth of August, where it will be attended by Vladimir Mišík, Ivan Hlas, you will see the sheer performance and look at the places of beautiful extended buildings that are usually not available.
But most of all, you enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
Do you want to look at the nerds in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to the Neanderthals in the Pavilion Anthropos of Moravian Museum in Brno, looking for an endless excursion to the deepest century of stone, to the world of our ancestors.
You will find out how non- Anderthals have been able to perfectly balance themselves with the most diverse extreme climate conditions, mainly through the establishment of ice and ice ages.
Even through their simple material culture, the teachers of their time were unsatisfied.
You will also learn how they looked like their anatomy, technological skills and hunting mind, but also their aesthetic feelings.
That you wouldn't say that to the Neanderthals?
Let him convince himself in Brno.
The fourteenth KELT & WORLD MUSIC festival is held on Saturday, Friday, in the city of Veverí.
In addition to great music you will see the construction of a Celtic village, you will try the Celtic way of life including puzzles, games for children and adults, entertainment, magic or ritual painting on the body.
There will be no lack of La Quadrilla with Irish and Scottish dances, bubonic jamming, the game of Grandpa and the amazing fire surprise at Carpe Night.
How do you like Moravskosleisco?
The seventh anniversary of the famous gastrofestival How Moravskosleisko tastes will take place on Saturday 5 August 2017 in the area of Karla Studánka mountain spa.
Cook the chef Miroslav Kalina, enjoy cooking specialities and regional food, enjoy music and dance performances, a rich program for children such as creative workshops, theatre, jumping castle, Small competition travel and, of course, a number of competitions.
Know the plant by one click.
Students with the creation of herbars and ordinary lovers of plants will help a new free Pl@ntNet application.
If they are interested in which plant they just found on the walk, this application will help them.
The only thing they'll have to do is photograph the plant and the application itself will recognize what kind of thing it is.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the Centre for Ethics and Environmental Education in the Bratislava Horsk Park under the project The City's Secret Life.
The project also included students from 50 Czech and Slovenian schools, who with teachers in the application database photographed and added plants from their environment.
The new French app is free to download on the pages The secret life of the city.
The main objective of the French programmers was to make the most of the people contribute to the application of their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognise.
"Children who hold a tablet or cell phone in their hands can go out into the woods," said the coordinator of this project Ivan Poláčová.
Based on sufficient quality photo of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application will be able to identify its name in several seconds, which will then be placed in Czech and Slovenian under the photograph.
The French have allowed us to translate the secret life of the city into Slovenian and Czech.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute to a plant image that is not yet available in the database after the account has been established.
"France will assess whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláková said.
GMB supplies regarding investment in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The committees require insurance from the manufacturers of McVitie's dryers for a long-term production commitment in the factory in Glasgow.
The Scottish Board of Directors of the GMB stated that, for the time being, the company is silent about any investment in the Tollcross factory.
More than 500 employees are working in the factory, who manufacture other products and dryers Hobnob and Rich Tea.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, stated that over the past few years, she invested more than 5 million pounds in the whole area.
She added that the staff and representatives of the committees would be "between the first informed" in the event of a change in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the construction company, the Scottish GMB Committee expressed its concern that McVitie's "will be deprived of its promises of financing and modernising production lines."
GMB Chief Organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the building manager regarding the company’s needs and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very disturbing for our members.
There have been generations of families working here, and employees come from the local community and the region of Glasgow, where work in this factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
In view of the work, wages and benefits - and despite Brexit's view, rising life costs and declining slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a prosperous manufacturer such as McVitie's."
Pladis spokesperson said: “The building manager tollcross received a letter from the GMB only yesterday and the company issued a statement as soon as possible, because we value our continuing commitment to staff and committee representatives.
The regular meeting with the staff and GMB representatives in Tollcross was held two months ago and many problems were openly discussed at this meeting.
We spoke to the employees that, as in all companies operating under extremely competitive and non-existent economic conditions, we assess our operation on a regular basis, which is applicable to all of our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested 5 million pounds in Tollcross, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the localities and, in any case, any changes in the operation of the factory, employees and representatives of the committees will be informed without delay."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about the move of Neymara three years ago?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won't be able to get Neymara on his side after it cost £189 million, so the amount needed to buy Neymara from the contract, but warned this French team of Barcelona about its record trip three years ago?
This sensational transition has developed the waters of summer transitions. Club Ligue 1 is willing to exceed more than double the previous record amount for Paul Pogby to Manchester United, who paid $89 million for it last season.
After confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the best paid professional athlete in the world - after tax will be collected from the PSG team over £500 000 a week.
Barcelona is exacerbated by the way in which Neimar got out of his contract, despite the fact that the trusted source confirmed that the club has always tried to tell Neimar everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
However, was the football world alerted to this fact three years ago by the president of the PSG?
When Manchester City in 2014 expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaif warned all clubs that would be interested in converting one of the best PSG players.
"I'm not afraid because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we'll definitely talk to one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they'll face the consequences."
It seems that Barcelona has crossed the thinking line when she expressed interest in PSG's successor, Marc Verratti.
The PSG made it clear in the sense that under no circumstances would allow the departure of an Italian representative. Thus, it is possible that Barcelona will now swallow a bitter pill for its trophies with the departure of Neymara.
Who will explain the penalty?
Does political punishment have a broad understanding of the rules?
Donald Trump was on anti-Russia sanctions.
The day before, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madura.
And the other day Trump wrote that China is not doing anything to the North Korean threat and that it is not going to go on.
And from that, it clears the idea of a penalty like a bone straw.
These things can't be thrown into one pit.
Madurova Venezuela really went on a trip to dictatorship, ba totali.
China doesn't just keep the way the U.S. president wants it.
Russia's a chapter for itself.
But if anyone wanted to do all of this in such a way that even a common will, an American, a European or a different one, understood what it is and what system of rules is based on sanctions policy, it would be almost impossible to do so.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only concerned with what President Obama has already found, which is what he has just put into effect.
So why such a mess?
Last year, Europe was afraid that if it wins the American Trump election, we would join Putin and call for sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
It's the opposite in practice.
Trump and they don't release the sanctions, but they're exacerbating.
But Europe is even more afraid.
German Prime Minister Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
It's like the basketball are just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then they are neither a basket nor an EU anti-Russia penalty.
The head of the Juncker European Commission complains again that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
It's like they're supposed to use sanctions just so weak that they don't threaten anyone?
The common taste of tape.
For three years, he heard that the sentence of anti-Russia sanctions depended only on the implementation of the mine agreement on a direct approach to Ukraine.
It is now known that it is the EU's energy security.
A love tape and a wider one.
Russia is being punished because it's getting too much up to where it doesn't have it.
China is lost because it's getting a little high.
The Venezuelan President is punished for building a dictatorship in his country's borders.
All these punishments or just considerations have their own rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the rules or the rules?
Andrej Babish: I don't consider working with Okamura.
Andrej Babish married, crosses the Republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
Apart from the Pardubic region, he's also got all the candidates ready.
According to his words, he did not specifically intervene in them.
He even agreed to lead the Moravian leader of the Heitman and shadow minister of the ANO Ivo Vondrák school.
"If he succeeds, however, he will have to choose whether he wants to be an MP or a hitman," Babish confirmed his earlier opinion.
A lot of representatives and national politicians have upset your view that the direct election of mayors and mayors should run the towns and villages themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a beneficiary of direct democracy, we choose the President directly, and I am convinced that we should also choose elders and prime ministers.
In my book, I'm not talking about the destruction of the representatives, they can be there in peace.
The question is how many of them will be.
At the presentation of your book, what I dream about, when I happen to sleep, I heard in my own ears that you were talking about cancelling the representations.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about a direct choice and a reduction in the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
The 1.2 million-person dust has 1171 representatives.
And the prime minister estimates that he's not putting up a lot of projects, but she doesn't have the power to do it.
The same applies to the government that only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which I'm not saying they did well.
The current Prime Minister is not in charge, he's just slowing down the debate.
It can't work.
Is that why you want to launch the majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's hard to do.
In the programme, we have only a change in the single option to the Senate.
We have also proposed a clever mandate for ministers and the amendment of the rules of procedure of the House, in order to prevent the unnecessary exhibition of Members who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to be held at the meetings of the Houses.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are worried about.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the record with 101 MPs, destroy the countries and the Senate, and by means of grateful care and caretakers you will control the whole country.
I'm sure it's not.
There is nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
The French President Macron announced a third-party legislative reduction, while there are 57 thousand French legislators, while there are 17 thousand Czechs.
However, Macrona does not blame anyone for threatening democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won a majority election, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
The virtues for those who have a majority are great, but only to look at Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like that in the case of the motion of the UN.
We just need a team that will work in the government for people, not for our parties or resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree that only teachers, cultural workers and social services would increase.
Why have I been voted and added 21 percent to the GIBS who are now taking 60 thousand?
Would you as a prime minister understand that?
The Prime Minister is going to be affected when ministers behave in an unfair manner, they are plunging their government with travel offices, and they would like to be a company like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and the country in Africa.
The ministers in the government don't argue, the riots are supposed to come out of it.
There must be a finished material in the cabinet, there is no room for a coalition, a strong vote and a chauffeur, there must be a decision.
How do you want to have a coherent team when the ministers act mainly on the sidelines?
There's a constitutional law over there.
When the bread was baked, Sobotka said the coalition contract was not paid, and he expelled Babies from the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if it's personality and has management skills, a similar gestas plan doesn't need.
They measure all the same and require perfect performance from all of them.
Do you know who you'd like to propose to the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it, because we're not even in that government, nobody wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I've done so terrible.
That's not the kind of creature that's in place.
The old agers, who would like to cooperate with you, may win the wing of the well-golden Jiří Chunk.
I don't think so.
ČSSD leads Lubomír Zaorálek, which does not exclude the U.N. Coalition, it may occur in the ODS Václav Klaus ml, which will not object.
I'd leave it on the electorate.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said you have a lot of common points with SPD Tommy Okamura, for example in the area of the economy.
So the occupiers come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he was running as a VV White Bart, then he was getting money for his company from the Uzwift, he was on a course there.
Of course, he's a remarkable person.
Of course, she's kind of inflamed.
When I take his program, there is a broad involvement of people in the management of society, directly democracy, that can be agreed upon.
I'm not asking you at all.
I wonder if you are the acceptable person who has xenophobic opinions, talks on demonstrations with drums and wants to get out of the EU?
We don't consider working with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine.
It's obvious he went to politics to benefit from it.
And what about the silent support of the communists of your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but I'm going to have a decision-makers.
It's about negotiating a victory with another in line, but God knows who will be the winner and who's the twin.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on a coalition government programme.
Let's get back to your efforts to be a firm.
But the government just has to drive, Prime Minister Sobotka has let everything go, never decided.
Coal affairs such as ČEB or EGAP did not work.
For Sobotka is his piece of shit, and I think that's also why he fired me.
As soon as he did so, the Czech government ruled.
It is incredible, however, that the Prime Minister has brought a resolution written by the management of the ČEZ, which holds to the Minister of Finance how to vote on the ČEZ Assembly.
If you become a prime minister, will you change your personal circumstances in the Supervisory Board and exchange top management ČEZ?
Jesus, if I'm a prime minister, he'll see you.
I'm not him yet.
It's funny that the CEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with the ČSSD would like to exchange for even better with the UN.
Well, after the election, it'll all go on again.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have any humble lobbyist or pink, I'm a single unit, and I don't even handle this.
Then answer directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you try to exchange the management of CEZ, Czech TV or the General Health Insurance, that is the institutions you criticise?
I'd like CEZ to be a transparent company.
He's been doing what he's been trying to do for years, and I've been providing for the traditional political parties.
Just looking into Mr. Schwarzenberg's sentences.
Although he had a state in the Czech Republic, he had never driven it, he was only there to count what was wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, evaluate them, set them up in a subsidiary company, arrange funding, make an additional competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her orders against me lead a permanent target campaign, but I don't have and I won't have any power to turn anyone out.
But you can handle it.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens are paying for public advertising and television fees about 7.2 billion a year, but they don't really know how these institutions own.
How come they don't know?
However, it approves the report on their economy, which has a direct impact on the position of Directors-General of the CZ and the Czech Republic.
Look how those reports are being discussed, on the super powerful Sobotka Kalausek package, which has always worked.
It pays both for the current parliamentary commission to escape from the investigation records, and for lex Babish.
And Saturday was so stupid that he let Kaluska push me out of the government, which saved a percentage of TOP 09, but the ČSSD was dressed.
They're afraid of breaking their corrupt system, and so they're talking about threatening Babish democracy.
Nobody's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the First Vice-President of the UN Jaroslav Faltýnek builds a powerland by leading his son to the Supervisory Board of Teplaren Brno and establishing a contract with the city and state companies, such as the Prague Transport Company or the Czech Roads, with its associate lawyer, Květoslav Hlin?
We have a permanent dispute in it.
I don't like it, and I've counted it several times.
The Faltínek argues that the said lawyer works at a significantly lower rate and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As a finance minister, I didn't have anyone.
We, unlike the devils, have never had a corrupt affair, no Pelt, a short time, a Brzezin.
If there was any sign of clientelesism with us, we just fired that person.
I'm not compromised in this direction.
If something like that happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
