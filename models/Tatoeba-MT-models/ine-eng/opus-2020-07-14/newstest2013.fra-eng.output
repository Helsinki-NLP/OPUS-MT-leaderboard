A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justify their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers it a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by fraud.
In addition, Republican lawyers have identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have been promulgating new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon took place largely after the November 2010 elections, which will add 675 new Republican representatives to 26 States.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 States were introduced during the only year 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity card with a photo and an American citizenship proof.
Moreover, these laws also reduce voting periods by advance, invalidate the right to register as elector on the day of the vote and withdraw citizens who have a judicial record of their voting rights.
Before the 2006 elections, no American State required voters to present an identity card with a photo.
India was the first State to impose such a requirement.
In 2008, the United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The Republican authorities were forced to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they have been sponsoring bill projects in 34 States to force voters to present an identity card with a photo.
It is important to note that, contrary to Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, 21 million of whom are old enough to vote, do not have identity cards with photos issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of the Afro-Americans, 15% of those who earn less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the identity card required with the photo.
Well, that's good.
Students, voters considered to be voting more for democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their identity card with photos issued by their institution in several States.
On the other hand, these same States allow members of the fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote on the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, dozens of States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly aim to limit the Spanish vote.
It is clear, however, that two Spanish voters on three are favouring the democratic party.
In addition, the Republican legislators sponsored in 2011 legislation abolishing the registration of voters on the day of the vote in eight States.
In addition, they limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to the electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, electoral registration campaigns have contributed to the registration of some 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17 per cent in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other States to reduce the voting period by advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were Afro-Americans, while only 13% of the State electors.
He was going the same way with the Spanish.
These represented only 11% of the electors, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, whites representing 76% of voters represented only 46% of voters voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several Bills have been blocked by the veto of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requesting the submission of a photo identification card.
However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make the exercise of voting rights more difficult in 2012.
The democratic criticisms denounce the partial nature of the laws that have been voted on and clearly aim to influence the results in 2012 in key States.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Centre shows that States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system will have significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prosthetic cancer detection: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present wrong results, with false negative or false positive results, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes more men who are already reluctant to pass test tests even more reluctant.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was much contamination among the Witness groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to have firm recommendations.
Another European study concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had a test and those who did not.
This study also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% more chances of metastases are available if not discarded.
So I recommend the test as of 50 years old, or as of 40 years old if we have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others who are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of cancer by offering him the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and by opting, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, a lot of people in people who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be advised to perform active surveillance and if the disease progresses, they will be given treatment.
Moreover, the criteria for deciding which should or should not be treated are specified with precision.
I therefore recommend that you pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether we should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the value and the value of the APS test.

Preventing the Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one was smoking anymore, this rate would increase to at least 50%," notes André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is linked to 85% of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This is a great night for people's health.
"Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments the spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after smoking, the risk of dying from a fall of half.
Weight
Embonding and obesity also promote the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," we add.
Food
The Agency also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of getting a colorectal cancer.
Carcuteries too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of the meat by smoking, drying or slag may result in the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," we explained.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive for the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one observed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established anymore.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and his family background with his doctor.
"Expecting a test doesn't give cancer."
The Higgs Boon Decorated
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boon created a whole emotion, last summer, and cause.
It is indeed believed that this bond is involved in the responsible mechanism of the mass of everything in the universe, nothing more than that.
And then, it's the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it's still not quite sure that it's about Higgs.
We know without a doubt that we keep an authentic new particle, and that it looks a lot like the Higgs bonbon predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a large physical conference in Kyoto appear to confirm it, but there is still no data available to be perfectly certain.
Let's assume that it's all about Higgs, because the chances of cheating look like lies, and let's see what it's all about.
In this low world, there is a fatally irreversible law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're gonna hurt yourself.
But even though particle physics is a very strange world, it appears that it also has a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantic state" - this "state" consisting in a large way in some of their characteristics.
From there, the physicists classify the particles in two categories.
In one corner, there are well - appointed citizens who wisely obey the principle of Paul.
And in the other, the beans, a bunch of anarchists who don't have respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can be beautiful and well located at the same place at the same time.
These buds then split into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by others) The Part Adventure, Berkeley Laboratoires: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs bud would be in some sort of appearance.
These bees, we need to highlight them here, not all are as exotic as we could believe them.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it's thanks to a bonbon of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "message" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an accelerated electrical charge or a change of direction, it "distorts" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a little like a hole thrown into a pond.
Of this "disruption" is born an electromagnetic wave (of light, or of infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the "power bearers" bowls.
Champ plus stable
It goes the same way with the Higgs bog, in this difference that it is another field, the Higgs' field, which must be "disturbed" to make this bog appear.
But this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it has to be reached with very, very high energy, a bit like it was a frozen pond, which only a very large rock could lift the surface.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator like CERN's - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km circuit ring! - to achieve such energy.
Analog with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
These are not all particles, nor all the materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like lovers, do it, but others don't -- a piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, it's not all the particles that interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (like the photon, tend) don't.
Now, what is "may bring" all these research, Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, it is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to look at any difference between the observations and predictions of the MS.
They are, moreover, several people who would like to be there, because the least difference could open a door on a "physical novel" and shut some holes in the Model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, with no explanation for the gravity (Oops!) or the dark matter, which is about 80% of the universe's material (Oops!).
But we haven't found any such differences in CERN so far.
Effects
The consequences of these research in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. All-the-World, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such thing.
Keep in mind: At the beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers in Bell Laboratories had no doubt about the revolution their work was going to start.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pressed) in 1962 - was seen at the beginning as a "labo gadget".
I guess...
And then, applications can also come from any instrument surrounding the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optical work.
This sensor, although it was not entirely his original intention, now serves as "eye" for all the world's digital photo devices, and it was valued by the 2009 Physical Nobel Prize.
This does not mean, of course, that LHC activities will necessarily transform our lives, but that means that, really, we never know...
Palliative Care - The Best Way to Die... ◆ The Devoir
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed as a draft law is being prepared.
However, in this crucial area, a lot remains to be done.
The Dedor tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his Monterégie apartment.
The cancer of the prostate who had been bothering her had left her a two-year rep.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," he said, mi-figue mid-rein, lying in his bed at Victor-Gadbois's palliative care house, where he came to watch.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he said.
The disease does its work: an enormous weakness that prevents it from going alone to the toilets, and even eating alone.
Attracted in front of an appetizer breakfast, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, renouncing.
Courage, he even comes to smile, speaks to the strangers who deal with him, bring him his medications, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that I am cured of diarrhea, it is humiliating," he confides.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"In our life, one learns that a man, he's standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Returning to the stage of the child, for some people, is unacceptable humiliation.
" It depends on the ability of the person " to accept the regression, he says.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the "medicines and nurses team that surround them no longer provide so-called " curative " care.
For Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die " conscious and exhausted " .
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I no longer have any desire in life," she said, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She still awaits, in the coming days, a final visit from her son from Italy.
Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, care for the body and food aid.
These are palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
By dying, we will accept to provide oral care to the brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetes will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of the day.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, dead during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the dead.
"We help people as close as patients," says Nathalie Savard, Care Director.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but don't look like them.
On the side of a 93-year-old man who celebrates his last family assembly in the court, very warm in his ears as we drink in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancers under 45 years of age," worried Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to Victor-Gadbois' house come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, care designed to relieve suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Société de Palliative Care at Home of the Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to the cancers.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec's health care that scares several doctors specialized in palliative care the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifest, signed summits of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to witness their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not good enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before it is accepted to conduct euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients don't ask to die just because they don't get adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists rely on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Helena Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she left a trialsome chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I stopped beating, she told you.
Yet she told me that I was done!
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who claim to die thank the caregivers for not accessing their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, patients would be refractory to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which return to sleep of the patient until his death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can no longer seem to hear that part of suffering.
In addition, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanase me," that means "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible through a journalism scholarship from the Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fund collectors and experts from the Italian mafia have a daily record of what they know of a formidable "system", combining building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafios.
A " industry " that cost very much to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has been getting rid of since we took the great resources," irony Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former Montréal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation into the abuses related to road work contracts in Quebec, where the prime liberal minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only agreed to return.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, hidden financing of parties and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the survey in 2010, it is emphasized that the only transport department would have spared a billion dollars on contracts," some reinventing their instincts to reach a quota party!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already fallen two mayors", he adds, hoping that it can "demonstrate the strategies behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also involved with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More police officers at the "Marteau Skuade" that, since 2009, would have led the "cartel des huouts" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the contract fluctuations...
In recent weeks, she has been conducting serious searches and charged with fraud and corruption against municipal electors, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city of banelieu.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that it has been impounded by repetitive grapevines in exchange for public contracts.
They are formally accused of engineers on the way to Montreal and Italian-born entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurs and Lino Zabbito.
The latter made sense by explaining to the Committee the mechanism of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal during the years to an intermediary related to the mafia that returned the money to the Montréal Union, the part of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito had sown all winds in the 2000s, giving more than $88,000 to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then to power.
He also knew that he had organized a collection of illegal funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Cost-of-expenditure contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked round.
Gilles Surprising, former public engineer, detailed it in front of the committee: in ten years, he received gift building companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pot-vin totaling $736 000, in exchange for offshore contracts with costs.
Other road officials have admitted that they have been able to grow the potato by swelling from 30% to 40% of the invoices, by extra error.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately shutting his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his cash boxes.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early in November, slapping Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected to take out the alarm bell.
Mayor of the River-des-Prairies district, east of the island, it rose from 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and resold... 1.6 million to promoters, full of real estate boom.
70% of the money goes out in electoral campaigns
From the investigation that will be finally put in place, it says that it "put on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by the forums, to stop gangrene and to avoid the flaws".
The process, she said, is "suffering but positive".
We are cleaning up the plague, but we would need a clean investigation unit in Montreal and a guard, so that we don't get back to the questionable practices.
Like we do the household.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elects in the course of the strategy", when they did not tremble in the warehouse!
Estimating the 70% share of money in the funding of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically said: "We told me that it was only a straw reflects the reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to $100 to the parties, but this will not change the gift, according to it: "Unless election expenses are strictly limited, there will be money available in politics."
He proposed a comprehensive revision of the public contract and party financing system: "We cannot go any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow the house to be rebuilt on more solid grounds, with more controls and laws."
If this story touches the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look at it in their own court...
"The PSG is not the Barcelona FC!"
This season, you've taken a new enigma with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Every day, I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements move me to raise my level of play.
And, in a match, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in the foot.
But I'm not inflamed.
From my beginnings at Clairefontaine's pre-forming center at my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress by bats.
So you benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that each training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Also, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
He was beaten by associates like Claude Makelele, who played at the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, it is not equal in League 1 and is part of the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and won many titles with jumping clubs.
He's got big players on the coast.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
I was out of a series of injuries then.
The confidence he has in me also explains my performance.
What are you looking at on the first part of the PSG season?
In League 1, Lyon took our lead.
But we're stuck in search.
One of our major goals is the League of Champions: we are qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now, everything can happen.
But we will have our word against very good European teams.
We first want to finish the first of our chicken, in front of Porto, to be able to receive on the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a major European short-term club?
He's already got the budget...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and join in the long term.
Today, that's not the case.
Financially, the PSG provides the means for this project to be implemented.
In League 1, not winning the title, like last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really have the heart to push this champion.
Last season, we haven't gone far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We've had a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we are supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's good.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to carry it.
Do you expect the media to wait too long for the PSG?
It's normal to expect a lot of us because of what's been invested and players that we have.
It's totally accepted.
Then, when we get 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame, of course it's a little frustrating.
We're wondering what people are waiting for more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built with time.
The League of Champions has been proved to be capable of responding.
Look at Manchester City that hasn't been able, since two seasons, to qualify for the 8th final, they have also made enormous expenditures!
In view of the amounts invested, you were pictured with 15 points of advance to the tree!
It was neglecting our opponents and France's championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, were "boasted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is passionate.
I hope that in May we will be able to have the smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up carrying it.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the operations of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
As much as we say there's a Zlatan dependency.
This means that Ibrahimic is very effective and that he has a lot of goals.
He came for that and he proves he's the League Star 1.
He demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This moves others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the team of France?
Like a disappointment.
I had a heart to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my wound prevented me from messing with the time of the game.
I've seen things down there and I've been strengthened.
Today, I can make good matches in the selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
The lessons were learned from what happened in Ukraine and today we must have exemplary behavior.
What look are you looking at in the first months of Didier Deshamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the Qualifying Group for the World.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the euro.
I hope Didier Deshamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good zero (1-1) raised in Spain on 16 October a foundation match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I've never had a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Unlike current currency exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and handling costs between stakeholders.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (more convertible to dollars, euro...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of pairs of files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a $30 (€23) summit in June 2011, fell to $2,5 months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes itself from other types of virtual currency such as "credit", used to advance in a video game you win by playing or you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social Facebook network has also developed this kind of system.
But every time, a central authority controls and treats trade.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are both account book depositors, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchangeable bitcoins exist well in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and the winner, as a temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file-sharing phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "hatch" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular print (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other nodes easily verify that it is good.
The transaction is then indestructiblely linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the print.
If, for fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because the two have different prints.
The computer that has solved the challenge has 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
So the number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the hundred millionth, leaving the margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also seen in each increase in calculation power.
The life of the network has already been high and low.
Websites providing bitcoin services have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The error used does not apply to the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also provides information on cash-laundering opportunities through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this defect.
Weight actors such as Wikipedia refuse gifts of this kind.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, giant solids were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a teaching book on this currency, believes much about the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus less expensive.
The carrier manages more and more his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in the markets, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that there are thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to be imposed, but 2013 could be a turnout," he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, also intends to reassess the various risks, which are now considered to be high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We're parties to Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
At the end of 2014, Otan and the Americans were expected to follow.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for us.
These are, in particular, the Afghan peasants whom we punished as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and wounded, mutilated.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former heads of refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign military presence, such as the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be when the West becomes more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the planted hills of almonds through French credits, took place in order.
The convoys of trucks and blinds joined Kabul without being attacked, overflighted by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban disparity on Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their unsustainable progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood because of the fights between different factions.
Their control of the country had then been seen as a kind of release, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of the obscurism of these peasants beyond the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Moudjahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in wanting to keep women in a lower position.
The most remarkable of the anti-Soviet war came to power in 2001.
They moved into businessmen, occupying government lands to re-sell them in lands to build refugees who came from Iran and Pakistan, receiving "abundant US subcontracts".
They were divided; most of them did not fight for themselves.
People, as I have heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have already benefited from American broadband will do: the flow of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They co-ordinated the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated the benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls like boys.
Work will have to be provided to these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurity of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, are friends of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish leaflets, which present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will command it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about the reconstruction of provincial militias, which will escape from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains and strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized, strong presidential state, eliminating the position of Prime Minister since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, particularly at the elections scheduled in April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s.
No industry has been returned on the road, no dams are in condition, no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was spread that Afghanistan had huge mining wealth.
This has only added to the feeling that the Westerns were only here to get away with it.
Without energy to treat on-site iron or copper mining, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to explore the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
It will also be a good day for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend largely on imports and exports, to restore normal reports.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new Treaty of Cooperation provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' lycée, boys' lycée, department of French at university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "get the hearts and minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of bringing together aid and offensive actions, a "civil-military action" service of the Ministry of Defence (Chimic), deleted in 2012, led, and led to the well-being of a small French NGO, many collective work and agricultural rehabilitation activities in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, gourmans in local work, was able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased crop areas.
What will we remember after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, very hard in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free themselves from the insurrection of foreign groups, what farmers have told me to do, it would be necessary to maintain, in their favor, a small, well-controlled civil aid that directly affects them.
A Constitution for the Force in Egypt
It's a new poker match by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives it full powers, it has decided to play its entire business.
He announced, on Wednesday, that the constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just one week ago, the Head of State had granted this Assembly two months to complete his work.
It was almost two years ago that Egypt relied on a provisional text, several times amended what weakened institutional stability and led to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased fractures in the country.
For its opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "receive his word" and to "peet the law".
On the part of its participants, it is assured that it is a means to end it as quickly as possible with the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be organised within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to abandon their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of finding popular and democratic legitimacy while the challenge is ugly throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Although this use of a precipitated vote is held by the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "You may vote for my text, or I shall keep the full powers," they are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange environment that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, a large Islamic majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing from the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had shut the door, estimateing that they had not been able to express their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
To achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added to the rush yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
No surprise, it is most often the unanimous vote that the articles have been voted on.
Commentaries have also been amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day is expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee estimate that the pendulum of the constitution was misregulated.
The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Subjects of all attention, Article 2 is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulates that "the principles of charia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, could hope to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed a more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is an indication of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," they say to the Liberals, who only see a moment of communication.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
These include article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular in verifying compliance with the laws with the Sharia.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Pommier, it's disturbing because "the people who called themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
There you can see the predictions of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are further confirmed by the fact that the next director of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not oulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" Temper Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes "that there may be an ambiguity around section 220, because the terms used lend to the religious vocabulary.
It refers to "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, etc.].
And the question could in the future be asked how much civil judges are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticised for the extensive powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
There will be no ban on the trial of civilians in military courts, as human rights associations called for.
The latter also share their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticide.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now banned, which may have serious consequences on freedom of expression, including the press.
Moreover, no article is more appropriate for the protection of women, notes Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to speak on television last night, events were scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the head of state will defil them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the World Centre and a sea of entertainment await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the size of Bible truths, modern comfort, and a wild nature.
Argumenty i Facty has held five major reasons to make you in Israel.
Go to worship the holy places
Be steadfast: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who penetrates these "baptismal funds" will be touched by God’s Grace.
As for Galilee, she is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he smelled the storm, or where the fish was miraculous.
It is in this precise place that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is well in Jerusalem.
The believers traveled to the Rue de la Suffrance or the road of Croix (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretoria), where the trial took place, then led through the streets of the old city to the Church of Saint-Sepulcre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the one of the Pierre de l'Oction and to the tomb.
Here is the Christian center of the world, a symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to Christian legend, the Monastery of the Cross is erected where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which is the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave them with little words accompanied by prayers that are then exaggerated.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of Massada fortress, former refuge against the enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only climbers can turn to it by their own means.
For others, a telephone takes them to this top full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 metres of altitude, there is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can drive you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski trails are 45 km long.
The old beliefs want pagan gods to have inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country has nearly 300 museums.
They can't all be visited during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that really matter.
First of all: the Israeli Museum located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It covers the ancient Manuscripts of Qumran, or Dead Sea Manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: the Museum of Art of Tel-Aviv.
There are mainly the paintings of the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha is waiting for you with its Turkish baths composed of mollusions of visitors and watchmen of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or memory stores.
The entrance is free and gifts are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel-Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the memory of children, built in memory of 1.5 million children who have been killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Stinting stars.
You then hear the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
The three major beach stations in Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air temperature may reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year.
In this regard, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, or 417 m below sea level.
The blue water contains samurai and very easily retains the bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are a surrealist beauty.
There is a need to treat salt water, lemon, curative sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also for everything simply relax.
Discover the Secrets of Antiquities
They are kept by the old town of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris, which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in narrow streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, the fate will smile on you.
In Jaffa, you will be able to cross a few young married people who have come to take photos of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, King Herod's city, you will be able to march into the Roman theatre, "conquering " the fortress of the crusades.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesar was the capital of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you leave for Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollar to the euro, because they are easily interchangeable in shekels (today $1 equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the low and high parts of the city.
It's almost a underground funnel.
The journey in all types of transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop their activities.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only cashier food, which excludes pigs, sea fruit, fish without scales and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
There is a wide range of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk, but also on humous, traditional Jewish pasta, various sauces, soft pepper balls, beans, fruit and vegetables.
There are no wrong dogs in the streets of the Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well - fed cats that promote high air.
They can be seen sleeping on the roofs of the parked cars in the evening.
These felins love the passing places and don't refuse to regulate them.
Car rental varies from $37 per 24h (Hyundai Gettz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Rent a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entry to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists arrived in the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the visas were cancelled on February 9, 2011.
"What language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists debate what the law on compulsory language testing will do, counterfeiters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are Central Asian nationals: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their goal is to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has come into force and states that each migrant worker will have to undergo a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, services to individuals and retail sales.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language will have to be validated, but also knowledge of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
He will need to validate his Russian language knowledge to obtain and renew his work permit.
Only Russian nationals are exempt from official language status.
Persons who have obtained certificates or diplomas prior to the fall of the USSR in 1991 are no longer covered by this Act.
Benefits, negative attitudes and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Puchkine, the University of Peoples' Friendship, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass examinations in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the members of the Duma de State and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law enters into force, human rights defenders have asked the question many times in the press: what will that give?
What is the obligation to know Russia will change for the Russians and immigrants?
First of all, they respond to the representatives of the migrant service, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery to work".
Many speak of the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
There are problems for migrants without professional training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebellev's certificate, the future migrant is intended to cross the poor people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded house where he and his ten similars will be tormented for months without food and without paper and will be sent between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised a thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they are taken by their passport, and they do not touch the expected salary," confirms the Head of Migration Services Branch for the work of the Tajikistan Migration Service, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, Mr. Policeman!
However, many of the Republics of Central Asia who want to come to earn money in Russia trust that they not only know the language of the country where they want to go but also find it difficult to write in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: little Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tadjiks can afford to follow only a passable primary education.
In fact, their families don't even have anything to feed their children without talking about how to dress them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they get to adolescence, these young people start to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, trust them.
"You're feeling reduced and slowed down."
The human rights defenders, however, note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will only be for migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal examination or work as a result.
However, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or defend your entry"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and still these language difficulties.
In addition, the cost of legalization of money: between 12 and 16 miles of rubles.
And then we can get a false recording fast for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we don't have registration, where the cases of extortion are.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy from cigarettes, tea," told reporters Oumed Khouchkadamov, who is from Tajikistan.
"Be quick, don't miss and buy a beautiful art work"
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that migrants' registration papers were not the only ones to be wrong.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by the employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The fake paper comes out of a regular color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have anything to do with them: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of examinations had to disburse seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is twice as much as the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The representatives of power and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system from corruption so that it is not possible to simply buy these "paper stickers".
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first-time examination to follow language courses.
Moreover, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian arms carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: it is the shootings carried out during the weddings or the killings organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who committed seven deaths.
The police want to ban the port of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the permit of the port of arms by making it 18 to 21 years old.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced to the Duma State soon.
Everyone is not satisfied to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "closed the visa".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demanded to abandon "this insanity."
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said the Russian service Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 crimes were committed in a six-month period in 2012, with a firearm registered in police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of the laws on civil weapons will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market .
According to them, any weapon for a reasonable price can be found in Moscow today.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims that it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the factory to the officer
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are in five, reports Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who has served for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Quarter.
Screenshot from a site taking weapons commands
The first is "the military track", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," explains Baranets.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those seized by criminals in the order forces.
Baranets explains that both weapons were stolen from police stockpiles and those seized directly to the representatives of the forces of the order.
Illicit pistols have been on sale since military warehouses.
Many of these people have often suffered explosions.
"Verified versions indicate that some fires have been fired to dissipate the deficit," the former military explains.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private weapons factories that do not compete with competition on the international market and that they embodies weapons on the black market, particularly in Moscow," one expert said.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
An important part of guns and guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes crafts, a mafia has formed and organized the supply," adds the former military.
Where are the guns coming from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Problem Analysis and Study Centre for Public Administration.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain the researchers, come from the army and the forces of the order.
Half of the weapons present on the black market have been found "on the basis of employees whose work is related to weapons", the report explains.
According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "Clandin leaves".
A salesman and consultant of a armory who has requested to keep the anonymity ensures that for a long time no one buys the weapons found by these clandestine research specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will search for new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys by means of a teaching unit, such as a TT gun.
We're giving her a ride through a grill.
"He transports it in the city and sells it for €900 per unit with two chargers," he relates.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so, when crimes are about to be eliminated, it conducts a purchase of control with illegal arms goods," the seller adds.
"As in a luxury store "
The seller and the buyer are generally based on knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy shows up and proposes to come to the Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "coin" to walk.
The price of the gun, it was given to me.
Victor Baranets and Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there must also come there by saying, for example, "On the part of such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I've even bought a pair of American bets with the help of a person I trust.
He only gives me 'cause he knows I won't give it to him.
Small new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former Military Victor Baranets tried as an illegal arms dealer in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schedules, according to him, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I believed in a luxury store," remembers the military.
There is no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try anything.
As a potential customer, I'm not happy to buy, go with the forest vendor and install a target.
"We let me shoot and when I'm convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating," the expert described.
A store from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, there is no need for any document and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a exact sum of money," we write in a newspaper on the site "Buy a gun or a combat machine."
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to the minors?
"Unpermitted, of course", the user asks "Ivan" (orthograph preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated a huge network of false sites and collects people who want to buy weapons of war.
People sit on food like hungry wolves and then they get to exploit coal in Siberia

I heard about this type of scheme: usually, the site is registered outside the scope of the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on automatic barrels.
"He receives back a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the Association "Right to a gun", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by making a request on the site, you can meet without weapons and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated a huge network of false sites and collects people who want to buy weapons of war.
"People sit on food like hungry wolves and then they re-exploit the coal in Siberia," he says.
A Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, estimated by experts, can cost between $100 and 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Association "Right to a gun", you can buy a Makarov pistol for $100-300.
We have to wait about a month and a half.
It came out of long warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the Department's official data, compared to January-October 2011, the number of these crimes has decreased by 7 per cent in Russia and rose to 22.9 miles, while the reported cases of arms, ammunition, explosives and bombs have dropped by 7.8 per cent.
United States: fast-food and supermarket employees are on strike
Nearly a quarter of U.S. teenagers go through cashier work at McDonald's
In the last few days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages practiced by the Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast restoration chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time being, no one can predict whether this wave is going to take over or get out of the way fast.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
At the same time as the modest wage increases that the basic wage earners at Walmart and in the fast restoration chains, the event organizers want to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The demonstrations began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Monday Black", when a disparagement of money from millions of people fell on America and sometimes sparked sparks.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who work in the world 2.2 million people, left their post to organize strike tickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the company stores whose products are intended for consumers of modest and medium-sized classes.
Walmart commercializes everything: layers of hunting rifles passing through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% less expensive than in the major supermarkets.
That's why a lot of poorly paid employees at Walmart only run at their place of work.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to the critics, Walmart can sell its products in the market, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
The latter are also complaining about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lifting carriages or portable scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" events demanded an increase in wages, and they complained that the company's medical insurance price had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
For Walmart's basic salary that affects $9.5 an hour, it's a sum he can't afford.
Scientists at Berkley University in California show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
It is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all the increase in salaries to the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store would return to 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12,39 in one year more than now.
Walmart's participants were pleased to note that protests had taken place in only nine States and did not harm the group.
The "Monday Black" continued in the 8 a.m. shops at midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5,000 items in the second half of this period.
Its cash registers have carried out a total of 100 million transactions for the "Monday Black".
Dan Fogleman's spokesperson assured in an interview with the Huffington Post left, that in any "less than five" employees from Walmart had left their positions and that the protest was only "a com' operation among so many others" of the organizer's union.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and were no longer about Walmart shops (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, so they are not yet implanted) but the McDonald's and other well-marketed restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage provided for by federal law and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
The fast-foods increase them over time, but on average, their basic employees reach $8.90 per hour.
No one touches less than them in this city.
For me it's inconceivable to live with this sum in New York.
It was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living at their parents' home.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, there are comments on the Wall Street Journal forum that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
The protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 p.m. near McDonald's on the 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, i.e. more than double the current minimum wage.
They also asked for the establishment of trade unions in the fast restoration sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing the Protestants of a union by brutes or dismissals.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, getting rid of the fast restoration remains a difficult task, and this, for concrete reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree.
Other stormy events were held near several other fast restoration chains.
The stage of the protest was the meeting in the middle of the day near McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's announces sale of billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and do not pay you the work you have done honestly!".
The demonstrators were supported by other New Yorkers in view, including the candidate at the post of Mayor Bill De Blasio, who stated that "we all have to support the workers of the rapid restoration so that they get a fair wage and the economic well-being that each New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important event the fast restoration sector has ever known in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, but not all were fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is for the moment difficult to tell if this mass movement spark will make small ones.
"For the time being, we only get to the middle of the brain."
Recently, fans of new technologies used to perceive the increased reality through special glasses.
In the beginning, it was Google that released this summer's current model at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it is evident from the maintenance with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Microsoft laboratory of Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this society, the glasses are already from the ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of handling virtual objects in the bare air, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Can you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine, and at the same time we try to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Mankind as a whole has remained so for the time being at the pixels on the flat screen and sometimes at the touchline.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years before us and become the radical changes that will take place with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the command by the gesture.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has made physical interaction, many things take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The acquisition of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance is not real for the moment.
We're trying to change this and we're working on real 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of our world, in the physical world, to make it more tactical.
For this, however, we need to identify not only the user, but also the space surrounding him.
Thus, we will be able to complete the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of the voice command?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overrated?
It cannot be said that it is panic: the issue of confidentiality is being raised because we do not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each one in its niche.
For example, in order to command devices in public places, we had a project for which we retire to gestures, not broad gestures, but to discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is now large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- That's what I'm saying?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this pen?
You'll do it with the word and the gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt depending on what the machine can or cannot do at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
These can be laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth, and this is very important.
- If you're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you don't like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is about the current generation that we are based on our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get about 8 megapixels at 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, and this adds to the work of algorithms designers.
The resolution must be kept in mind according to X and Y, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s are not really enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Batiche, from our Redmond lab, gave the sensors a regular delay of treatment between 1 and 100 μs, and the current sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand the extent to which this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would really need a device of this kind in my work, but I don't need to touch, to have more frames on the second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect today has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other one, a reflective signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It does not serve to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or imperish it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a similar flexible product in Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present his glasses to the audience.
Do you not think that from a daily point of view of the use of the technologies of increased reality, the glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitor" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes them strong (the personal elements are those you are the only to see) and at the same time their weakness: the increased reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the handling of virtual holographic objects in the air is only more accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to mere mortals.
There's a problem where the opponents point the finger to this idea: there's no touchy feeling!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your group's responses to this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh perversion in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be very good at adding tactical sensations.
For the moment, one of the most interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
She records the pressure perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of an air blow on the fingertips.
There are also bracelets on the wrists that affect the nerve terminals of the fingers, they are also a working axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool your brain?
Does he believe that he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below which it will still have to be done for a long time: the way to make someone physically in a very small space who walks in an almost endless open space - we work on the concepts of racing carpets (not to be seen with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the moment, there is only average brain failure, and many years of work still remain.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersbourgian Frontier" dedicated to the citizens who are in advance, to the pre-guard of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors in the art scene of Saint Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city border and who have found recognition in Europe after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverti painter Kirill Miller.
All the city knows Kirill Miller, this man rather than barbu, all of the red clothes that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the parties and linked decorations.
Kirill Miller's tables always gather the crowds, regardless of their place of exhibition.
It is one of the fundamentals of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an outstanding representative of the Petersbourgeois Guard of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and gives them a good humour.
He recently took in his hands a barbaric pride and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg, since he had done enough for this difficult role of his existence, philosophy and his image of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you run the city all red and not turquoise yellow or blue, for example?
- I chose the red as a specialized cook in the appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between painting, image creator and society.
Even in society, everything that is not gray causes aggression and a negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Palais de la culture Nevskiy where my work was.
I realized it was my way.
So the wave of the old non-official paintings was gone and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to associate myself with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10", and then there was no more wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds except words.
It was important for me to find myself in the center of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995, I took place in Puchkinskaya-10, which was a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the petersbourgese bohememe.
Many were born there: The NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Cnour and his friends sang easy play-back songs in moving puzzles, they included among them Igor Vdovin, a fashion composer today.
When the group started to produce live, it became Leningrad.
Trakhtenberg did not encourage bad emissions before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was when his great career began, but his training and his basic education, he received them from us.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboiedov": these are the implications of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees have gone there as usual.
I'm a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the price "The personalities of our city".
I've been named "The End of the Year", and that's when my reign is over.
It is not easy to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, we can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- A lot of my tables are hits, they have a very high current and a very strong acuteity.
I'm going to have a programmed exhibition "The Russian Museum through the clowns".
The clowns belong to a temporary category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's scared to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything goes away, the tragic fall.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory decoupling.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but instead we need to crack him at the trunk.
And the lie will be eliminated by deception.
We've recently seen you in the role of Barbara's organ player, a cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else I can play with.
- But maybe commercial art can be nice, too?
- Today commercial art must be cared for, delicate, liquid.
A deintegration of culture is currently taking place.
Before, people were divided into groups, the bohemian participants loved one thing, the next.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollars ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you like.
Each one sees 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people who have been thrown out who come to see it, it's the sex and social side that goes on.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come, and at the end of the account is less management, money, all desperate.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to cheat them, not to waste their lives.
When I was young, I thought of the tables that a collector had set up next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables that are usually the ones that we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, consumption culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and lived in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of the culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that good experts should be kept.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in Saint Petersburg who might be experts, but they are gone, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and guide them on their way.
Currently, it is the "king of taste" that flourishes.
The same Erarta, but they differ in this sense that they honestly say that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are paintings that need to be found in other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- Saint-Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a land for this.
And on our stones, art is bad to push.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At our house, this bed is very nice.
We must make art fashion as it was at the beginning of the last century.

Zoom to fit in
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with land on board depart to search for a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a great question arises: how to continue to bring our species to life as a predator or even on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are two real planets that can be won, it would be only by hypothesis.
"It is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, researcher at the Astronomical Institute of State P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live in very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We started to take an interest in reproduction issues in space by focusing on the flower.
Another half century ago, we had experiments on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown on orbit did not differ in any way from land varieties.
Then we put on insect orbits, small reproductive Drosophilic flies.
In 1979, sheep were sent to space to see how an embryo developed as an anesthetist.
We get a completely normal dust at the exit.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is that the dust needs to be supported, it needs to be put on its legs and start moving," explains the director of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By not finding any support, the dusts dealt in a disorientated way.
And at the end of 10 hours, the new babies were seeing their instincts completely atrophy.
The dust did not respond to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die at the end of four days.
"We took their eyes twice, and then we left, because it's just impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, finding the failure of experience with dust in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago.
Experiences will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only cover species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetuses in space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still biosatellites and then it was the only experience to do this kind of research," noted Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are still not possible directly in space.
It's not a bad thing.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to achieve their sexual instincts.
Unlike beasts, man is capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not achieved for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has more precious.
Our moustache flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retired from the field of rockets and space.
In June 1964, just one year after his flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaiev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice on orbit and even working in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, there is a risk of losing it.
We have little, even very few cosmonauts who have nothing and give birth to a offspring in full health after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbital flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, heroes of the Soviet Union and heroes of Russia, Valerie Poliakov.
However, mankind must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero floatability, the cosmonauts enter the extra-vehicle exits.
The water imitates the predator.
If for adults, water is comfortable but yet a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.
The small amphibians seem to confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby moves about 9 months into the lymphatic fluid of her mother's belly, it is easier for her to get used to water.
It is logical in principle, because from its birth to its first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the swim instructor for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just born the predator is a more natural condition, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
In tightness, the muscles of the belly, the bass are atrophy very quickly, the baby's push capacity is lost.
All right, let's ignore this by relying on the delivery simulators.
We can certainly prepare a shelter in a special room, and the woman will be able to get it out.
"And then?" asked Valerie Poliakov to ask to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the earthly attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You cannot dress a baby as an adult with a special combination for training.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case, assuming the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return on Earth of a disabled child, completely dissatisfied," says Igor Pestov, Director of the Committee for Bioethics of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time, this will become a reality, when the Terrains will turn into their ships to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Higher Institute for Public Finance Control) said: "The control of the independent pseudo work (Czech " Švarc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is on the move for its implementation.
That is what Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Higher Public Finance Control Institute, said in an interview for Aktuální.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what makes a flaw in us," said Kala in her comment on the current situation.
A joint control by the Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited the approach of " Švarc system " as an example of abusive practice by Petr Necza.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that ODS was not going to import contractors with checks; is it allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority responsible for investigating compliance with the law," said Kala.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee in the House of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project that compared the public procurement legislation of the two countries.
What was he specifically asking about?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public markets and specific national legislation, as well as a practice that follows it.
We have gathered all this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more severe and of better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is best in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not sufficient to continuously develop more detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project be of practical help to you, and what is the result for you?
A joint control of this kind should help us to stop trying to clarify the laws, reduce and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the issue at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and any criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds of the markets, this goal will not be achieved by force.
It could be that this system is so submerged by the paper, that those who seek it will find much more opportunities than if the threshold remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different way of organizing?
In the case of institutions, similar to the ISC, the Bundesreichningshof, which is organized in a similar way, also has a slightly different advice, but these two institutions are essentially acting in a similar manner .
The powers are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, therefore it also has a course of such accounts at the level of the different Lands.
BHR can only control the federal money, which corresponds to the state's resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities in our country are under control at the level of the Länder's accounts.
With regard to national legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often designated as a model but it cannot be said that it does better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I don't have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we consider to be a model is also faced with a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, would they?
With regard to national legislation, which has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the Public Market Act, have its effects already been felt?
Since this amendment has recently entered into force, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we carry out subsequent checks, we have to deal with a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, at the moment, the process of preparing for future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "detection of the risks of bad management" with which we have gone to the crib close to 14,000 public markets - these changes will well be heard because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law to be an advantage or an overload for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more severe and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulation, the provider (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) was obliged to accept that any breach of the Markets Act meant a lack of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but do not punish those who make formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will increase the pressure on the administration.
So what's the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that ODS was not going to import entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be properly applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority from inspecting and demanding compliance with the law.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and authorize it," but he can't say that we're going to act as if it was nothing.
The Markets Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, and that is precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder will be eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and it is, in my opinion, what makes a flaw in us.
The roads are frozen, but most remain practical.
In some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowed.
However, the network remains largely practical, in some places with increased surveillance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practical this morning, but also by frozen and snowy places.
The temperatures fell and oscillated between -5° and -10° C, but they should be slightly up in the day.
Snowfalls have stopped in the region and there is only a thin snowfall in the plains.
However, the crests of the Metalifers Monts (Krušné hory) are covered about 30 centimeters of snow.
There are data from the regional road maintenance service that due to the drill, visibility was reduced by places.
The fast R6 route and the national roads in the region are now feasible without difficulty.
However, surveillance remains to be set, for example, on certain bridges where the coating can be frozen and smooth.
All departmental roads and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also practical.
There are still some of their sections of the ice snow remnants and by places taxed by traffic.
Especially in high altitude areas, drivers need to strengthen their surveillance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Roads and Roads Directorate reports on its website that some roads in Eastern Bohème are threatened by the formation of glass and that snow layers charged by traffic can be found on roads in mountainous and high altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of glazing in areas in the high altitude of the Pardubice region.
There may be glass in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, and this, mainly on the departmental roads and in the third category.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Switzerland were chemically treated.
The snow is mainly found in the Monts des Giants (Krkonoshe) and the Monts de l'Aigle (Orlicé hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a snowy layer of traffic is present on the roads in the altitude areas.
In Bohème de l'Est, the time will now be dry, most often exhausted, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will generally go between -3° and +1° C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practical, although, by places, there is a need for increased monitoring and adaptation of its conduct to weather conditions.
It cools this morning, temperatures rise between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and the cooling that followed, some communication routes may be frozen.
Drivers can expect to pass through areas of fog, but visibility will improve gradually.
This is the result of information from the regional road maintenance service.
However, the D5 motorway is almost without difficulty, the road communications maintenance services recommend increased surveillance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most national roads are dry and frozen.
Some trunks can be frozen in the Pilsen-South district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third-category roads are wet and, in this case, the protection against ice-creams is applied.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less frequent roads in the Shuma region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers in the high altitude areas of the Olomouc region today have to have a thick and wet snow layer on the roads.
This layer remains on the col called "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after the chemical treatment operations.
Snowfalls forced road maintenance staff to go to the ground that night; according to the bus services, it fell more than three centimeters in the Shumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most shoes are practical without difficulty.
" On the heights of the Shumperk district are snowfalls.
Drivers walking in the direction of Jeseník should wait to meet at the col called "Červenohorské sedlo" a thick and soft snow layer "today in ČTK declared the head of the maintenance services of the Šumperk district roads.
Their colleagues in the district of Jeseník also settled during the night; according to them, after the chemical treatment performed, the roads are now derailed and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are easy to reach, but in the district of Šternberk the drivers should be careful in the sections in forest areas to the wet shoes.
Ústí nad Labem and Liberec regions
Since this morning, the North Bohème Road Maintenance Services reported several difficult crossings.
There is evidence from the police that, in addition to certain snow or glass areas, the mountain road from Telnice to Knnínice na Ústecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below zero at a lower altitude, so snow and glass should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south east of the Central Plateau de Bohème, there is, on the contrary, no problems and roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported for the time being.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of glass, including around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow source during the day, sky drained and ice during the night.
It is also reported, from the main traffic axes, difficult conditions on national road 13 to the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that curved under the snow weight until they reach the shoe.
Šimon Ornest said, "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of these new alarms, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our The Tap Tap group, we regulate rather than say that we are the only group capable of collecting a rest of positive energy in order to give up or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are setting up a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project more in detail to our readers?
It is a charity that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the potential marketing of the Maya calendar announced for 21 December at 11 a.m.
On 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end when the Maya calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, located in the Pacific Ocean, on a 12-hour advance zone compared to us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys to the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded a hymn against the end of the world, which is entitled " End of the world cancelled " (Czech " Konec wjdja zrušeno ").
It's already very popular on YouTube, will you understand it also during these charity concerts?
Of course, at last, if we succeed and the end of the world doesn't take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all interpreters in the three concerts.
Hymns will also meet at a given time in the context of a live broadcast, in fact uniquely, of Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also holds the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X sings as well...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech show-biz personalities, because we organize many concerts and charity events...
We strive to make them actively involved in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it is fun.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studio training centre that is accessible to people with reduced mobility and whose work we have been working on within the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap Association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit students at the Jedlikkov Institute and offer them activities that interest them and entertain them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to an independent new building.
Several music and interpreter groups will be on stage at each of these concerts?
What criteria do you have?
We have tried to develop a programme that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will go on stage Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; here we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic's house in New York and personally, once in place in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not that terrible that it looked first.
We have five electric armchairs whose gears must travel in support, of course we also trim a lot of luggage and tool boxes....
Until everything went well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we've come back recently, everything has happened without problems.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of the public opinion for persons with disabilities and so on.
What has been your experience so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do, we have just witnessed in Moscow that it is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there it is not yet common for a person to move alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They still do not consider it an evidence of giving priority to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
What are the more developed countries in which we must find ourselves?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts made by the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather opposite to the point of progress!
Respect for the public and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers.
For the time being, it is only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what moved you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlikka Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people who are willing to invest in something.
And as I am myself a musician (I play, among other things, from the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a musical activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Ládźa Angelovic says, we have a little lost control of the situation.
Has success only happened in the last few years, if I don't cheat?
It is true that creating links with known singers and working actively to promote the group has helped us.
We realized that if a job is not visible, it's like it didn't exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union grants, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap?
At first, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of stuff that copy each other.
In some ways, it is logical: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts for a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I tend to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is of course mercy, it is natural ...
But mercy is completely useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned of all, that we must take in mercy.
They are people who can live a whole life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of sure.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it is not just an advance for them but for the whole society.
Is your success not also due to being a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's totally normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to repetitions twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the streets for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap Group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
A seul, Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people go in and out, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the day of the coming end of the world, Thursday, 20 December 2012, starting at 21 hours.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relays when the song of the group The Tap Tap " End of the Canceled World " will be sung together.
The purpose of the concert is to collect financial resources (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the Studio multifunctional training centre in Prague in the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, the entry is free for children up to 12 years old, the ticket prevention is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the Countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of that agency, the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the years it has participated in a number of Agency projects.
Poland's road to space, however, began much earlier.
Already before World War II, passionate Poles worked on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the conference of A. Sternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from his avant-garde work entitled " Introduction to Astronautics ".
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left cold audiences and years later Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize in France for his work "Introduction to Astronautics".
Ledit Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) then became a major promoter of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a promoter of world-renowned astronauts, and his contribution has been rewarded, in particular, by his name being given to one of the Moon's hidden faces.
From 1925 a drone was built in Poland to be equipped with a fired engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of the project are known.
It is no longer clear if the rifle should be used to push or stop the drain.
The only information known about this drama is that of the press of the time.
Starting in 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the rifles.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It appears that this research has reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, the plans for a photoelectric hunt, drawn by the Rohozinski engineer, appeared in the specialized press and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda voietrzna i raketobomba altnicza" was published by a writer named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
The two projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of fusion technology were carried out by the interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Doradczo-Naukowy Committee), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war put an end to its activities.
After the war, other works devoted to aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish astronaut society (Polishe Towarizvo Astronautique).
For the first time, it is a matter of a company in the November 1954 issue of the Problem Journal, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowiczé, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to astronautism.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research was in the future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the International Astronautic Federation (established in 1951) and as early as the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, PTA's first president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the international astronaut federation.
He maintained his post until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM Meteorological Fuse (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish Fuse to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This shell of 1,800 metres had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
An improved version was then built, RM-1A and, during the summer of 1959, two-storey RM-2 flight tests were started in the Bledov desert.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 metres and was probably 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to perform specific scientific work - the RM-34 rifle should have a width up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind in height.
But in 1963 all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rifle was developed during the period 1962 - 1965, followed by the first RM-type rifles.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had an area offering a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum width of all these types of machinery was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautics institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
Poland's entry to the COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later should be mentioned.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites, and in 1978 pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut.
The repeal of the Public Utility Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Service Act.
This decision raised a lively debate in the public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to examine this issue from a broader point of view.
Economic systems aimed at liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This clearly means that the different economic entities and national economic systems are permanently in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital linked to a fragmented financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of work (wage) generate tension over prices.
The following meaning should be put to the fore: a producer is trying to import low-sales goods to withstand economic competition by " making the price of the competitor more expensive, in order to remove a larger part of the market and thus increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either to transfer production abroad, or to buy at low prices, or to disappear. The result is an important unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Given that private capital has no social responsibility and thus the same responsibility for the purpose of unemployment it creates, the social burden of the State is increasing necessarily.
This whole situation reinforces the perfect will of employers to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole through this race for profit.
This situation is at such a public level that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in different economies a situation in which governments of different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments place their own population at the mercy of private capital without regard for social collapse.
This is reflected primarily in the amendments to the existing laws.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the dictatorship of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages.
This is done on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and on the other hand by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening differences between the rich and the poor.
In RFA, there have been years of public food distribution points for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees to receive such wages as the State is forced to pay an extra to achieve the minimum vitality.
For example, such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of practically all the Member States of the south of the EU generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to migrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with poor wages, on the side of society, in hopes that one day private capital will invest in their countries.
Here we have to ask the following question: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come anymore, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a European wage.
This also applies to all Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim that the State cannot invest in capital in its own economy, that the economy is leading to an economic disaster.
The private capital strongly advocates the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It must then be asked whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not govern, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the whole state.
The answer to this question is no doubt yes.
The evidence is that there is practically all-powerful and present lobby in all States.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through mutual advantage, in legislation, where everything is punishable but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, national departments delegate the development of legislation to firm law firms that are closely related to industry.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
The whole of power is not from the people, as the Western-style constitutions say, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that the liberalism-oriented democracies are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book "the crisis of the Roman Empire at the time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State has long been in full delicacy and the functions were attributed to violence.
Potassium cuttings, illegally obtained favorages, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The under-tables and corruption would spread without limits, and the people would turn to the elections with already sold votes" ... "The honest people were never trying to get a job, it results once the state remains 8 months without consultation."... 'It really began to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... It is true that Appianos had the Pompey spirit, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absoluteist regime.
In conclusion, as in the past, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, regardless of the interests of the society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and asserting the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, today as in the past, a decade without previous elites, without any effort to make profound reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in liberalization without screws from the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal-type democracies can be seen as a sort of break before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human life, the humanitarian and social crises that we are witnesses to today and the crimes against humanity as we know them from the past and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Service Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international level and at the European internal level, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is in fact systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of private capital monopoly in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and will never be able to," says Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose main verse of refrain is "we don't forget how weak we are."
"If my son didn't want war, there would be no war," said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his death bed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have been raised.
Some take the part of Israel, asserting their right to self-defence and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, calling for the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs and Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is the victim of repeated killings in his waves; however, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in this political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer the readers a point of view "on the back of the curtain", on which they mainly benefit from the tensions that have been lost for more than 95 years (from the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East country.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others are based on my own understanding of it, or more precisely on the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of a struggle for power.
At any time, we can find an Alexandre the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they had to take their actions to the throne to someone who guided their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when the world's wealth is concentrated between the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been able to occur in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth is the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the forest (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
It's not written about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s, they acquired the first world press agency (Reuters) to put an end to the linkage between their name and serious criminal acts to which they were involved and which had always meant strengthening their power, increasing their wealth or both.
They had major participation in almost most of the world's central banks and prepared or led wars against countries in which they had not yet had such participation (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of those countries was 7 after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the return of Kadhafi only 4, Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Everyone who has tried to move against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew to the Bank of America of Rothschild the status of the central bank and went to issue his own money during the civil war (government, I understand well) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue own money and wanted to disband the FED, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936, while he wanted to try a trial against the FED for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a three-world war plan by Albert Pike, a 33rd-degree freelance, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating Europe's major state monarchies, the second was to eliminate colonialism, particularly British, and the third was to reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the amorce of such a solution) and finally acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then to propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order of chaos).
These solutions are false and lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to avoid repeated crises such as those that occurred in 1907).
Having succeeded in triggering the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, the successor of Habsburg to the Austro-Hongrog throne, they destroyed the Tsariist Russia by causing the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the massacre of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier launch of the second world war, the bankers have allowed politicians to create a latent conflict situation: on the one hand, they have imposed on Germany pharaminous war repairs, thus generating the conditions for radicalization of the adhesionous masses (they are then sufficient to place a sufficiently energetic leader, with the finger of the guilty, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, create a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority that was supposed to play the fifth column (which it actually had) to light the powders and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aspires to the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the basis for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on the one hand and on the other.
The second world war broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the channels in which international bankers had originally held it; or if everything he had planned was, however, the fact is that the sufferings of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that war repairs imposed on Germany were at the origin of World War II, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a firehouse that could cause a third world war.
If international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the wars, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it's enough to see how people are clearly divided between Israeli partyers and defenders).
Who is guilty and who is victim to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one tortoise another tortoise according to an endless circle of violence and where, in the beginning, we find the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire power over the world?
There must be a difference here between the mere citizens of Israel and their leaders, because like us, international bankers offer people elections only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascist politicians, loyal to international bankers, who do their best to start a war with Iran, which could, due to its accession to Shanghai's cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the destruction of Ormuz by which 20% of the world's oil transit (this naval corridor has a width of only 2 thousand) and creates a destruction of the world economy.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller now appear in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance are used by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new born sees itself implanting at birth an electronic puzzle that makes it completely controlled.
"Let all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slave to wear a red iron mark on their hand or forehead, so that he can neither buy nor sell the person who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood: that the person who has good sense takes into account the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number refers to the man and it's six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protestors made up of Islamic students took over the American Embassy of Tehran and held 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer the American administration a positive outcome, and it could not, in fact, abandon Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow for the prestige of the United States, still worsened later by the fiasco of the attempt to release hostages by force.
The sequestrian diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate in the United States sparked a wave of solidarity and an anti-Ranish feeling.
The Iranian debacle strongly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by the actor and stager Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offers a small victory in America.
Just before she was employed, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated periods, they were found in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran by means of a rock cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a tour team to track a large-scale science-fiction film.
Combination of genres
Tony Mendez's exfiltration expert plan requires Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company, or office reals.
The details of the operation remained long secret, the film being based on Tony Mendez's memories.
The Afleck film is an unusual combination of several kinds.
This is part of a political thriller designed in a realistic way, but also a "moved caper", the story of a success, of a betrayal - such as in the Ocean trilogy's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The ambience follows: the sequences of Tehran's documentary style (in the sub-titles there are iconic photographs of the time of events and the way in which these photos have retransscribed these same situations in the film, there are no major differences),
the lighter passes of Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
and then the scenes of the CIA headquarters and other institutions with custom men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in relaunching his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculous actor, he became a respected actor and his game of actor ceased to generate ironic remarks.
Argo is his third long story after the police shadow " Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It's also the first Afleck movie that doesn't take place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where Tehran's role "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity, which also suggests confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in fictitious scenes (the false tournament team in the Tehran Basar).
Too many actions in too many places
The stager had to be content with a subject offering only a few palpative scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It turns out very well, it sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant as it is (the scene in which the threat of a crisis at Teheran airport is separated by a telephone blow in America and the pursuit on the landing track is quite drawn by the hair).
Argo's weakness is in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it were true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are really charming in their role as Hollywood co-operatives, their characters would have earned a bigger place and that they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
The Afleck film lacks some dramatic tension, it is shown with a moderate interest, appreciating the realization and retro style of the 1970s.
He's training the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of another story, in some way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of secret services as omnipotents and omnipotents, he does the case.
Rules for throwing balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts a public survey every year on the most absurd banking costs, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, the adoption of a 40 per cent female quota for the management of large European enterprises was at the root of our decision," said the organizer of this survey, Patrick Naker, for the Pravo newspaper.
Among the absurdities mentioned are, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Up to now, however, women were benefiting from life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk to insurance companies.
People can report to the end of the year any other incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013", Naner said.
Among the EU's contested regulations are, for example, the obligation to add bio components to fuels, which has harmful environmental consequences, or the prohibition of using reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively low amount of hazardous substance or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to an increase in egg prices.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the prohibition of the use of the term "tartine butter" or the withdrawal of the sale of classical ampoules.
Quality bananas must be 14 cm in size.
The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (i.e. the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, because in the Union bananas should not be of a size less than 14 cm or of an "abnormal curve".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonizing non-homogeneous national standards that were complicated in trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have been adopted despite the opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives result in food consumption.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey in the EU regulation last year, according to which a warning must be given on the inflatable balloons indicating that children under 8 years of age should not be inflamed without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an American survey that found balloons to be the first cause of children's deaths per strike.
A similar restriction applies to children less than 14 years of age for what is to blow in faeces.
We've got some weird ideas, too.
The following rule regarding European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, anyone with an official EU function cannot use the name "Macedonian" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the Association "Let Do" bringing together liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server named in this survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the Union regulation on the volume of food reserves in the Czech Republic.
The EU has set maximum volumes for food reserves that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for preserved mushrooms and risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of the survey considered it interesting to pay money to some countries because they did not have access to the sea and the idea to grant a grant to apply for grants.
However, these ideas are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have the sea is scaring us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund."In the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) expressed himself.
It was argued that, due to our production of wheat, and as a result of the so-called "interventionists" purchases, the State had met with full stocks that it had then to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
Finally, the European Commission has responded positively to the Czech request and has organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, led by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), which was specifically intended to be used to prepare applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU states: 'the strange regulations are rare'.
If the regulations often raise criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the efficiency of the Union's operation and its overall development deserve praise.
More serious, for example, is the problem of the use of EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which were imposed by Member States during budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, fights in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (which it does not always win) gives rise to vivid emotions in the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomucké vorzóky", for what the name "Tuzemský rum" refers to as "Tuzemský rum" that dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only canned sugar products, not beet sugar, can bear the name of rhum.
In the official list of EU registered products, today we find in the company of world-famous cheeses such as the Feta or the Gorgonzola, the Lübeck massepain or the Parme jambon, the cookies of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carpes of Pohorelice et de Třebonský kár ("Pohorelský a Třebonský kár") and the Žatec hablon ("Zatecký chmel").
The bread of Pardubice ("Parubicý perník") and the gâteaux called "Cornets de Horíce " ("hořicý trubicky") can also be proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Mr. Senator, how do we intend to present ourselves to the presidential elections?
It's not a senator or president who counts for me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I wouldn't be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been robbed for the past 20 years, that thieves are not under the locks and taxes and the age of retirement increases.
I didn't have the ambition of becoming a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I try to make a solution for it to change.
And as I am more than forty years old and as an independent member of no party, I have no other solution to influence the situation than to present myself to the presidential or Senate elections.
You entered the Senate, but you were quickly on your way to Château (N.d.T.: Presidency seat).
Isn't that how you turn your back on those who chose you?
I've always said that I'm going to be launched in the battle for Château according to the results of the Senate elections
I then explained that if I were elected senator, I would be present at the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that enables me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the widest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we meet at the bar or in front of our television station, but that we also catch all those who are trying to bring about change.
This is added to the press that breaks the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom of speech.
For example, it has been said to me that I am subpoenaing journalists or that I have been the advisor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's come to your visions.
You have begun the fight for Château with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retrospective tax returns beyond twenty million [of CZK].
To that end, you must change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I put pressure on tourist guide activities to be a liberal profession, I got a cause gain.
The problem is politics: when someone comes to the left or the right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of either party, I have much more chance of obtaining the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and participatory dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you rather consider yourself a man of the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel that people like me rather to the left.
For me, whether it's a little to the left or a little to the right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we're going ahead.
What counts for me is not that people are left or right but to gather people.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the ODS, and I am also totally against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have an optimal purpose and a vision.
You're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have talked about them.
But without Parliament's support, you only have slogans.
You won't live long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will, for example, succeed in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have any other options.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to get them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected President, it would not be a problem to direct my request to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
Then they should possibly explain why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the President to direct suffrage, which was obtained through the pressure of public opinion.
I'm just, without ambassies, being an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just started out in politics and I'm trying to get the majority support for my program.
I'm just trying to move things forward, and if that doesn't work out, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person cannot make the difference, so I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to also present themselves to the Senate elections.
I met Radim Janchura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová who exposed the frauds in the bush.
I was introduced because people are really discontented, but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did most of them gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
People have chosen a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the election to the direct suffrage of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning on foundationing your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if the past of each potential member is intact and then I don't have the financial resources.
I don't have any more money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax statements, what's yours?
I value about 60 million of my personal property.
I have in Prague a land value of 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
As it turned out, I had an Aston Martin because it was a boy's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving in the car, was fighting with women and fighting evil and abuse.
You're in Aston Martin, you have a 60 million-dollar property and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money there?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
You think I should go for it?
I've already invested 2 million and a half in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not of great interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign costs are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live in it, for example, pay my son's English school that costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I would not submit to any election.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities in the background?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Prava.
The architects of the cabinet MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To be sure, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenenisse and the newly erected book mountain - 2 photos
"I find that this building is boring, it makes very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the bottom of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computerist in a large neighboring company, tells us, "Yes, it's really nice, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
Today, no one's going to do his best in one of these thank-you libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a town-dortoir that has nothing to attract to the gates of Rotterdam, holds a fairly special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls displays the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to bring some neurons back to the brain, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that are on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small miniatures in painted concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
That is how the city's authorities realized that there was only one way to regain the hand on the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, of the architect's office of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of bold bat diagrams and creator of mind-filled and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with its usual flag and presented to the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a recharge on his face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking down and rising the shoulders, Maas, the front, emplied his books of choice by size to make a pyramid, and ended his speech with a "common love!"
Here's my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, or as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million-euro mountain on the ground floor.
The building is included in a revitalization project including a underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few furniture and mythological houses for a total of 50 rooms.
At the beginning of November, the bookstore received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is how this small black bourgeoisie, which so far had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a mare of an audacious laity, whose white façades invite to think that they are opening a laity, is enriched by contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building of his history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Of course, an elevator carries you to the heart of the massif, but the true joys of reading and architecture are open to you when you dig the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The entire interior made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant reverbers speak without any doubt the language of the municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking at public banks, dogs and little boys and girls playing at the dance.
And everywhere there are books, books, and more books.
"Of course, library beams are located along the façade and in the middle there is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We have completely disrupted the classical space configuration and opened the reading spaces from inside to outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been well-equipped: the offices are located in the middle, the Internet library, the chess club, the environment center and the technical center of the building.
A special beauty is found in the black beams of the library, which are both lambs, both balustrades, and stairs.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the solid building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project with the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in an agricultural company.
In the Netherlands, the synthetic membrane of a millimetre of thickness has been used for years as a substrate in the cervix and fields.
It's a good market, and we're running out of time.
The membrane end is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, including both a new car and sports shoes.
Top of 105 marches is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us an impressive view of the city, but also of Dutch croquettes and pot figurines.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute mainly to maintaining the ideal level of humidity in the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Soul
"It's amazing, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model ecology project," reports Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is controlled by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass clock, the sun only sheds light on the inside, even the days of good time.
The thick wooden poles mounted through the glass beam serve as a para-solil, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated stores are responsible for the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the so-called septic computerist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
Cynthia Bogde, professor of Chinese traditional medicine, even described Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, each citizen was invited to make a book from his own library.
This measure made it possible to fill the voids of the library that was not yet completely garnie (now, it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has reached the master discipline called "the creation of an identity" in the professional jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even though she may appear young and uneducated.
This is finally a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany chose the abstention during the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians' request to obtain observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose the abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, since it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think that she no longer supports the American position.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but did not show too much criticism of Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya of March 2011, Germany had also chosen abstention when voting on the establishment of an air-exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposes this measure.
Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is revising its foreign policy, seeking to withdraw from a policy so defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are therefore faced with several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still working to find this role, but they are on the path of a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or Great Britain
What, then, does the term "normal" for Germans mean in particular?
It shows the willingness to adopt independent positions of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national files.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of the other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect Germany's position towards the conflict in the Middle East and the abstinence in the United Nations vote?
Germany has first of all major outbreaks in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to offend the public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive element.
However, I would not give too much importance to it, because it is not a purely unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive element in German strategic reflections.
Does Germany sleep in its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think that the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are different.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and most European countries?
There have always been differences due to the American domestic policy scene.
I believe that the Obama administration has shown a great deal of understanding about the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot of course defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences in opinion are not so great that they always appear to be.
If you observe the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from being enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes things easy for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not the case.
They cannot therefore join a broader political line and must affirm their individual position.
That is what they are currently doing in the euro issue.
In my view, Germany will take a role as locomotive in the future and push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been sensitive.
But I believe that the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a weight player on the international stage, and does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or is it still difficult to take the lead?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still experiencing difficulties in playing a more important role.
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, we note that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
This does not make things easy for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must be made up of very diverse neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy only diminishes, but at this point the EU does not fill this gap, while who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if they don't like it and if they're less appreciated, it's life!

"Protection of Brands" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are famous brands throughout the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially deposited in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand thus enjoys protection such that the company that bears its name cannot bear complaint.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd get a cause.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer from the firm Taylor Wessing specialized in violation of property law in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
The simulators only need a few extra letters to be able to record their marks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports articles.
Pattloch opens a classroom in which are the recordings made at the Beijing brand office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company filed the Zegna DF Puma brand, a name that the firm artificially created by fitting part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a fact known that the Chinese have become champions of the world of copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are commercial centres on several floors that sell practically only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his mandate is to attack the fact that the Chinese brand office officially confers on Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese are talking about "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
In this sense, women who marry rich men are designated.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch says.
"The mark is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is huge."
Financial losses and justice costs are in millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to the cost-effective products.
According to the CLSA market analysis company data, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest-growing world market.
However, it is not easy to root out the dubious registrations of the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter may last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reported the proceedings in which the court dismissed the complaint, because after a long period the critical name had become a "reality of the market".
Pattloch tells us that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the beach because he would have damaged his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Celebrating cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the Sany machine manufacturer, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's buyer, used a blue and white logo that reminded him of BMW. The conflict was regulated and Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the beachmen of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reorientated the view of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The office of the CTMO brands in Beijing, however, admits to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have passed last year on a "emergency situation in the course of the work to a normality found".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures remain in the office.
Run cost
As often as in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
According to the office, it is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time in the head of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also be worth the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each registration reported an average of EUR 1,280, or EUR 160.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Of course, the Germans were able to obtain suspension of the illegal manufacture of vehicle components.
However, the simulator was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"It is our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, president of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities Directorate in Munich.
The trade mark office had therefore rejected the municipality's objection.
Freudenberg has gained some cause from the following two instances, but the opposing party continues to fight to this day.
Caution is to be exercised
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, trialsome and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archive service has even had to review the past hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "large sum in euro at six figures" to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see, what it represents for us," Wentzler confides.
The dangers of the Far East threaten even to reach Europe.
This would be the case if copyrs in this region would ensure the operation of the unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit in Germany the name of Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "vigour is to be put in place".
Pattloch and advise Germany's companies to show great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to be proud of international trade marks law, that foreigners should instead "register all that is likely to be protected in China", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, costs can be much more important than those of registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay licensing rights to the opposing party for the use of his own name, as explained by Wentzler.
Or we will lose our place on the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: foot tap, sing, help
The Imbongi choral repeats in Heidelberg, and the orphans of the AIDS of Swaziland rejoice at their arrival.
Here's the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we tap the foot: cowboy boots, basketball, women's scarves and men's mocassins are looking for rhythm by hitting the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers are slowly amplified - high, low, tenor and soprano - and they are carried out, sent and followed.
Feete Hopf, the 29-year-old orchestral head loses almost his shoe shoes when he runs the orchestra with his gestures of a wild flex.
We are Monday night, the Imbongi choral repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age came from genetics in human medicine to man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorist has different words, all in a very exotic language: the zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some regions of Swaziland.
Helping to Help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is seropositive.
180 orphaned orphans of the village of Estitje found parishes in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary education institution.
For 15 or 20 euros per less, you can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a hot daily meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means "historic content" or "honor of praise".
No one can speak the bantu language properly in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has repeated songs in this foreign language that she has brought to Germany to now make her home region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 kilometres by flight from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choral.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or land, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has brought their parents.
In Esitjeni, the worst-cased diseases in Swaziland can be observed: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest hope of life in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless ensures a proven reduction in the risk of half infection.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population is responsible for the immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to die in the mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. In particular, Imbongis saw many children on the street who not only lacked parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school degree, there is no good prospect.
At first, it was just a few people who made a personal commitment to spending a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But only a year later, the choral founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has been in the hands of the Orphans of the AIDS of Esitnije since then.
Sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial ISTs are syphilis, chlamydiae and blennorrhagia (or gonorrhae).
Current ISTs are HIV, human palillome virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubi’s and neck’s pockets belong to parasitic ISTs.
What are the main groups?
Syphilis and blennorragie are often seen in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute believes that sexual contacts between men are at the root of at least four syphilis cases of five reported in Germany.
Heterosexual adults, Chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fongic), blennorraggia and the human palillome virus are sexually transmitted common diseases.
The prevalence rate of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher incidence of Chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European reports, the three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15-25.
In addition, in Germany, the human palillome virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases was more than doubled in 10 years: the figure increased from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may cause abscess in the level of genital organs, urinary pain, white loss, lower abdominal pain, and the appearance of buttons and glasses.
However, they do not regularly experience any pain or other symptom and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricant infection or close physical contact.
The experts therefore recommend that any person who often changes from sexual partners undergo regular examinations.
Most of the rapidly depleted ISTs can be cured and the late sequences can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, the gifts, but especially the funds collected by the chorists through their voices throughout Germany, the funds accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitje," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman who is sure of herself and always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well-inhabited, at one of their grandmothers, for example.
The gogos, this is what we call old women in the hall, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcome in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for over 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a cooking school and has enabled the construction of two chickens. With the support of the American organization for PSI health, the association has organized a HIV screening test for many inhabitants.
This is not about itself, because although the disease is very visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wives
"Sida is a real taboo," explains Annette Lennartz, "because it's a subject that touches sexuality."
It is quite curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-imposed measures are responsible, inter alia, for the rapid spread of HIV observed over the past few decades.
Migrant workers also spread the virus across the country.
However, we find condoms at each corner of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote some cultural exchange, the Imbongi chorists travel together every two or three years in South Africa and engage in songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people at the point of the Black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
The bus full of whites singing in African is a sign of recognition such as it not only creates good mood and joy, but sometimes also brings tears to a few redoutable guards-frontiers.
The bus always takes them to Esitje, where the chorists visit their daughters.
Even though it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esiteni is well known in the valley of Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitnije, you'll find the light," the people said there.
And after a trip of 8,733 kilometres by flight, back to Heidelberg, in front of these chorists who are covered in the repeat room of the Bergheimer Straße, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters of thickness.
NASA's space agency proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it retains ice water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of a ice cover in the planet's region, permanently floating in the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters that can go up to 20 metres.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercure.
However, no one connects the discovery of water with the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains the scientist in charge of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other essential elements of life have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Inescapable of the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which we observe the infinite.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the planet naine Cerès.
Like Pluto, who orbits around the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the international astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by Telescope Spitzer shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the most difficult points, the most difficult to identify, are the "new-born" in the universe's docking room.
The Telescope Spitzer discovered this region where the stars are born, baptized "W5", a very little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiope, at 6,500 light years.
NASA's Telescope Spitzer photographed the flame-flaming spark of a star as it died.
The ring-shaped circle consists of elements that the star designs when it dies.
In the immense nebulous Trifide, at 5,400 light-years of Earth, the gas and dust form new stars.
The Telescope Spitzer photographed this galactic housing room.
The Pleiades, a love of stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed in the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope puts more color into use.
On this infrared photo, the Nebula of Helica, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years in the constellation of the Verseau.
His similarities to a land continent were worth the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular tent.
Only infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture a picture of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving any trace.
One of the largest and most neatest photographs the Hubble telescope took is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the tent, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the Australian Observatory shows the nebulae of the Trifide in the Sagittarius constellation, to several thousand light-years.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divisioned, divided into three), because three sections of dust divide the heart from the place of birth of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the assumptions of a cosmic carbulation in the constellation of the Serpentaire: at 400 million light-years of the Earth, the nucleus of two fusion galaxies rush each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Australe Roo".
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Nebula of Iris, in the constellation of Céphé.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years and consists of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo was produced from optical and radiographic clicks taken by different telescopes.
There you can see the circle composed of black holes, which is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The Space Telescope has photographed for NASA this group of baptized galaxies Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly berth always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the nebulae of the Rosette, are also constantly creating young stars to 5,000 light years of the Earth.
In this galaxy at the bright rays and perceived from a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was made up of much hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see further and further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope from the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, U.S.A.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Grand Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, on the Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa was segmented to make savings.
The diameter also reaches about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the level of the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the vertical angle.
Its particularity has its great light-collection capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe looking for extra-terrestrial signals using the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "Research for Extraterrestrial Intelligence") by contributing to the calculation power of its machine.
View on the Australian European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("Very Large Telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can shed light on the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take any clicks before 2018 as soon as possible.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They'd take two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that monitors the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and its mirror diameter will reach 30 metres.
This illustration allows you to admire him.
However, the most important images of space come from Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been giving us pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are inhabited.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the beginning of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space as soon as possible in 2018 on board an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
The telescope will have, among other things, a mission to find light designed by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Mercury Pole is also covered by ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercure.
Radar data have been indicating the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercure, scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the proper age of the Bible patriarchs.
There's even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country where we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the proper age of the Bible patriarchs.
There's even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country where we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is a failed romanticism.
Around the many road tours, the small bus cahote along wooden hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh, about which we don't know much, if it's not that they speak perfectly the Persian and the Azeri and they have a very longevity.
Terminus: The current.
The small plastic town with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to walk 323 kilometers, because the road has only one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country must have in its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku has become famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year, there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva explains.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of luck in the world.
There you can discover the life of about eight tens of Talysh from the region who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a picture in black and white.
Here's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Still having a child at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when it is thought that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a daughter.
Şarali Müslümov would he be mistaken for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the man at the great age of Central Asia.
"Schoolz, "Sardaigne too, there are men who live in amazingly old lives in certain regions of China, Japan or the Valley of Hunza in Pakistan."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the absence of documents, however, there was no registration of civil status.
Every day, a deep butter glass
It is true, however, that people in the Lerik region often reach a worthy age from the Bible’s patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years of age.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the azeri tourist guide, explains that the Thalysh have special genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the rich calories of the Thalysh, who likes meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of which drink a deep butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple lifestyle that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a small village near the city of Lerik, living Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With her 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest house of wood, as it is typical to see in the entire Caucasian region.
It sits on the ground next to a bartender, which beats the contents inadvertently.
Eight people live here under one roof, one of the sons of Mirzayeva and one of the daughters, who have long been adults.
Two little kids are also gagging in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests serving in typical bottled glass in the form of a belly.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under its furrow they hide long treasures of a dark blonde that his son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and that they kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," added Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She always ate what came from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes, and small peas.
All my life, I've never bought the least food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "well-loved father" Heydar Aliyev took the orders.
The language of propaganda is amazing in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the fatherly figure of the nation, a man who, however, ruled his country as a dictator, knew almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him afterwards.
Whatever the case, the elderly in Azerbaijan are not aware of the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats monthly (about the same amount as in euro) for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life train in the region.
And perhaps for a long time the son of Mirzayeva is right: "The elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" left in the Constitution
The revolution comes back to Cairo.
Rival manifestations reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft Sharia-based constitution is violently controversial.
The Egyptian President does not have words filled with emotion.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to the whole people, but especially to the Christian Coptics, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the laymen.
Because all members of the confused and desperate opposition are afraid.
They fear a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of powerful Muslim brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his "to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer wants to save, a doctorate of the American University of Southern California.
Will the judiciary be reversed?
The 234 articles drawn up in the autumn by the majority Islamic assembly of 100 people during a 15-hour night force tour are really disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that case-law is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
This was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague formulation and the margin of legal manoeuvre resulting from it to apply a more strict interpretation of the career.
In any event, a newly introduced article provides that, with regard to all subjects touching the charia, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The institution is the country's most important Islamic institution and its glows across the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would in fact lead to the enforcement of the judiciary.
Many of the points of the draft Constitution are relevant to interpretation.
Another problem is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Moubarak, these courts used to oppress the opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, perhaps in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offensive or defamation of the prophet Mahomet or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what is an offence or how it should be punished.
All too doubtful is the wording that makes it clear that it is forbidden to "hate people".
Is it necessary to draw a cartoon of the president or to report a lie to the detriment of a man of law?
Many points are therefore to be interpreted in Morsi's draft vote, which, according to his own words, will be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Regained"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual agreement on Tahrir in Cairo, promising to make the career fall before it enters into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we are going to win," launches Hamdin Sabbai, the third in presidential elections.
The Nobel Prize for Peace and Former Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei, stated that the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the graves of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to promote a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and return it," says Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet exhausted," said Egyptian media reporter Khaled Ali, a political man and a member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim conference called for a counter-manifestation not on Tahrir's place by a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of Cairo University.
The veiled women and the supporters of the Salafists, who participated in it in a large number of ways, were shouting: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, saying that "the Qur'an [was their] Constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Thair, where everything began, would have brought about a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brothers stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as its participants, had been expressed high and strong.
According to them, it is now time to allow the people to decide by the rules of direction to be taken by the country.
The Islamic project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process that should have extended until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or in court in Moubarak.
He did not do so because he shared their concept of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was shot, judged and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the World am Sontag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers has discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are fundamental violations of the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto gives him all his powers," said Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda is lagging behind, including the international community, which looks at the battle between the various political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mix of curiosity and nervousness.
That could pay for it.
A manifestor on the Thair site warns: "You will receive a monster that will no longer be able to control you."
Norway’s Racquel: Is it the most smelling fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway have one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of locals for an extremely smelling fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and salty footwear.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most captured spots.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, impregnates the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt-dried wheat and fermented in the water for a long time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to one year.
When the darkness is installed and it is cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you get a glass of water," says Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time fireman named "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people take a lot of small pieces of fish and drink a lot.
"Some people prefer the aquarium to rakfisk," Havard adds.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid putting it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi who would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk comes back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in ponds in the air, then salted in the autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well-fermented, the fish came out and - no doubt with the senses amplified by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their countries to find work, mainly from the United States.
Currently, the population is rapidly developing - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedish, their old rivers whose country was not so rich as Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Racquel is considered to be something important, a vital element, although smelling, of the past of Norway.
This is part of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not intended to deplor it.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this murder, they speak of "the incident of July 22".
The Norwegians are reluctant to accept that in their peaceful countries, one of them has been able to commit such barbaric acts.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has had its wealth in its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason that justifies our success," explains Anna, our servant, to the blonde hair and to the eyes of a transparent blue, the image of the Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk plate at hand.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like most people living here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not want to make any comment.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with much caution - all except a small percentage of money from this industry is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries threw the money through the windows, during the years that led to the international financial crisis, Norway managed to keep the lines of its well-closed stock exchange.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and make the trip in the summer, we're happy," Anna says.
"Don't forget the rakfisk," she adds in an insomniatous laugh.
I'm standing under the snow, and I'm making the dog to buy me what to eat - I've had my dose of rakfisk.
In the menu, a hamburger made of wool, a real discovery, it's excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is one of many places where we use rakfisk to eat and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most smelling of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a noud-papillon, surrounded by rakfisk seats.
We would believe in the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here's our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls out of his chair, maybe because of the water abuse.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult departure.
While President Enrique Pena Nieto is on his way to Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC, he is interested in the many challenges ahead of him and the expectations of the people.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at present.
In a city where bottlenecks are legged in normal time, a security barrier has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the objective was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential round to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is well-known for the results of the President-in-Office of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the process of a war on drugs that has already cost about 60,000 people a year.
"My Government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Pena Nieto told American President Barack Obama in the Oval Bureau a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before joining the U.S. President, Mr. Pena Nieto was Governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populous and seductive state that includes the capital. On its ground of predication, opinions on this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises are responsible for the development of tourism and infrastructure in the community.
To join the city, you can take one of M Pena Nieto's new highways, an important improvement has been made to these roads, once forested and full of grass.
A new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change have been added to its name.
"We count on him to put in place sustainable changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and the party of Mr. Pena Nieto, PRI.
In terms of security and economy, for example, we look forward to a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years without failure, PRI was avoided in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticisms of the opponents who reproach the new president for lack of charism.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great man of state and, above all, he can listen.
However, it is not always the image that the people of their former governor have.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paving streets of Valle del Bravo could not be any more flashing.
Hidden under the highways, it is, in many respects, a banner of the city of Mexico.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, soldiers were called to the rescue to fight the drug gangs in the neighborhood, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, dozens of women were murdered in the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was a governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a pitifully famous place for the number of innocent women killed there.
The detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto said that, at best, he failed to address the problem of the murders committed against women when he was in charge.
Unfortunately, they accuse his administration of refusing to see the reality in the face.
In a concrete house, typical of this decorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reported a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and body rigidity had already begun.
While his mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana wears the wall, next to a cross where the word appears: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family refused.
The authorities treated me like I was an old comedian, a troublemaker, a pleurnician.
They want us to accept what they say and stay calm.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his discharge on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new president has promised that he will make it his priority during his term of office.
"I hope that he will be as good as the president as when he was a governor," said Olvera, in Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about ill-treatment, the prosecutors said.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning would have been victimized during detention.
The trial deals with Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of having processed thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove, on Friday, that soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being the source of the greatest leak of confidential information in the entire history of the American army -- lacked many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he was supposed to have suffered during his military detention.
In an interview with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The counter-inquiry -- during a hearing, the defence filed a request that the Manning case be classified on the grounds that the sequestration took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified to his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, was accused of having processed thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
During Friday's hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that officers had completed after meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico's military prison, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked questions in Manning and gave their answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms, on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment she had reserved for her guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not state any complaints for maltreatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would take care of them, but they had not identified the problems mentioned.
"They wrote "no problem" (after having addressed the concerns), and yet that did not mean that I had not raised any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a interview in January 2011 with the Special Committee that had met to address the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to amend his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below the close monitoring for the risk of suicide -- for its protection and safety of others.
"I wanted staff to know that I was going well, and I wanted to be removed from my status... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my perspective," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he had planned to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait and had been evaporated once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he was not aware of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arajon, to this cage," said Manning, Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mattress, a cover, tongs, clothing and its glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or staying away during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning also stated that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he came back at night, they would wake him up to see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning questions about an alleged claim in his Thursday testimony -- that after having been forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stay naked in front of guards and other prisoners one morning during the call.
Manning testified that at no time, he was not allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the judge's questions, on Friday, Manning stated that he had deducted from the order of his guard that he had to throw his cover that could have hidden his nakedness, but he admitted that no one had ordered him to throw it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep the night before, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could use the elastic of his slip or his tongue to hurt himself, but that he had not done so.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
Its lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he has experienced during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is to be found guilty before a court of justice, a trial that should be held at the beginning of next year.
The defense stated that Manning was planning to charge the least serious crimes and to fight for the abandonment of other charges judged too extreme.
The hearing should be resumed this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all prisoners in Quantico.
The prosecution heads against Manning include the flight of property or public documents, the collision with the enemy, leading to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all the accused's leaders are detained, he calls for a permanent criminal trial.
My Mexican-American Identical Crisis
He says that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to blame those who are gone; they remind the Mexicans of the difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says the Mexicans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for the "Mexico" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stayed real for several seconds, not knowing which file to lead me.
I grew up in the center of California, where my name was called "Mexican" all my life.
This is an ethnic qualification, as my Boston friends use when they call themselves "Irish", or when they call themselves "Italian".
Then I became "Mexico-American".
But, here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that my grandfather was born, there was no need for special qualification or union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, enough to manage an interview in one language or another.
But I don't have an Aboriginal vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I went to the "Alterners" file.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama, House-Blanche.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their predication themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
He wants to go to the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the European Union model, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war on drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide any more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to hand over half of their territory in writing to the point of the rifle.
But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as an official U.S. makes the least criticism of Mexico, you start to hear, in the Mexican press, and among the elites, complaints about how Americans are attacking the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And Montezuma's kids are looking for the trunk.
Yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is what the country maintains with the more than 35 million Mexicans living in the United States.
Do you want us to discuss the subject of bitterness?
There's a lot of it.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not.
The only reason that explains the great number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at a given time, in our genetic tree, a person, perhaps a parent or a grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark skin, little trained, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we now live the American dream, that we went to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of that it is the American dream that we live, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree with the United States.
Moreover, we know that some of the Mexican elites in the ruling class don't like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defect and they warm us up as if we were low and not enough Mexican individuals.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves trapped on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who had legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexicans, because Mexicans are more strongly demanding their identity and the Mexicans are against it.
Although she is an American citizen, she has the feeling of being part of two countries.
In addition, many Mexican-Americans I know do not have the impression of being part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of the two worlds, but we are not rooted in either of them.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence want to get closer to Diaspora.
They want the Mexicans to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a great country that must absolutely visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And if we consider wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence that are omnipresent, many of us are not convinced that it is a fantastic country.
You're going to have to find out yourself, friends.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States in the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexicans still want them in the way that members of their families have been treated for not long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old queer, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there never be a lasting peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood transfusion seems to indicate that such hope is worthless.
While the same vain arguments persist to know who started, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time, rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be trapped in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab spring has made it quite difficult to fly into flames, and whether or not it is kept, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught by this regional turmoil.
Perhaps their fight will intensify a little more.
However, there is every reason to believe that this could help them to get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that doesn't make any losers or any winners
At first sight, it seems difficult to prove optimism.
Even if the ceasefire was granted on 21 November, the fights this week strengthened the force's participants on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has led Gaza since 2007, will have tried to force the Israelis to give up, even if Gaza has been suffocating.
Having killed some of its leaders and returned 1.7 million people from Gaza in one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently at the hands of their Fatah rivers, the other most moderate Palestinian factor.
In addition, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of the Arab world's Islamists is growing, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a strong regional power, formerly Israel's closest Muslim ally, has made and caused for Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
The members of Hamas rejoice and say that the growing Islamist runs around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the militia of Hezbollah exercises his dominion, passing through Syria, where the Islamic-tender rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of Muslim brothers under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, far from the most populous and central Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily referred to in public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor who will no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
During this time, Israel's long line participants will draw the reverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was placed in a box.
Iron Dome's baptismal missile interception system proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their two ears - for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unbreakable support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas for being the source of the last wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, particularly under the Prime Minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although Gazaese rockets have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide attacks, including through the barrier of separation on the West Bank, the main piece of what might be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish colonies that continue to spread despite their illegality in international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, of whom the Likud party merged with an even more belligerent party, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman in the approach to the election of 22 January, was in the beautiful part.
Why do these Palestinian files go down by giving them a state?
If they were leading the West Bank, wouldn't they launch rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is preferable to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they get out of their heads.
Maybe the line participants will take it; but the Arab spring may change it.
Even though the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little of Israel, their priority will be to address the problems in their own countries.
The Israeli defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local superpowers will not help the new Arab governments set up their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire that's a good hope -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder that is dedicated to exploding one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
The repression has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and democracy exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to sound Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The answer remains the one proposed by the reasonable persons on the one hand, and most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short, is that the ceasefire will give external people the opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now seek to put an end to the movement of weapons to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in line with the 1967 borders with land exchange and shared Jerusalem.
Foreign Arabs should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal of a pseudo state to the United Nations.
Mr Obama was also interested in what Israel agreed to negotiate.
During his first term of office, he did not present his own plan of peace.
Back to House-Blanche, it seems just as reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for packages of neutral cigarettes have entered into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law entered into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors were replaced by a dark olive green and horrible photos of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages since Saturday is the brand name, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the world's strictest tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% of the chances that they will never start smoking.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message of tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess."
Even though Australia records the lowest rates of smoking in the world and if these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers have stated that this would resume the black market trade, which will make it easier to access less expensive cigarettes.
"Adverse consequences will result from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, of British American Tobacco Australia.
Fascists from China and Indonesia will sell much more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others have stated that this law has dynamized their activity.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarettes, particularly in silicone, for masking the terrible packaging, has greatly increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in the high court in Australia.
He said that Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only nuance, experts say, is the popularity of the social media and the section of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsorship and the obligation for dealers to dissipate cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by local companies and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign websites from doing so.
"If you're working on tobacco marketing and you don't have more than a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the unique place by excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some lambda citizens to social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves whether this is a mere citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has given himself the trouble of making a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry went to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new decisions of justice - these countries told WHO that trade was unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
At present, these warnings are presented in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I ignore them.
"You take a cigarette and you order the package," said Victor El Hage at the time of buying a package on which a picture of mouth tumor appears.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna stop is my little girl.
James Yu, the manager of the "King of the Pack Tobaccoist" in the centre of Sydney, said that the uniformity of the packages made it difficult to arrange packages on the stands.
"Before, I needed an hour to download a package, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government had only to ban them a good time for everyone and we would have said OK, that's good, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, lifting his arms to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it may be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of the survey.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending a half-day at an airport to wait for a flight is rather boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting duty-free stores).
But more and more, some academics and experts specialized in the development of the child praise the nest.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to waste time on time, they say.
This forces the brain to borrow interesting ways or to feed creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several kinds of screens, we no longer know the benefits of the night.
So should we welcome the open-handed entourage?
Yes.
And not.
But I'll be back.
First of all, like many people, I thought that the boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The ennui goes up very far," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke the ennui, they rise in the first century.
Then there's the definition we give to the nuisance.
The problem is that John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at the York University in Ontario, Canada, has been defined and discussed in various ways.
After spending many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the year as an experience that is "to want to do something but not to get started in a satisfying activity."
The difference between the appetite of apathy, he said, is that the person is not doing a job well that she would like to do.
With the apathy, he said, there's no desire to do anything.
What is in the heart of the ennui, he said, is "the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a lousy mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
The anxiety can be very much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two can be connected, people who are having problems tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or from the world, while the depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we get to think that we're upset when it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the September newspaper "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened on cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine.
Some groups heard from the next room that it was too high for a TV show that had no reports, others just heard the TV show, and the third group didn't hear the sound.
Those who heard the TV at a low sound level said that they were more concerned than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but they did not know why, and they attributed this problem of concentration to the nuisance.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or demanding task, a interruption of attention may lead to the survey, Mark J. Fenske, an associate neuroscience professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study, said.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "like looking at objects on a mounting chain, music can help you not be upset."
In fact, he said, at present, we know that when you are tortured or are being bitten, these gestures, often considered as signs of distress, are in fact a good way to stay physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigotare learn more and hold more information than those who are forced to stay without moving," said Professor Fenske.
We are all bored one day or the other - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monochrome voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a "Pre-disposition Scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "Some of the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so many interesting centres that I don't have the time to do anything."
Using such a scale, researchers have discovered that boys tend to be more concerned than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, said, and in particular they need numerous and varied incentives.
In general, however, adolescents are quickly cursed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience in which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day through a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of adolescents would complain at school and during their homework duties, while 23 per cent would complain when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the percentages of today's birthdays, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "Adolescence is a period when the nest reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question, is it good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, to pay interest or to abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have referred to a link between the ennui and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The ennui is the way the brain found to let you know what else you should do," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the U.S.
But the brain doesn't always know what the most appropriate thing to do.
If you worry and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn to take care of himself or to become self-healed, says Professor Fenske.
And "that's legally going from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the nest.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him anymore.
To feel at ease outside of the constant booming that generates activities and technology is the goal to which we should tend.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to worry more often, but the nuisance awakens a strong and french desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate the time to stop.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directives for the new Marijuana Act
Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, studying at a college and football player in Colorado, is indicted for something that will soon become legal in his condition: possession of Marijuana bottles and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found Marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quote to compare for possession of drugs and materials that could serve his consumption - minor crimes, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he one of them?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legislate the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana were immediately classified.
Police services have stopped indicting adults aged 21 and over for the possession of marijuana minors, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative districts have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to blame those who own them.
At the same time, several cities from Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of sales of marijuana approved by the State in their neighborhoods.
"The things evolve so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of the Aurora Police, east of Denver.
The government's regulatory bodies in Washington also have no bad questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the best date on 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether it is kept or not, is in progress on most of the regulations on marijuana, first of all on the use for therapeutic purposes and now on personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith recognizes, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could rely, he said.
The Washington Act, called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, leaving a legal void of one year, during which the licensing system will still not exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
During this time, practical issues remain pending: how to balance the state's mandate that ensures proper access to the approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales in a 30 km radius around a school, a park, a playground or a crèche.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved cannabis sale trade, especially in Seattle's metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson of the Cannabis Legalization Centre, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City atorney" (representative of the public ministry) would no longer continue the 21-year-olds and more who had small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop indicting people for this kind of "immediate effect."
Chief Oates stated that the police would apply the new judicial decisions governing the activities of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, the "attorney district" (Procurator of the Republic), Ken Buck, includes a more stringent vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with Marijuana's possession cases, mainly in order to pressure users to detoxify themselves.
Currently, 119 people are accused of having 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to try to prosecute these people who committed a crime that, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence," said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were even complicated in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the limited consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer compares adults to possess limited quantities.
The representative of the county's public department, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all Marijuana detention cases immediately.
"I don't feel like losing my time to continue to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of Colorado voters supported the measure, offering a legal and government framework suitable for the personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the conflicting reactions that have been observed in various American cities highlight the profound ambience among local officials with regard to the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the public ministry, said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents people accused of using marijuana and who expresses himself as a local spokesperson of the "National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws" (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws).
"They have spent a good part of their life pursuing in justice the people who consumed marijuana, too, have the wrong to accept it as legal," he said.
As the first states to deal with the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are becoming a case of case-law for the legalization of drugs.
While the defenders and representatives of the State provide for a new legalized sales border, they look forward with concern to the federal government's directives, which always design the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of the legalization of Marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will decide.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic Marijuana and sellers, the federal government has mainly allowed marijuana sales to be carried out in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
If it is true that the police are probably not going to sink the doors to grab small drug bags, there is strong evidence that it is opposed to the approved sale of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser of the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado did not expect federal authorities to act.
Before the polls, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales, even if this was only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a 6-month moratorium, and should impose this ban next week.
"We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than in the vote of the State.
Many questions are raised.
Petronella Wyatt: I was abused and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservatory).
These are not just today's students who are attacked for their opinions.
So far as I remember, I've always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in what was an excellent place for me to know, a kind of Greek amphitheater of modern times that stimulates both pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I was installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal in my life.
My father fell apart and started crying.
My friends were disappointed.
L'Evenning Standard's newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that first-cycle students had sexual relations in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said with pleasure that I was part of after being forced to drink at broken rates.
The truth was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yeah, I ran away because I was a victim of harassment and made the subject of constant brilliance.
Not because of my name, not because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this so-called berth, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my sorry father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was partisan of the Conservative Party.
Why do you say that today, you'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of right-wing students suffers the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford was such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights as those of gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the student hall (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College stated that they were "always isolated, attacked personally and felt undesirable" because of their political views.
They want to have a representative in the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary released on BBC Two "Wunderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Country of Wonders: Young, Intelligent and Right"), devoted to the politics of students, and which portrayed the "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-nazis.
Among other things, the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moves to Rolls-Royce, takes a completely silvered tree and moves with a chromed cane.
In other universities, conservative students say to be treated as emission gaps in the introduction of higher school costs."
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association", said a Sunday newspaper "that there is a left-wing party in universities.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old student in history at Corpus Christi, who proposed a more protection movement, said that such a climate was "uncomfortable", and 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president of the OCA, said that there was a deterioration in the attitude of members of the JCR towards people who are centre-rights.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate and to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think about it during my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered September 1986, when I was 18 years of age and a paralysing shyness.
The conservative party's hatred was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted for the refusal to agree to Margaret Thatcher - an old student - an honorary title, due to the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinic vibrations.
From the first days of the reception week, when the new students became acquainted with the others and the teachers, I had a taste for what was going to happen next.
I found that teachers not only participated in sarcasm with the Tory students, but they also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on gross minors, the privatization and opposition of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was recorded in the wood of classrooms.
The first sarcasm that I was the victim of was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared there.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a lousy face, took it easy.
"Is it that the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laugh.
The tears were burning my eyes.
"I suggest you take French courses during your free time - at last, if you're not too busy making friends," he started out with a bit of anger.
I'm back in my room, inconsolable.
During dinner tonight, I sat alone and then I felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OCA.
"I know who you are," he said, politely.
I'm really afraid he'll do that.
Everyone suspected of being a Tory (conservator) is taken for target.
It's hard enough for me already, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most Tory youths claim to be workers.
Later, in the local pub, I tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
This strategy has failed.
A first year student of philosophy, political and economic sciences who had ironically studied in Eton said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students picked up the refraction.
I was a pervert, man.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I just live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet people sharing the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I have become a Labourer and reinstate my opinions?
The next three years would be like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only open professor Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught in my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was a consultant in foreign policy of Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his accession to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a position as a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to make the shuttle between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and friends more open to mind.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was incredible.
During his studies in Oxford, in the forty years, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreams.
Even my Communist friends had irrevocable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I'm sure it's to touch you.
That would break my heart if you left Oxford.
I was tired of my frequent trips to London, and my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
During the next week's work session, when another history professor suggested the world's most serious, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do so.
I was deeply ashamed to be the victim of the brainwashing of my parents and the treatment of "old fools".
The repeat was short-lived.
It's my father who's buried the last cloud of my Oxford circle.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed carpeted in my room, and after five minutes, my persecutors left.
When they left, I made my suitcase and took the first train for London.
I've never been back.
You can treat me with pleurnichard wet chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such intimidation in a school institution.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 first ministers of Tory, but also benefited from an unmistakable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety "
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", opened this week in London, ABC questioned Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian Courier.
Somereset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital to welcome an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The cook recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective that gathers more than 130 models of high Couture created for his cooking home in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the starting point of a story whose only protagonist is "the Signor" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its famous customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, there is an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the aristocracy cream, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from the modest cousin of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet set.
There's nothing wrong with loving the kingdom.
"At least, they don't burn their cigarettes on your beautiful carpet as some pop music stars do," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his Gstaad chalet," explains the former woman of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of ancient beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentine model
The Argentine Mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charm of the cook.
A few years ago, after a show on the Place of Spain, in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," recalled the "top model", who began working with him during the week of the High-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never go fashion, for its creations are works of art," she said.
Nobelsse line stripe
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but shared love.
He loves the very high people and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a six-metre-wide glamour podium that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and has to parade on the podium to admire a "public" dream bringing the main creations of Valentino, such as the size that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage with Aristote Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "La Night", or a wool and fur hat belonging to the Emperor Farah Diba.
Among this public of mannequins are names such as Sybile de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the cook in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first Valentine's clothes are like the first love, "unforgettable to forget".
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a "gilette" and a dress from the 1971-1972 autumn collection.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the curator's museums.
"I prefer him to everyone else for his femininity, his great love for women, and because he exalts our beauty," adds the former Duke of Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and they shine the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashionist Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg can no longer forget the first time she brought a Valentine model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening clothes...
Finally, it was possible at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first model Valentine for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a flying jacket, a draped pocket and a drop-out.
"It was a dream that became a reality," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with impermeable," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg retains the dress of the cook's evening with "the greatest care, because a dress of the evening is not only a dress, it is also all the memories she carries."
The "king" of fashion
The great end of the exhibition of Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress with Paul de Grece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (the knifer calls his shirts) to make this silky dress with pearl incrustments, twelve different types of teeth and a four-metre and a half-metre stretch.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high cost of the late 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obtained for years by the "know-how" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavalier di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavalier del Laboro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated by the Legion d'honeur, Garavani collects as many honors as any of his clients' wives.
"It's refined, its calm, its well-being and perfect look have always missed me," says Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"It was impeccable, the years had no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says...
The world's hardest job: the human dead of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilograms of sulphur through the steep stone roads.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their lives by bringing the sulphur of the Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas emanating from the ground floor is solidified in air contact.
After collecting large sulphur rocks, which weigh almost 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo panels that he loads on his shoulders through the steep roads.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano that climbs to 2,386 metres high, but the exhausted carriers put more than 40 minutes to burn this distance, at a pitch of tortue, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so that they do not stumble and fall into the precipitation.
They know that a mistake could not cost them their lives, as this happened to a French tourist who fell deadly in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The Kawah Ijen minors earn 5 cents of euros for each kilo of extracted sulphur.
Once at the top, a path broke between tourists who photographed them as if they were circus bees, and carrying painfully heavy banners, they march the 3 km to the balance that a mining company installed a little counter to 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has operated the volcano since 1960, and it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian clothes (5 cents of euro) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry as this miner is very present in everyday life and is used to manufacture candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whitewash sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 clothes (€3,8) each trip," explains Anto, who generally makes three trips per day.
Each takes 3 hours and ends exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138 000 clothes (€11.50) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such an overhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would gain in the fields.
"The income of the minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees per day (EUR 1.20) and where the monthly average wage is two million rupees (167)", says the carrier who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees per day (€6.20) and the job was not so difficult, but Anton returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason which, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as suffering: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java for her conversion to Islam".
Then he suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, he spent three of his life exposing the danger on the Kawah lichen, but the sufferer had already begun to make him pay the bill even though he covered his face with a mask and wore special gloves.
And he suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughing, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to continue his dream.
"I'm going to work for two more years, because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in a more acceptable English.
Tragedy by life, this nice and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an insanity of wood with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning, because the sourness does not stop at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and bright in the middle of darkness.
Defending the darkness, Ando went down to the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp fixed to his helmet, that he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers charge the blues on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their behalf and are paid to the weight.
Moreover, they do not touch any more of the 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.50) of the increase by photo equipment, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.20), that the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
He can carry up to 110 pounds, he ensures he won't stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sufferer damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors in the lungs of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so stubborn that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... that obviously add their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the pancreas.
By balancing the basket on its back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only charge 50 pounds.
Every day, his companions and they extract 15 tons of volcanic sulphur, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometres from there through a path of goats invaded by the bad herbs.
"I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is all my life," Unainik says by opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The daughter of her five children, 30 years of age, also works as a sufferer.
Time passes, but the perpetuity of generation is one of the most difficult occupations in the world: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah Ljenk volcano.
Singapore Baby Search to Save the Economy
Singaporeans assume responsibility for this absence of children on the career, stress and the cost of access to property.
"The people of Singapore must develop."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, we fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unmistakable that these words came from advertising for pastils at menthe, but despite this, or perhaps thanks to this, the video spread as a powder slide on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polychinella in the shooter" to wet Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency from the source of the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way through this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music to enable people to fulfill their "national duty".
It is intended only for the Internet, so we have been able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we feel that it was a theme we should address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we are saying the following: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
It spends $1,300 a year in politics to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservativeism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered to be the rate of renewal, was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the marriage and family policies of the National Population Division, states that it was due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life and priorities, beyond marriage and the formation of a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the decline of the population has created a sense in the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites that provide a rather derogated xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against Chinese people who are accused of lowering wages and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore has experienced its worst electoral results last year since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the drop in birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as a shoebox, which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage the promoters who want to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, claims that its "shoes" sells much faster than the larger housings.
They are more popular, in the sense that these housings are built much faster than those of larger size.
That's why it's much more profitable for our treasure.
However, he admitted that the new standards provided clearer instructions to the promoters, who had previously been put in the wheels if they wanted to offer too little housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre, it would seem that they are not going to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, like education, so that's why people send it back later," says a young framework.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it is important to be able to have my money and my time," another 20-year-old tells us.
Men and women mention their career, stress and the cost of access to property and education as reasons for preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babysitting, it is Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private online is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the field of private life which we can protect from any intrusion".
What does this involve in the private sector for at least 16 years?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he exposes by spreading on the Internet of events that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper ElPeriodico interviewed five young boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four cases, they have associated the term "something very personal" on the personal level and "the password and user name" when applying it to social networks.
"I will not disclose my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them, but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I won't share one of my photos or anyone who would make the imbecile," he says.
The young boy recognized that it was wrong to publish obscenity photos, innocent people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine subscribers on Twitter.
Most of them are family.
In part, her mother knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
"The social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends quickly," he said.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He will not trust anyone who would recommend a foreigner.
The case of José, aged 14, is different.
The adolescent has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"This doesn't bother me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made any advances or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I'd just delete it from my account," he admits.
José joined Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today under the name of cyberharkaretly are not foreign to the young boy.
A close friend of mine was hacked into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was" he assured him.
The victim, according to José, didn't close his account.
"He only passed it in a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post knowledge photos in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I were angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cyberharcement," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, professor of English and licensed in Education and Learning, considers that, in order to guide children and adolescents, the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information, but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras reports that the academic Marc Prensky, who has a master in education at Yale University and author of the book "Natifs and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, they are children and young people born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves," she said.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what to disclose, publish or say at an age where they do not have the maturity required to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences" she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach child and adolescent confidentiality is to use questions that make them reflective.
"They say that they don't do it at all," she says.
Then, Porras cites a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a photo of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you identify photos of parties, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every minute?
Another point is to make them understand that they should act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"On the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, that must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Esturdo Guardia, university professor, primary institute and education adviser, states that it is essential for parents to read the conditions of use of social networks consciously.
By including each term, they will have solid bases to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published," he said.
According to the Guardian, it is essential to remind the children not to speak to strangers.
The Unasur Summit ended without the publication of the Lima Declaration
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) has now ended in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 current mandates.
Efé tried several times to access the document signed at the Sixth Regular Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency reported on the start that it would be disclosed after the summit was closed, and then claimed that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian Government's website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The few information circulating among journalists was given by the press of some of the Governments of the Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the day was the list of the present presidents, which caused a certain malaise among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who claimed more important information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not of the official document that concluded the summit.
In October, Peru was hosting the 3rd Summit in South America (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although this was requested by the press, it did not issue the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA site, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited the availability of information to a maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court which concluded a different border between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met at the regional meeting and stated that they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear the complainants from both sides in the trial that Lima had attempted against Santiago and which began Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are bringing to this international court today," said President Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
"Cali has always been, and will continue to be a respectable country of international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," President Pinyra added, giving President Humala a handhold, alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia this week denounced the Bogotá Covenant by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended by Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The Mandate read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been established among South American countries for a total of $17 million of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of the United States would put in place "significant steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of residence permits agreements".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve drug accessibility, access to the Internet at low prices throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a crisis Europe, "Economic consolidation (from Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix, but must help to increase our productive matrix and bring about a better future for our populations," said President Humala.
"We have decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, particularly in rural and border areas ... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the President of Peru during a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were about Peru and were on the cross-sectional axis of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a more important connection with Ecuador although it did not give any more details.
The final document also mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of the South American Nations", which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a judgment of the IGC requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua, which will call for a discussion with this country," he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," President Santos added.
The Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they planned to attend the presidency of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the framework of the summit, the bloc's Defence Ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," said Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today said that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should be an example of Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the Sixth Summit of the South American Union (Unasur), located in Lima, told state TV, Peru, that Europeans "were interviewed during the Second World War" and other conflicts, "but they were now almost a homeland."
In this regard, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the countries members of the Unasur.
"There must be free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still areas of reaction that we want to make to belong to the past" he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President showed support for the reconstruction of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, referring to Ecuador's political asylum to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, for he has not betrayed his own principles, but has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that its trial would not be respected".
In addition, he criticised the Swedish justice who demanded that he submit to an interrogation on a alleged sexual offence in his territory, while "Swedish legislation allows it to be done by videoconference, which could have been done since the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the embassy informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian President.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being trapped in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"This is about the health of anyone," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the equatorial Embassy of London, which would be the award of a save conduct that would allow it to go to Ecuador, is between the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and he stresses that there has been discussions in London in order to find a solution to the problem of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures with various European authorities," he said.
And he thinks, "If Britain had given up the free conduct in the morning, that would have ended."
And if Sweden, as its legislation permits it, and as it has already done in other cases, would question Mr. Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or would question him through Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm herself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he would not tolerate was "the mediocrit, the evil faith and the lies that harm freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of the freedom of the press are not evil or perverse politicians, but bad journalists at the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he welcomed the fact that this is not the kind of journalist "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward its re-election, "it would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and follow the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain a veto on Paraguay in the United States until at least the next elections, arguing that the organization "should stand firm and not tolerate the opportunism and attempted coup d'état", because in reality "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Furthermore, the Ecuadorian President considers it "perfectly relevant" to the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgement of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
For the time being, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to advance together.
They need to be solved together to get over them and get ahead of them.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the good resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders that opposes Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it is "beneficial for Latin America to seize the international courts if both countries agree to accept such a firm judgement as it may be".
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to challenge a third mandate, he noted that he saw this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Korea has ensured that, if it lost its prime minister in February 2013, it would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved by means of political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last presidential mandate and I will then withdraw from political life.
If we never forgive us, I will, too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just discussed with the Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a rejection of President Chavez's health status," he commented.
The Heads of State of Ecuador today participated in Lima in the VIe summit of Heads of State and Government of the South American Union (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
The AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the test was confirmed: seropositive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "the least painful", in vain.
The young man hid it in his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it and his opinion was so that he just celebrated his 43rd anniversary.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he met in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the virus of human immunodeficiency (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, where there was much doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigmatization.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying to him "because he was without a voice."
At that time, having the AIDS was a synonym for death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, despite their disease, many still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "expulsive" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said HCG's HIV unit chief Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he takes the view that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of administration of the immune system that patients had at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who did not use drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reached a rate of 500 CD4.
Simply speaking, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, "as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems until 75 years of age", the researcher explained.
In order to replace this progress in its context, we need to know that the Mexicans' life expectancy is today on average 76 years.
If it is true that mortality has significantly decreased in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS has increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national database have died.
Nothing that in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there any more deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's what I see, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years, we've never lacked medication, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they don't know they're infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine patients on ten arrive while they already have an opportunistic infection, which is necessary to have a greater impact on overall mortality, it is to carry out earlier diagnostics and, for this, it is necessary to propose mass testing tests to all persons who are applying for it."
Specialists and members of the Council of State for the Prevention of AIDS of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do their screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done so and that, despite his youth, he was already a carrier of AIDS and suffered from the sarcoma of Kaposi, a cancer tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better that I wake up three times a week," they say, it's not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I do exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents know only that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of the World Day against AIDS.
If they do the test, if they take risks, they will know sooner if they are seropositive and better that will be, and if they already have the diagnostic, they need to know that you can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Preservatives on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist in Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are giving them hundreds of packages, it is very good, but as a result, today, some still do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do?", posed with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents don't want to hear, ensure the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be sold to the counters, but that they be found in the distributors of public toilets and in the places where young people attend.
This is not about encouraging promiscuity.
It is no longer about paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had answered when he was asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, it is best to provide condoms to those already sexually active," he stressed.
The figures in Jalisco
13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in the number of new cases and cases accumulated from AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of the contaminants are sexual, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, as there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it for each recorded case.
A judgment ratified in appeal by a U.S. tribunal ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario creates a negative precedent for all national corporations with branch offices in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
It would therefore appear that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country at the star banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the trial rendered on June 15th by Judge Harlin Hale of the North District of Texas bankruptcy court leaves Mexican companies without defence against the possibility of joining their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main glass manufacturer of Mexico to enter the United States Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case indicates that creditors must register under the United States bankruptcy law, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, sitting in New Orleans, claims that the main proceedings are the formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would be to denounce the cooperation of international proceedings in cases of insolvency of undertakings with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Trade Law had been established for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-society vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro's subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not be obtained.
However, the Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
There are about half a dozen examples here, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, including the Federal Institute of Commercial Fallites.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since there remained the votes of the subsidiaries, in all ways the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, i.e. the "voucher" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes against 37.
A data omitted from the court of appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has faced since 2008 without stopping from the serious economic crisis facing the United States, which has cost the country.
For the moment, the González Sada's family will intervene in the same appeal court so that the vote will take place in its entirety, that is to say with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The appeal of assurance will call for non-principality and requires a review of the trial by a superior body, in which case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States of America.
The most serious thing is that the court has ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the curiae friend ("friend of the Court") in which Vitro detailed the procedure under the Trade Faults Act, indicating that it would free him from the conventions signed by the two countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Faults Act.
He also noted that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Carabolage of two parts: they absorb Vitro and they absorb the country.
General budget
The complaints from the unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former boss of the company, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, have been brought to silence for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, and the Association of Air Pilots has already encountered problems.
The case, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and the Values that is accused of obstruction to justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically refused to provide information to the Attorney-General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the F/589 fide commission from Bank IXE 198 million weights on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used to purchase actions from the Professional Office of Hotels.
As everyone knows, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're watching Dragon Mart.
A group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and civil society members at an amphitheater at the University of the Caribbean, approved the creation of a broad opposition front to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal center of sale and distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean products of the large wall country, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the South-East area in order to oppose the monumental project that is in part on protected areas and represents the largest of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
The Government has put forward a request by the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the ambassador of Mexico to Japan had signed the Trade Anti-Conference Agreement, known as ACTA's English-language, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already of ancient history.
As everyone knows, it has been well done that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, because it was considered a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term homex
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting them in the short-term, the real estate promoter Homex launched on the stock exchange market for 500 million weights.
This issue of securities is the first of the four issues for which they propose to pay interest every 28 days.
Competitive Birth
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet companies, IT leaders, a new consortium that has a social reason for competition has just been born, whose goal will be the market for software clustering in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is my whole life"
The "Hetin" Reyes basketball world winner spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the ground and, thanks to him, travelled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as big as the Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before brain hemorrhage does not condemn him in the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for over 60 years, whether he is a player of lower leagues, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I carried several helmets in the basketball all my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, director general of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalls at a visit from Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball is my whole life."
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind him of his journey out of standard, testify to it.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he most affects are those who remind him of his passage as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s to 1982, after having spent 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
"That was my best years, the ones I've enjoyed most because I've had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros Championships since 1967, whether as a manager, co-manager or a leader.
This has taken many years of satisfaction, including the five championships fought from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the 1981 championship, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the head of the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been in charge here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a player that costs you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it?"
It's like it started with Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another one.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros Championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since he was already the great leader of the federation in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his duties and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us replay the last match, Reyes said.
The 1990 World Team is the best national team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as was the one who beat the Dream Team during the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is that of the Cuban Pan-American Games in 1991, when we won gold and we brought it to the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that had won the bronze during World War II.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Qujote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the 90th world because of a knee problem.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruiter in exchange for the players suspended by the Imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt it's Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as did Picculín.
And that doesn't take into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work that Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
It was part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season at the beginning of the 1990s.
What are you still doing?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as regionalization of the categories of minors.
For example, Ponce's boys play only in their area and face only teams from the other corners of the island during national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when this is not necessarily necessary.
At least I have seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and arbitrators.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch the clips of my time on YouTube, I enjoy my little kids and, from time to time, I attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been on my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth (Texas), was known worldwide for the main role of John Ross Ewing, best known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he had a man of business with no scruples, rerouting and manipulation.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnet without screw J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year in J.R's role in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday night of complications of a cancer, according to a family communiqué sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his dear home town of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved the most," said the family.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas today's Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who interpreted his wife's role in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, reported his press attack, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived a deep life," Gray said in a communiqué.
The doctors had diagnosed a liver cirrhosis in Larry Hagman in 1992 and had recognized that he had had a lot of beer for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver, and he had a seizure.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had become familiar with television in the role of an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by the NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought it back to him.
He also played in two comedys that have remained for some time in the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among its roles in the cinema are the roles well received by the critic in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterly interpretation of the deliciously disgusting J.R. that Larry Hagman knew his greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their neighbors were broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to hold the suspension around a full episode of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in pairs.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record of hearing at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made Dallas the second most-looked entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s beautiful sister, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot him.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to attack her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and unsatisfiable man but at charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and a unfaithful wife who tried to get her alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "What about the honor of citizens J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, a co-protagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as a man "great, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each one of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were distributed a few months ago with a great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is in progress, the chain has been informed.
For the moment, neither the Warner nor the TNT chain communicated how the Hague death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who is familiar with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her the day in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the scene of the New York theatres in the early 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
That's where he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where they live with many celebrities.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (French: Hello Darlin': J.R's impotable memoirs)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or hurt him in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver arrest, he became an active organ donor and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist the troubled patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come to work and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them some comfort, like "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it'll be okay."
He has also been fighting tobacco and has participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate heating.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing an irresistable hammer there: the end of the "great set" of the Maya calendar on December 21, to which many refer as proof of the end of the coming world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax haven that some have named "the Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of time thought that the apocalypse would be triggered.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé to his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we report it, it was a very good time.
And remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will be in theory the last of history.
At Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vucker graduated from the "Media, Culture and the End of the World" course.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate heating.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could explode.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared to examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vucker said.
On the main campus of the University of State of Pennsylvania, the professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of History of Art and Anthropology, have teamed up to give a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world would not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "present disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the watch of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students with any choice but to work "until the night of the end of the supposed world," said Restal.
Courses have become quite popular.
"It was completed in two hours," said Restal about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who were asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It impresses me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Infirmary, claims to have seen all the apocalypse films.
"I've never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, and even less a teacher, told us to believe in the end of the world on 21 December.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy, and in some way we discredited it," says Julie Zegle, a last-year student in Temple, aged 21 and from West Chester.
Mayas never foretold the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restal.
But I agree that there is anxiety about apocalypse in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an escalation of these speculations.
"In other places in the world, people don't think about it," he says.
It's mostly the Anglophone world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who gave courses to the Philippines this year, responded quickly when he was asked if he knew that there were courses here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a thank you from the Pope.
Restal points out that over the years, many dates of the last judgment have been mentioned, and he states that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will start to think immediately about the next date" or philosopher on the fact that on 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several told us that they were thinking about going to parties "of the end of the world".
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old in communications student.
