Members of the Valuing Congregation are concerned that they are ‘like Mupetka’
Some members of the congregation are threatened with the proposal to be appointed MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, etc.) after a new term.
This was due to plans to change the name of the congregation to the Valianian Parliament.
Members of the whole political group are worried about smiling.
A member of the congregation of the types of laborers said that they were cared for in their group, “which is the name of the Rhyme with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside of Wales: in the vald of Twp means a trap, and a pwp to pop.
A member of the congregation in Plaid Cymru said that their group as a whole was "not satisfied", and proposed other options.
The Valiant Conservative said that his group 'open spirit' was a change of name, while noting that between the words MWP and Muppet there was a small difference in the statement.
In this context, the expression ‘w’ is similar to the expression ‘u’ in the Irish word.
The Commission, which is currently preparing a draft legislation for the presentation of amendments to the name, said: 'The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the congregation will of course have to be adopted by members themselves'.
By law, the Valižan Congregation has been given the authority to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Valianian Parliament.
For members of the congregation, the Commission chose the name ‘Welsh Parliament Member’ or ‘WMP’, but in public consultation, the most support was given the option ‘MWP’.
Members of the congregation obviously propose other options, but reaching consensus will be a difficult task for President Elin Jones, who has to present a draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will also include other changes in the way the congregation operates, including rules on the incompatibility of the functions of members of the congregation and the formation of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will participate in the legislative debate in the final vote on their appointment.
Macedonians will decide with the referendum to change the name of the country
The voters will vote on a Sunday to change the name of their country to 'North Macedonia'.
They wish to resolve a ten-year dispute with the neighboring Greece, whose province is Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbours represents the right to their territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for membership in the EU and Nata.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not take the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including the President of Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in the name is the only price they have to pay for joining the EU and Nata.
The bells in the church of St. Martin’s have been silenced because the churches in Harlem are facing problems
“The older people I was talking to say that they used to be bars and churches on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today no one else.”
He explained that the disappearance of the bar was understandable.
“People are getting together today differently.
The bars are no longer a living room, where people start regularly.”
In churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that soon they will be back in the beginning.
He added that the churches could replace the buildings with the common administration (condominium) where they would live people who would not help shelters in the neighborhood that remained.
“Many people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and that is why the day will soon come when all these churches will be closed, as it is unlikely that people who move to these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built the white religion community before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s decade later.
The first white Methodist Church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the black religious community, which served as a temple in the vicinity.
St. Martin’s took over the black religious community under the leadership of Honorary John Howard Johnson, who was on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led a boycott of sellers who did not want to hire or support blacksmiths.
The fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but when the parishioners planned to rebuild Johnson’s house, they ordered bells to run.
To honor David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in the church of St. Martin’s, the bells were proudly called “the bells for poor people”.
The expert in July called them a little different: ‘cultural stock’ and ‘unreplaceable historical instrument’.
Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first bells to be played by a dark-haired musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to the Church of Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he was knocking on larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said that he was not replaced by St. Martin’s church.
In the Church of St. Martin’s, a complicated story has been held over the past few months with architects and contractors; some have been brought by church newspapers and others by the bishops.
Zacristija – the administrative organ of the parish, composed of the times – wrote to the bishop in July that she was concerned that the bishop would “try to carry the costs” to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the cabinet.
Sea dog injured a 13-year-old during the hunting of lobsters in California
Officials report that on Saturday in California, a sea dog was attacked and injured by a 13-year-old during the hunting of lobsters during the opening of the lobster hunting season.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. in the vicinity of the beach Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the TV KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning, about half an hour he drowned with friends when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then with the group he sailed to him and helped him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that first he thought the boy was just excited because he caught the lobster, and then he realized that he was shouting "He bit me!
He bit me!"
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed he had a broken whole key.
“I’ve convinced everyone to get out of the water: “In the water is a sea dog!” he added.
The boy was transferred with a helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The species of a sea dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
The water rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press statement that a few weeks earlier, in this area, they noticed a sea dog, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe damage to the upper part of the body.
In 48 hours, the responsible were denied access from the beach Ponto Beach in Casablanca to the beach Swami’s in Ecinitas for investigation and security.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of marine dogs in this area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes in Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with beautiful corners, as they have in the lobbys, and with professional staff.
As part of the British beauty market that is worth GBP 2.8 billion and is still growing, while selling clothing and household appliances falls, more beauty points will be tested in 11 state-owned stores, and the next year in more markets if they prove to be successful.
They have decided to invest in beautiful products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill out policies that have previously been used for television, microwaves and household appliances.
With Sainsbury’s, they say they will double the offer of their beauty products to 3,000 products and also include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing offer of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have more space in areas with trademarks similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also revitalizes its retail offer of cosmetic products, so that most vegan products – something that younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury’s shops. The first week last opened in Croydon in southern London, and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham by the end of the year.
Due to the online purchase and daily purchase of smaller quantities of food in local stores, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, Executive Director at Sainsbury’s, said that retail trades would be similar to the benefactors because the supermarket chain is trying to fight the discount of Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-animal products.
Sainsbury’s group has opened outlets of Argos in more than a hundred shops and also Habitat shops since it bought both chains two years ago, which has increased the sales of food, and the takeovers have been more profitable.
The previous Supermarket attempts to renew their departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products have failed.
Sainsbury’s was a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 21st century, but the link ended after a dispute regarding the sharing of drug profits in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s three years ago for GBP 125 million sold its pharmaceutical company to Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy.
They stated that Lloyds would play a role in this plan, because in four stores they would extend the offer of luxury brands for skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the appearance and impression of our beautiful corners and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will be available for advice.
Our brand offer is designed to meet all needs, attractive environments and convenient locations, and means that we are now an interesting destination, which is a challenge for the old way of buying."
Peter Jones 's angry 'cause Holly Willoughby got away from work worth 11 million pounds.
The star plays Dragons Day (Good Business) angry because Holly Willoughby's television director left his job, worth 11 million pounds, with his brand of lifestyle to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand clothes and Truly supplements.
The company was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The director of this Morning, 37, has announced on Instagram that he's gone.
Holly Willoughby was angry with the Dragons Dan Petra Jones, as she recently withdrew from their lucrative business with a trademark of the lifestyle to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Viri says that Jones was "suffered" when a golden girl on Tuesday during a tight meeting at his Marlow's headquarters in Buckinghamshire admitted that due to her new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – there is no time to devote their brand to clothing and accessories Truly.
The company compared with the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and announced that it would double its assets estimated at GBP 11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly's trademark, Jones fled from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source says: "Truly was far the most important thing for Holly.
It would be her long-term future to survive the next two decades.
Her decision to leave completely confused all involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was going on, because the opening was so close.
At the company’s headquarters in Marlow, the warehouse is full of goods prepared for sale.’
Experts believe that this Morning, which is one of the most interesting links for banks in Britain, would be the departure of the head of the company because of large investments in products, from furniture and candle to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
Moreover, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were a good friend of ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby has established True with Cappov in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
In addition, Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m A Celebrity's ITV.
The source near Jones last night said, "We won't comment on his business."
A difficult conversation “and then we fell in love”
He complained about the criticisms of the media on the basis of a comment that some feel to be “unpresidency” and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up like that?
The trumpet, with its smiling “newer” voice, said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He stressed that Kim showed interest in the second meeting. Her first meeting in Singapore in June marked Trump as a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see the "response" of the previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead of this, the U.S. continues to be subject to sanctions that continue to exert pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his argument.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
But now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had led to positive results – they stopped testing rockets, helped free hostages and brought home the post-mortem remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
"It can be very Presidential, but instead of 10,000 people outside who are trying to get to this site full view, we have 200 people standing here," Trump said and showed the crowd directly to himself.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island, more than a hundred dead
For example, the removal of the effects of the earthquake in Lombok has been told to non-governmental organisations that they do not need their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok have been displaced, natural disasters have not been reported, which is the condition for sending international aid.
“In many cases, it was very clear that they did not require international aid, so the situation was somewhat complicated,” Sumbun said.
The Save the Children is a team that will travel to Pala, but it is not yet clear if foreign personnel can help.
Sutopu, a representative of the National Disasters Agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu and determining whether they would allow international agencies to help.
Given that the quakes in Indonesia are permanent, the state remains completely unprepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceha they built shelters after tsunami, but on other sides this is not common practice.
When life was lost, the apparent absence of a warning siren for the tsunamis in Palu was likely contributed, although the warning was in force.
Traveling among many Indonesian islands is also a challenge in the best possible time.
Because of natural disasters, logistics is even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is to assist victims of the earthquake in Lombok, is floating against Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put the improvement of destroyed Indonesian infrastructure ahead of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit is a problem for the Jokov administration in re-election next year.
Yoko is also faced with the pressure of long-term tensions among the sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and more than ten thousand were evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim troops fought on the streets with swords, bows, and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge scored for late settlement against Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool in 89 minutes before defeating Chelsea in the English League.
Sturridge has accepted the offer of a 25-metre Jherdana Shaqirija in front of Chelsea's goal while remaining his team 1-0.
He gave the ball to his left and shot at the remote door.
The arrow traveled high above the criminal space against the right upper corner of the neck.
The ball finally went down through the door of Cape Arrizabalage and went down.
“I’ve just tried to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq, always pulling it as far as I can, so I’ve only tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I didn't think much more and I just decided to shoot."
Chelsea led the 1-0 half-time with the Belgian player Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
In this action, the Blue Attacker turned the ball back to Mateu Kovacic and fled to Liverpool in half.
He snuck in the middle quickly and went on.
Then he gave it through the defense and Hazard fled to the prison.
Hazard was in the middle of an emergency, and with his left leg shot at the remote gate through Liverpool's Alison Becker's door.
Liverpool will meet Naples in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, in the group part of the League of Champions.
Chelsea is waiting for videoton in the League of Europe on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, and the state accident agency reported on Sunday morning.
The representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told the press conference that there were many people due to the Friday earthquake of 7.5, which triggered six-metre waves captured in the ruins of buildings.
The palace, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is surrounded by ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for murder after a woman was stabbed to death
The police launched a murder investigation after they found a woman's body in Birkenhead in Merseysid this morning.
A 44-year-old with stab wounds was found at 7.55 in Grayson Mews building on John Street Street and arrested a 32-year-old man for murder.

I also invite all, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on camera footage to get in touch with us, because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
The police representative confirmed that the woman was Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon the crime scene was attended by friends who thought they knew a woman and asked where they found her in the morning.
The investigation is under way, but the police inform the women's own.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.

Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the most recent memory target of the dispute about "rewriting history"
Its removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical proponents of puritanism.
But Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal "incredulity" and "try to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In today's debate on the removal of the statues, it has become clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the West Minister's palace will become a target."
An iconoclassism in the English Civil Wars Cromwell did not even execute orders.
Maybe for the actions of his predecessor of the past century, he's gonna be a victim of the wrong Cromwell.
The great presentation by Cromwell, prepared by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a 19th-century opinion and is part of a history of personality that some think is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell's numerous (maybe more later in the 19th century than today) are seen as a protector of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
But it's a very accurate presentation, it's the subject of continuous historical discussions.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the further development of our people, and Cromwell is recognized as an individual representing one side of this division.
His achievements from the time he was Lord's protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
Killer pig slaughtered by a Chinese farmer to death
After reporting local media, the Chinese pig attacked and killed the farmer at the market in the southwestern China.
The man who was identified only with the reception of “Yuan”, found a dead man with a cut artery and covered with blood near a pig in a market in the town of Liupanshu in the province of Guizhou, reported on Sunday at the South China Morning Post.
The pig breed is being prepared for the vaccination of pigs on the pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
After the report, the brother and sister were supposed to come in from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big pig's male in the pig's pig's ass.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig had killed the farmer to death.
“British feet were bloody and embellished,” the cousin with the title “Wu” quoted in the Guiyang Evening News magazine.
The security footage showed that Yuang came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousins.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pigs were closed so that they wouldn't attack anyone else while the police were collecting evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and market leadership are supposed to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of swine attacks have been reported.
In 2016 the pig attacked the woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, with men suffering severe bodily injury.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig pressed the Valiant village at the tractor, but then the woman took the animal away.
After the pigs had eaten a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba for CBC News said that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “injector”.
"We'd just play.
They're like little children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
They just need to show them enough respect," he said.
On the south-west of the United States due to the remnants of the Rosa hurricane coming heavy rains
According to predictions, Orkan Rosa moves against the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and the weak.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floodwaters to the north of Mexico and the southwestern United States.
From Sunday from 5.00 a.m. in the morning after the east time, the rose is category 1 with wind speed 137 km/h and is located 620 kilometres south-west of Punta Eugenie in Mexico.
She's expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, above the Pacific Ocean, the area of low air pressure is strengthened, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm and will push a high tropical humidity against the north to the south-west of the United States.
Rose will bring up to 250 mm of rain in the parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, a tropical moisture mixed with low air pressure will create massive falls in the wider south-west area in the coming days.
Locally, from 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, flooding and the possibility of land use in the desert.
Due to high tropical moisture, the amount of rainfall in some towns will be approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west parts, above most of Arizona, a drop of between 50 and 100 mm is expected.
Floods are possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the widespread nature of the tropical rain.
A very thoughtless foot would be taken to the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Strong rains can turn cannons into riverbeds, but storms will bring local winds and dust into the air.
Near the area of low air pressure will bring local rains to the south coast of California.
It is possible to fall more than 12 mm, which may result in a smaller drop in the tide and the collapsible road.
This will be the first rains for the region during the rainy period.
Some scattered tropical fleets will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday afternoons and Mondays early in the morning, late Mondays and Tuesdays will spread.
The mighty rain will spread across the sky on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In the United States, October can reach large temperatures, as the Arctic is cooling, and tropical regions remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in the temperature at short distances.
The week is an excellent example of the dramatic difference in temperature in the central part of the United States.
Between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaho in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, there are 20 degrees of difference.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to set up and expand again.
Most of the Central and Eastern United States will enter the heat of October with temperatures around 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the north.
In New York we could have 27 °C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good possibilities for temperatures above the average for the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people on the six television networks have seen an interesting quarter of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony, the Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who was accused of a sexual assault that was due to occur in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political position continued, as television stations have interrupted the regular program due to Friday's transformation in the last minute: the deal that the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake has made, namely that the FBI will conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh had smacked her in a guilty state and tried to seduce her at high school.
Kavanaugh said in his burn story that he was 100% convinced that it didn't happen.
Nielsen reports that Friday's testimony should be viewed by more than 20.4 million people.
The company has an average viewing of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC television networks.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that performed the witnessing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with the damage to the viewers who watch the program in the offices.
For a easier performance, viewing is similar to playing the football game of the finals or awarding the American Film Academy.
Televisy Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh's appointment, leads to all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
The second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, and CNN 2.52 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
The interest also remained high after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in the fifth drama.
After the official of the moderate Republican stated that he would vote in favour of Kavanough, CNN and CBS recorded on Friday morning that protesters yelled at him when he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearings of the Justice Committee.
During the song, he hung his eyes for a few minutes, which caught the CNN TV cameras alive.
"I'm standing here in front of you," some woman told him.
"You think he's telling the truth to the state?
You have power, while many women are helpless."
Flake said that his office had made a statement, and he added that he would talk more about the committee's hearing, and then the door was shut.
All television networks were also delivered to live hours later when the Justice Committee voted on the presentation of the Kavanaugh nomination in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, to which the minority party called.
In this part, Flakea talked to a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decided because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to appoint Kavanauga without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an investigation by the US Federal Investigation Office (FBI) regarding the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused criticism of "playing political games" in the Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with Sunday Times, criticized her plans for leaving the European Union 'playing political games' with the British future and undermining national interests.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Therese May at a Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the magazine, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit Plan and said that it was a proposal that Britain and the EU pay the other 'absorbently' duties.
Shooting on Waydea Sims: police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of death of LSU team player
The police arrested a suspect in the final shooting at Waydea Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player on the LSU team.
After a police report from Baron Rouge, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for a second-degree murder charge.
Officials published a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson and the police indicated that during the fight Sims lost his sunglasses.
The police found the sunglasses on the screen and on them Simpson's DNA, the CBS television complements WAFB's television reports.
After Simpson's hearing, the police made a statement that he admitted he shot Waydee to death.
Security is 350,000 dollars, the lawyer reports.
A survey from the East Baton Rouge Parish district issued a previous report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the neck.
The police are grateful to the special units for assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest of the Luusian state police, the criminal police lab, the South University police and the residents of the area.
The sports director of the LSU Joe Alleva team thanked the local authorities for their "care and search for rights".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
The previous season, on average, collected 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the game.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU Will Wade team said that the team was "strung" and "in shock" because of Wayde's death.
“That’s what worries you all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano ash in Ciudad de Mexico
The ashes of the Vulcan Popocatepetl have reached the southern neighbours of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans not to get close to the volcano, as the activity in the crater was strengthened and 183 gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The Center has observed several cases of thunder and thunderstorms.
The pictures on social networks showed thin ash that covered the windshields of cars in the vicinity of the main city of Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increased activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometres south-east of the main city, after a 7.1 degree earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters supporting independence clashed with anti-police police units and thousands of people joined the rival demonstration, marking the first anniversary of the Catalan polarized withdrawal vote.
A group of masked separatist supporters, who had been detained by anti-police police units, wrapped them with eggs and metal in dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there was also a fight, where policemen had to use pendants to stop the clashes.
Independence supporters, who have been calling for several hours 'without forgetting, without forgiveness', faced protestors who supported unity and shouted 'To live Spain!'.
According to local media, 40 people in protests have been injured more easily.
The year after the referendum on 1 October, which was marked in Madrid as illegal and the Catalan separatists celebrated, tensions in the region supporting independence remain.
Most voters voted for independence, although the participation was low, since the opposition to the removal had greatly boycotted the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop voting in the region in violent clashes.
Groups supporting independence were camped at night in front of the polls to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to go another way.
68-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope that Catalonia would become independent.
“We had one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry with happiness because they could love, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important, although close victories in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties supporting independence have found it difficult to maintain the initiative this year, since many of the most well-known leaders are in voluntary exile or are awaiting trial in support of their role in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest with the phone in support of the police, explained that the protests were exacerbated by politics on both sides.
“Treatment is rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders, who have been in custody since the end of last year before the start of the trial, announced that he will run for elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Registration in European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the oppression we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men who flew with the car into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested because they had repeatedly taken their car into the house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in the street of Ballyngard Crescent on Thursday at about 19.30 after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said they were damaged the door and the building itself.
At some point, they're supposed to fire the car with a single gun.
With Mengaja's score, Livingstone won from 1:0 against Ranksom
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingstone secured the victory
Livingston suspected Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to admit his second defeat in 18 matches as a coach from the Ibrox club.
The arrow of Dolly Mengaja took care of the difference, because Gary Holt's team was the same as the Hibernian team in the other place.
Gerrard's team was so unbeatable in the guests of this year's championship, and the next week they're waiting for Hearts, who lead on the ladder and behind which they're left behind by eight points.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone has increased its number of failures in the six-game division and Holt's chief coach, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet experienced defeat.
Livingston has made opportunities for direct guests
Holt's team should be running a lot ahead of the meeting, as they have caused a lot of problems with their directness.
Scott Robinson made a breakthrough, but he sent the ball over the door frame, then Alan Lithgow hit the doorway, and Craig Halket shot his head over the goal.
Guests left the game Ranksom, knowing that guests may be at risk of interruptions in the attack.
And in this way they came to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingstone a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengai, who shot and struck in the middle of the criminal space.
The Rangers had a bigger possession of the ball, but domestic defenses couldn't break and Liam Kelly's doorman didn't have a lot of work.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos defended Kelly.
The doorman of Rangers's Allan McGregor had his leg shot Scott Pittman, and Lithgow had shot himself out of one of the other liveston's stops in the attack.
The proposals continued to come to Livingstone's criminal court, but the domestics refused all attacks, two violations – Halket's violation of Glen Middleton's replacement and a hand-playing violation – but the judge did not arrive.
‘Excellent performance’ of Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Excellent performance and result for Livingstone.
They have all been excellent and continue beyond expectations in this way.
The game style and position have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt should be credited with the merit of the way he woke up the team from his income.
Junakov was big.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and arranged well for a well-organised defense, while Menga kept in readiness Connor Goldson and Joe Woralla.
However, the rank simply lacked inspiration.
Although under the leadership of Gerrard, they lack these standards.
There was no shot at the target – only once they successfully won the protection of the guests – and it was some kind of wake-up for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogans in Cologne accepted mixed
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, they ruled over smiles and blue skys.
Today is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes about human rights, the freedom of the press and the Turkish approach to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a huge new bridge.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish people outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 heads from gathering at the mill, but many supporters were able to get closer to seeing their president.
It also expressed its opinion to hundreds of protestors – among them many Kurds – who do not support the Erdogan governments and condemn Erdogan's policy and decision by the German government to greet him in the country.
Contrary protests reflect the separation with regard to the visitor, whom some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others despise as autocrats.
Road accident in Deptford: the biker was fatally accidented in a car race
In London, the rider died of a fatal accident during the race in which the car was involved.
An accident occurred near the crossroads between the streets of Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, on a road in Deptford on the south-east of the city at about 10.15 after the British summer time.
The car driver stopped and the rescuers arrived, but the man died in the end of the accident.
The accident happened only a few months after the rider died in a race in which the car driver fled, about 1.5 km from the accident on the Children Street Street.
The police have made a statement that the police are checking the identity of the man to be able to inform his own.
They set up roadblocks and rerouted the bus lines and advised the motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six guards injured in a riot
Six prison guards were injured in an emergency in a strictly protected male prison, reported by the prison administration.
Nered broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9.30 after the British summer time and is still running.
Police officers from the “Tornado” unit have been called to take care of an emergency involving eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
A few minor injuries on the face were provided in the area itself.
The representative of the prison staff said: “We have called a specially trained staff who will take care of the emergency in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members suffered injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will be responsible for this and may therefore be further behind bars."
In the HMP Long Lartin prison there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
June was reported to have been a prison manager in hospital because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, they called an anti-police unit to intervene in a severe riot in which the staff were attacked with billiard rounds.
Orkan Rosa threatens Pheonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, as the remaining energy of the Rosa hurricane narrows the way through the south-west of the desert and presents the danger of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning against sudden Monday and Tuesday floods for West Arizona, south and east Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including the towns Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Orkan Rosa was supposed to get mad at Phoenix on Tuesday, and he'll be approaching late on Monday with the rain.
The National Time Service in Phoenix said that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or depression within 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Orkan Katrina (1967) was well over 60 kilometres from the border of Arizona.’
The latest models of the National Centre for Orcs provide 50 to 100 mm of rainfall with individual rainfalls up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
Other south-west desert areas, including Rockies and Great Basin, are expected from 25 to 50 mm falls, individual falls up to 100 mm are possible.
For areas beyond the danger of sudden floods, the rain of the Rosa hurricane may be a blessing because the region has been affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be useful, because in the south-west it is currently a dry period.
“After the US drought tracking centre has been indicated, good 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
The path of Orkan Rosa leads first to the land of the Gulf of California, Mexico.
Rosa, who still has the power of the hurricane on Sunday morning with the maximum wind speed of 137 kilometres per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and moves north with a speed of 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm comes in contact with the colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
It is expected that the land will reach Mexico with the power of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The falls in the parts of Mexico can be severe and therefore pose a great threat to the fleet.
“From the Baja California Peninsula to the north-west of Sonora we expect 75 to 150 mm of rainfall with a 250 mm rainfall,” they reported on the website weather.com.
Orkan Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and against the South Utah until late evening on Tuesday.
"The greatest danger that we expect from the hurricane of Rosa or its remains is the abundant rains in the Baj Caliphonia peninsula in the north-west of Sonore and in the American South-west desert," said the National Centre for the hurricanes.
These falls may cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts and land-times in the mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for the sum of attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old in Somerset with stab wounds.
The wounded teenager was found in the Excelsion Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4.00 after the British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in Radstock, reports the Avon and Somerset police.
The cops are calling anyone who might have picked up the event by phone to get in touch.
Trump said Kavanaugh was a "suffering and angry" democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugha is a voice against incompetence and unheard of the tactics of a democratic party," Trump told the assembly in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was a "suffering and angry" democratic party in the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of the convention on Thursday, with a clear and emotional denial of Christine Blasey Ford's accusations that she had been sexually assaulted for decades when she was a teenager.
She also talked to Ford about her accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that the day “Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliantness, quality and courage”.
"The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugha is the vote for the appointment of one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an exceptional record of public service," said a number of supporters in West Virginia.
The President specifically mentioned the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the electoral participation of the Republicans in the interim elections.
“For five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm really trying with the candidacy," he said.
“That's why I fight for excellent candidates everywhere.”
Trump claims that democracy is on the mission of "responsibility and obstruction".
The first key procedural vote in the CNN Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh was to take place no later than Friday, the advisor of the Republican Party told CNN.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami of more than a hundred people killed, the number of victims is increasing
On Saturday, the authorities reported that in the earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people died, many of the huge waves that were blowing the coast.
On Friday, more than a hundred people gathered at a beach festival in Pala, when six meters of waves struck the coast and took many to death and destroyed everything on their way.
Cunami followed the earthquake at 7.5 degrees.
“When there was a danger of tsunami yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they became victims,” said a representative of the Indonesian agency for the mitigation of the BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a meeting in Jakarta.
“Cunami didn’t come alone, he drove cars, trees, houses, everything fell to the ground,” explained Nugroho and added that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at speed 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said that some people went to the trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photographs from the air published by the crash agency show destroyed buildings and shops, fences and broken bridges, and mosses surrounded by water.
The stormy sun continued to raid the coastal city on Saturday.
In the 2.4 million people in the area, there was a series of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in the Friday earthquake was approximately 200 times greater than the power of the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of the long and narrow bay, should increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “abstaining” and said that more than a thousand houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, adding that 540 were injured, and 29 were missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and the damage may be greater by the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area of Dongal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
As Nugro said, communications are completely interrupted and have no information from the Dongal area.
“More than 300,000 people live in the area,” said the statement of the Red Cross and added that staff and volunteers are moving away from affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get even worse,” they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms, since it did not inform the public that the tsunami had affected Paul, but officials say the waves had just arrived at the time of the issue.
In the amateur video published on social networks, it seems that men on the top floor scream at people on the street in the nearby tsunamis.
In a few minutes, the water wall ran along the coast and took the buildings and cars with it.
At Reuters, they could not confirm the authenticity of the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamis have caused an electricity leak that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
The authorities report that the army began to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic necessities of life.
The airport was open only to provide aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Wido is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims in the Indonesian tsunami increased to over 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Dosebbe, the members of the World Vision organization from Dongala arrived safely in Pala, where the employees in the courtyard had set up a shelter from the floor, but on the way they saw numerous displays of relaxation.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with a lot of experience would not be allowed to come to Paul.
In accordance with the Indonesian regulations, the overseas funding, stocks and assistance of staff shall be authorised only if the city is declared an accident for the area of the national accident.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still considered an accident at the province level,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘All right, this is a national accident’, we can accept international aid, but there is no such status.”
The second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, the friends and relatives of the missing ones cling to the hope that their nearby miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped for two days under the ruins and her mother's body was lying next to her.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of Indonesian Naval Fall representatives, trained two missing sailors for Asian games that ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Second, caught at Roa Roa Hotel, they were his students by the words of Mr. Mandagija.
“As an old man in the field of nuclear waste, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that in an hour when the news of the collapse of Roa Roa's hotel circled around the community of sailors, he sent messages in the app to whatsApp competitors in Palu, who attended the festival on the beach.
But his messages were marked only with one grey bell instead of two blues.
“I think this means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Dads stole 26.750 USD while filling the ATM in downtown Newport on the Levee
After a police report from Newport, Dads stole 26.750 USD from the security department Brink’s, who filled out the ATM in the center of Newport on the Leeve.
The car driver emptied the ATM in the fun complex and was preparing to deliver the money, in a public statement he wrote to Detective Dennis McCarthy.
While he was employed, another man “approached to the employees’ security service Brink’s from the back” and stole the money bag for delivery.
After the report, the Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate the exact number of participants.
All who have information about the identity of suspects should call the Newport police number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name – in Ye.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “Betje with the official name Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has named Yes for a while and has also used it for the title of his eight-year-old album, which was released in June.
The change comes just before his performance at the Saturday Night Live show, where he will present his new Yandhi album.
He will replace the singer Ariano grande, who rejected the performance for “specific reasons” and told the performer.
The word is an abbreviation of his current professional name, but West has already said that it has religious significance to him.
“I think that “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where “you” (i.e.),” West said at the beginning of this year when he spoke about the title of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you and I'm all me.
Kanye, which means “one”, I changed into Ye – it reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are.”
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed his desire for Love and Brother Love.
The former West co-worker, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with thought or without him and with large letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised he would not use troops against civilians
Newly-elected Mexican President Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed that he would never use military force against civilians, just as the state nears the 50th anniversary of the bloody violence against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza market that "he will never use forces to stop the Mexican people."
At a time when left-wing student movements began to operate in Latin America, at peaceful demonstrations on the market on October 2, 1968, soldiers started shooting and killing 300 people.
Lopez Obador vowed to support young Mexicans and students to provide monthly grants and open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education drew young people into criminal societies.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
Since China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the resources it uses to research in this field, it says the investor and expert for the artistic intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various parts of the American government have announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the US does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in innovations in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Improving the budget for research on artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are very much for the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
Double-financing could double the possibility that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence in the US would happen, Lee told the CNBC this week in an interview.
Lee, whose book “AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month, was the founder of the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a company president of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most visible companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University developed an art intelligence system that won the highest ranking American player in the game Othello, and later was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee said he was familiar with the previous American government technological contests, such as the game in robotics organised by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when it will be the next time he will find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. must work hard if they want to receive state support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes the best academics, but it’s companies,” Lee explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working best with the university in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the US strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think we should offer a green card automatically to people with a doctor from artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the artificial intelligence of a new generation.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences is funding people in academic institutions, like the National Scientific Foundation and other government organisations, to distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a joint committee for artificial intelligence.
This month, the DARPA announced an investment in the AI Next in the amount of two billion USD.
National Scientific Foundation (NSF) in research on artificial intelligence is currently investing more than USD 100 million per year
Meanwhile, American legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has not done anything for months.
Macedonians will decide at the referendum to change the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday at the referendum to convert their country's name to the 'North Macedonia'. This would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its province named Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbour's name represents the right to their territory and has put a veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum, but the boycott campaign expressed doubt that the participation would be at least 50%, as far as it is necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question at the referendum was: ‘Are you a member of NATO and the EU by adopting an agreement with Greece?’
Supporters of the referendum, including President Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO, for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote, which will be decided.
The change of names requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission has notified that no irregularities have been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to choose for my children, our city is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjos Tanevski, a voters from Skopje’s capital.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško, gave their votes in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018 for a referendum in Macedonia on the amendment of the name of the country that would open the way to NATO and the European Union.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small oven and set up chairs in front of tents set up by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for Nata and the EU, but we want to join with our heads raised, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-pean integration."
The President of the Zaev Government says that NATO membership will make a very necessary investment in Macedonia with a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and Nato," Zaev said after giving his election list.
He added that it would be a positive result of 'the confirmation of our future'.
The survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday showed that the referendum would take place between 30 and 43% of voters, which is less than the required electoral participation.
The second survey carried out by the Macedonian TV Telma showed that 57% of respondents would prefer Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote for them.
In order for the referendum to succeed, there must be a 50-percent vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious impact on the policy of the Western government, which took over the mandate of last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has played the whole of Brighton's defense and victory
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won Brighton's victory at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester in England on Saturday at Manchester City with 2-0.
Aguere's strike in 65 minutes was ridiculously simple.
Argentinian attacker accepted a play at the center of the game at the start of the action.
He ran between three Brighton's defense players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He played one of the defense players and was faster than the others on the property of Brighton's crime scene.
Then he gave Sterling to his left.
With his first touch on the criminal scene, the English attacker returned to Aguere, who with his right leg beat Brighton's doorman Mathew Ryan and sent the ball to the right side of the network.
"Aguero faces problems in his legs," the journalist told the coach City Pep Guardiola.
"We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But Sterling was the one who provided the blue son's initial advantage in the first English league.
The goal was reached in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's half.
The ball on the left hand gave Leroy a nice hand to Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times, and then sent the ball to Sterling against the remote door.
The blue son's attacker was running the ball into the net just before she ran out of naked space.
The city will meet at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. in the group part of the League of champions with Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies and ruin their opportunities for title
The Nationals team is out of the way, so there's no special reason for a new attack.
But always the competitor Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be able to rise to the metal cricket against the Colorado Rockies team. This will only happen if Rockies still have the opportunity to play at the end, because in the Western League they have the advantage of the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
Rockies on Friday with a 5:2 win over the Nationals team provided at least the organizer's invitation, but they are still waiting for their first address in the division.
“Even though we can’t get anything, we can at least play in the great atmosphere before a lot of people here in Denver and the opposite team will play at the probably highest level this year.
So why don't you want to compete?"
Nationals have not yet published the names of the first metal in a week, but in this case it is likely to be the metal Scherzer.
Scherzer, which will be the first metal since 34th century, is a heavy-duty player on Thursday and would have had enough days of rest by week.
The Washington right-wing player collected 18 wins and 7 wins with an average of 2,53 and 300 awards with hits in 220 2/3 changes this season.
Tromp at the meetings in West Virginia
The President directly addressed the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of Republican electoral participation in the interim elections.
"All we've done will be on the dice in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I really am trying with the candidacy, so I am fighting for excellent candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats and it is happening now.
They're determined to take over the area again, using all the means they can.
However, they are affected by those who have to be able to obtain power and control. This is what they want, power and control, but we will not give them this."
According to him, democracy is on the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
“And you have been able to observe this in the last four days,” he said and labeled the Democrats as “serious, evil, low and false”.
A member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, was appointed by name, and a public hearing was heard of the vote.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you published the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, no, wait, that was really a bad body speaker, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their opinion, she is impatient.
When Momentum's activist in my local party called me a confidant, it wasn't a surprise.
Finally, I am the last in a number of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party who we are not interested in expressing my opinion.
My colleague, Ambassador Joan Ryan, happened the same way because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, it went on a proposal of mistrust for my non-conformity with Jeremy Corby.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
In a statement on Friday, the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting said that ‘we want meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
In the eight years since I was a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, the Friday meetings were mostly exactly that way.
Today, the majority of the meetings unfortunately do not use such a tone and the promise of a “more friendly and gentler” policy has been forgotten for a long time when it has even begun.
It is increasingly apparent that different views in the labyrinth parties are not allowed and that in each opinion it is acceptable to guide the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues, whom I had previously thought to share similar political views, expected me to change my opinion and take up the position I would never agree with – whether it would be in the field of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – they follow criticisms on social networks that call for non-election, condemn middle politics, and tell me that they shouldn’t be in a labyrinth party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I have more luck than some of my colleagues, because the comments I make are just political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who meet each day with the flood of sexist or racist condolences, but they are not allowed to be frightened.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this period of policy is how abuse rates have become somewhat common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with every proposal of non-confidentialness or amendment of the rules for the choice of a party becomes more difficult.
In the last two years, I have received much advice to turn my head off and not be so loud, and I will be “all right” with me.
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student – the reason for this was the greed of the Tatcher government, which caused the teacher in my primary school to give up verbally – I, as a local councillor or government minister, have tried to take on better public services for those who need them most.
I've never hidden my political beliefs, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused because of my political position and areas I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their wishes after the waste of time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the labor party at a time when the state is swimming against a brigit that will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my right message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, whether or not they are members of a laborer's party: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat of non-choice or political suitability will turn me away from acting in the best interest of all of you.

38:17 Melrose: Father's disobedience to the superior authority
Two well-known attempts have failed a few final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr won the victory in this wonderful fun championship game of days.
Now they're at the top of the ladder and they're the only unencumbered team of ten.
In the end, their top defense and better use of the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason for satisfaction.
“In our advanced games, we have passed many trials and we are still unaccompanied, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The joys of the Ayra team, the opportunities have taken advantage of better than we have."
Grant Anderson's mission in 14 minutes, turned Frazier Climo, Ayr took the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who received it in the wariros game, meant a number of beats for Melrose and Jason Baggottt was a forceless attempt without conversion.
Climo increased his leadership for Ayr at the time of the fall and then turned his self-test for score 17:5 for Ayr at the time of death.
But Melrose began the second half and tried Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggot, to reduce the remainder to five points.
It was followed by a long interruption due to the serious damage caused by Ruaridh Knott, who was carried on the carriages, and then Ayr progressed with the attempt of Stafford McDowall, who transformed Climo.
The interim captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received the yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the game with the player more with an unconformed attempt of Bruce Colvine at the end of the period of intense pressure.
But the hosts returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card due to the opposition of Clima without a ball, MacPherson got a hit.
Climo scored points after Kyle Rowe shot David Armstrong's ring and sent Gregor Henry's wing player in the fifth guest attempt.
The star of the Still Game series starts a new career in hospitality
The star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is obviously given to the hospitality, it is expected to become the director of the licensed company with restaurants.
A 56-year-old in a popular BBC series, for which he also wrote the script, plays Jack Jarvis along with a long-term partner in comedy Greg Hemphil.
Two announced that after the next ninth season, Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, Afjergmorn Limited is the director of the company.
The player did not want to comment on the stories, but the source for Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan want to be included in the "flowery hospitality" in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia, which does not have access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling at the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, sailor blue flags are highlighted.
Sea bases from Lake Titicak to Amazon are covered with a slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to return it."
In southern Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody dispute due to natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive — like the fluttering of the Pacific Ocean.
This hope may now be the greatest after decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will receive it after five years of consultation on 1 October.
“Bolivia has a beginning, a spirit of unity and impartiality, and of course in a positive spirit expects a result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
The number of Bolivians will look at the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will decide in the province of Bolivia, which insists that, after decades of unrest, it must be negotiated on Bolivia's access to sovereign access to the sea.
Here's Morales, a Bolivian charismatic home president, waiting next year for a controversial battle to be re-elected, has also high expectations for Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not decide on Bolivia’s arrival – and even if it would, it would not change much.
The United Nations headquarters in the Netherlands has not authorized Bolivia to grant Chilean territory, nor will it decide on the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after hearing the concluding arguments means that the case ‘was not complicated’,” said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, they've not spoken in the province of Bolivia, but they may be a lot of people.
"The current Bolivian government has used the question of access to the sea," Zárateev said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric from the Chilean people had all the good that might have remained, she explained.
The talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but then it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
They haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring “an exceptional opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile” and the possibility to “end 139-year disagreements with each other”, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular Latin American presidents – used the maritime issue as a political resistance.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to make sure that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea said that nuclear disarmament would not happen if it could not be trusted by the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never destroy their nuclear weapon if they could not trust Washington.
Ri had a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil their promises made at a meeting between the leaders of the rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when American minister Mike Pompeo was apparently before the resumption of nuclear diplomacy, which was at a dead end, more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says that the United States is wrong if they think that the continuation of sanctions and the contract of the announcement of the end of the Korean war in North Korea will be on their knees.
Washington is careful to confirm the prediction without first taking decisive action to disarm Pjongang.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want another meeting.
But it goes down to the general doubt that Pyongyang thinks seriously about the withdrawal of the weapon that the state sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
In fashion journals in Paris, discover the latest line of huge covers coming in stores with price-accessible brands near you
If you want to complete your collection covered or completely hidden from the sun, you do not need to search further.
The designer Valentino and Thom Browne discovered in their spring and summer 2019 collections a collection of amazingly large covers that blinded the style in Paris's weekly fashion.
Very impractical cover this summer, Instagram flooded, and the designers sent their spectacular creations to the fashion track.
Valentine's hair, the most outstanding, was the coat in a beige color with wide edges decorated with feathers of similar additions in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other too many fashion supplements included shells with precious stones, magic hats and even pineapple – but your heads will not be warmed.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks – just the right time for the night of the witches.
Many colorful masks have supple lips and are more similar masks to Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation was similar to that used to melt with a breath and glasses, and the other was seen as a grain with a degree of ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
The fashion experts predict that the grand cover will come to the shops near you.
The wide hats are closely followed by ‘La Bombi’, broken hats with 60-centimeter ends were observed in Rihanni and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand for an extremely non-practical hat that flooded the social network sent another great creation – a broken beach bag, which was almost as big as a model in the baths she was wearing.
The bag of rafia in burnt orange, surrounded by rafia resins and handcuffs from white leather, was the central part of the La Riviera collection in Paris in spring/spring 2019.
The Stylist of the famous Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect large coats and bags for the beach to arrive in the store for the following summer – because the designer made such a powerful impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many supplements.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is key to global citizens
Scottish independent schools enjoyed the fames of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a number of exceptional results on the trials that are further enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Single Schools Council (SCIS) strive to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Self-employed schools want their students to prepare for further and higher education, the chosen career path and the city they have as global citizens.
As the education sector, which can shape and implement the adapted school programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, the conversation will come to his mind.
But if you speak with a man in his mother tongue, his words will come to his heart."
This is a good reminder that we must not rely solely on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s results from recent studies show that the languages at the top of the ladder with the highest levels of success in self-schools.
68 percent of students who have learned a foreign language have achieved a good score.
The data collected in 74 schools in the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 percent of students had achieved a good grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students had a good score.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
The languages are considered to be an object of choice in teaching plans for independent schools, and others are treated as objects in the fields of natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
The survey carried out by the Commission in 2014 for the employment and training of the United Kingdom showed that, for reasons why employers are suffering in order to fill a job vacancy, 17% of us attribute a lack of language knowledge.
Therefore, language knowledge is becoming more and more urgent in preparing young people for their future career.
For future employment opportunities that require language knowledge, these skills are essential in the global world.
If someone learns another language, he has a great advantage in the future, regardless of the career he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge.
A multilingual person who can agree directly with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
The 2013 YouTube survey, involving more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom, showed that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to speak, with France being the only language spoken by the two-way majority of respondents, that is 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding suitable employment.
Schools in Scotland differ in the languages they are taught.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others are teaching languages that should be the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, you will always be able to choose a number of languages taught by experts in this area in private schools.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the knowledge they need to succeed, regardless of what the future brings.
In the global business environment, language remains extremely important for the future of the country, and this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be treated as ‘international communication skills’.
Self-employed schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will be debiting in San Diego on Sunday in Lakersov's dress.
For fans who enjoy LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers team, waiting will soon end.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play in the Sunday opening game scheduled for the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
He doesn't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
“More than one and less than 48” explained Walton on the official website of Lakers.
The official rapporteur of the Lakers team Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six Lakers game before the season.
"At this stage, I don't need a race before the season," he said.
trumpet assembly in West Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling in West Virginia begins a series of meetings in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump's five planned meetings next week, including the formations in its countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for a free place in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to get support for the upcoming interim elections, as the Republican is threatening the loss of control of Congress after the November vote.
At what time will Trump's assembly in West Virginia and where online will it be possible to view it?
The trumpet assembly in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held on Saturday, 29 September 2018, at 7 p.m. in the east time.
Trump collection in West Virginia can be viewed live online on the YouTube channel.
Trump will probably talk about the candidates' hearings for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh this week, which has become tense due to allegations of sexual misconduct, which is why the Senate's confirmation is expected to be postponed for one week to conduct an investigation by the FBI.
But the primary objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans, who are awaiting important elections in November, to get a new start.
Therefore, in the campaign of President Trump, these five meetings were intended to "encourage volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"The monitoring of the congress is so important for his programme that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the hard season," Reuters told the representative of Trump's campaign, who does not want to be appointed.
Today's meeting at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling would also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania following the report of West Virginia MetroNews, which would attract the interest of Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia the second time in the last month, in which he received more than 40 percent of the points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate for a Senate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in public research.
"For Morrisey, it is a bad sign that the president must come and "get him up" in public research," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, after Reuters's report.
Ryder's podal 2018: US team still wants to win and maintain hope before Sunday's solo fights
After three foreign games, the two foursomes may well have been what Ryder's prank this year needed on Saturday afternoon.
Nothing is completely invented in sports, but players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where's anything going now?
“They have had six points of advantage, but now they have four, so this is probably a new start for us,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage because it leads four points, and 12 more can be achieved.
But the Americans, according to Spiet's words, feel that they have wind in the sails, and among other things, they were encouraged by the shape of Spietha and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them won three points of four.
Speeth was killed from the initial strike to the greenery and gave a good example.
The screams of happiness continued to become louder and led to a decisive blow when Thomas and his two remaining points were equivalent in the fourth game.
The hit that brought them a win on the 15th of August, he made a similar scream, such as to let you know that we believe that the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to look for your inner power and focus on your game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes to glory.
The only player with more points than Speeth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of Ryder's kiss.
An unusual but charming two of Europe has won four points from four and are infallible.
The two "Molliwood" were the only ones who didn't hit Bugi on Saturday afternoon, but Bugi was also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which energy flows between them and the deaf community obviously confirms the fact that the players who are to be defeated on Sunday are the ones who are to be won, and no other player could better seal Europe's possible victories than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun comes over the Le Golf National.
And if possible, they're both in different holes at the same time.
But talking about European fame would be too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergia Garcio, a morning hero in the game with four balls, who was in a couple with Alex Noren.
Because of the buggy and two double bugs on the first nine holes, Spain and Sweden fell into a crisis from which they did not find a way out.
But on Saturday, the players won't have any help.
Games with four balls and twins of two are exceptional to be closely monitored due to communication between couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way in which the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has so far played better than the team and has a great advantage over the last day, but the two-two-two-year-olds have shown that the US team also has a wish to win, which some, especially on the American side, have doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day of Ryder's cup
Europe goes on the last day of Ryder's kiss with a good advantage after the four-games and two-two-two-two-two games are run at 10:6 against the United States.
The excellent couple, composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, gave all of himself and with two victories over Tiger Woods and in the Le Golf National game, blew four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorna, who is trying to win the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltina, had in the morning games four balls of power over the American team that was wrong and reported in a series of 3:1.
The U.S. team got better fighting in the two doubles where they won two games, but the rest could not be rewarded.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 semi-finals if they want to keep a trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European journalist to win four consecutive points, while with Molinare (a couple called Molliwood) after a sensational weekend only another couple who won four points in their first four games in Ryder's history.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four balls, they again proved and even more convincingly won the spent Woods and American journalist Bryson Dechambeauj with 5 and 4.
Woods, who moved through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at the moment, but lost 19 of the 29 games in battles with four balls and two doubles, of which seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was born to play with four balls in the morning, returned for two and a couple with Henrik Stenson with 2 and 1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who were placed on the first and third world ladders.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the south-west part of Paris, not everything went according to the plans of the Europe team.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new criterion for the Americans on Saturday.
With 2 and 1 they firmly won against Spanish Jon Rahmu and Ian Poulter in the game with four balls and later returned and won Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in the two doubles, losing the first two holes.
Only once in Ryder's history did the team return after the remaining four points in front of the single doubt, although Fury's team only needs an equation to maintain the trophy.
But after two days in another place, the Sunday attack may seem to be too much of a threat to her.
North Korea: "Without confidence we will not be disarmed unilaterally"
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continued implementation of sanctions would cause increasing mistrust in the United States of America and that under such conditions North Korea would certainly not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapon.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this World Authority, Ri Jong Ho said that North Korea had over the past year adopted a number of "significant measures in good will" such as stopping the implementation of nuclear and missile tests, substantiating nuclear testing sites, and promising that nuclear weapons and technology would not be expanded.
“However, we do not see an appropriate US response,” he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not be confident of state security and under such conditions we will never be the first to disarm on the one hand."
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korea's complaints about Washington's resistance to a progressive nuclear disarmament approach, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking progressive measures, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pjonggang had done in the past.
Ri made a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current president of the United States and the North Korean leader, who took place on 12 June in Singapore. Kim then committed himself to "the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised North Korea security.
North Korea wants the official conclusion of the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington also did not allow the call to release the strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"The US insists that we first have to disarm ourselves and step up the pressure with sanctions to achieve its objectives by force, and even agree to the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions could put us on our knees is a unrealistic hope for people who don’t know us at all.
However, it is a challenge to see that further implementation of sanctions is further deepening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kimo and Trump, which the US President presented to the United Nations Assembly at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kimo and South Korean President Mun Jae In, which took place in the past five months, and added: "If the problems of nuclear disarmament were to be discussed with South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not be agreed upon at such a dead point."
Nevertheless, the tone of Rije's speech was quite different from that of the year when the General Assembly of the United Nations said that the attack on the United States of America's coastal part with North Korean missiles was inevitable, after "Mrs. Evil President," Trump Kim referred to as "a rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations Assembly and his courage to take action to disarm him, but said that he was still waiting for a lot of work and that sanctions should remain valid until North Korea is disbanded.
On Wednesday, Trump said that this was not a set time frame, and he said: “The duration can be two years, three years or five months – this is not important.”
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue without exception until we recognise the complete, complete and verified nuclear disarmament situation."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions for North Korea in order to prevent the financing of North Korean nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompey met with Riem at the United Nations General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month for preparations at the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pjongang in July, he said that progress had been made, and North Korea had criticised him for a few hours, if his demands were "gangster".
North Korea committed itself, at a meeting with Muna this month, to the support of the missile testing station and the nuclear testing infrastructure if the United States is to take appropriate measures.
It should be noted by Kim that the ‘appropriate measures’ mean the security measures which Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard University attend a course they learn how to take enough time to rest
The aim of the new course this year at Harvard University is to teach all graduate students how to enjoy more sleep. They want to fight against the growing masquerading culture of "celonatic" learning, where the powers are mixed with caffeine.
The university professor found that students of the world's best universities often don't know the basis for caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, has developed a course of his first kind in the United States.
After his lecture on the impact of the lack of sleep on learning, he decided to pursue such a course.
After the lecture, a girl approached him and said, “Why do I know that right now when I’m in my last year?”
She said no one else told her how important a sleeper was, and for The Daily Telegraph, the professor said it surprised him.
The course they first perform this year is about the key importance of good sleep habits for study and sports success as well as for improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, says that they decided on such a course when they found that during the week, students were severely deprived of sleep.
The single course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, the picture is the door of a student's home where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports blankets and books to get information about the effect of caffeine and light, the effect of a lack of sleep on sports success and the importance of sleep routines.
In the second section, participants find that long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of cardiac arrest, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the student village with interactive icons encourages the participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that students' behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to get acquainted with these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health affects smoking cigarettes," adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride is still present during “lifelong learning”. He adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, resulting in a lack of sleep, are growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be the “covery weapon” of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. Thus, the weight gain can also be avoided – the brains, due to the lack of sleep, go hungry, and the students are constantly hungry.
A 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Cheisler to form a course. Last year, he attended one of the professors' lectures at Harvard.
He says that his lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct a course throughout the student village.
It is hoped that in the next phase, the undergraduate students will be able to apply for the completion of a similar study programme before joining the competition institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students continue to wake up to sleep as well as to wake up. He also wants to warn them of the harmful effects of “moderate lights” that give them electronic displays and LED lighting, as they can cause the imbalance of the Circadian rhythm, which makes it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with a hitch on Gerrard's team
Rangers again defeated in the guests: Dolly Menga in Livingstone announced Steven Gerrard's team sentenced to defeat by 1 : 0.
The team from Ibroxa hunted its first guest victory after the February victory at St. Johnstone Stadium with 4 : 1, but Gary Holt's team beat her second defeat in 18 matches, since the leader of the team Gerrard, leaving his team behind 8 points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, but the chosen species of Rangers did not give the impression that he wanted to be equal.
The Rangers fell to a common place, and Livingstone progressed to a third place, but the Hibernian team remained with the difference of goals.
The weight of Rangers was not the end. Calum Spence, a foreign judge, suffered a head injury when after reporting it, the object came from the city of the cheerleaders of the guest team.
Gerrard, in a crew that beat Ayr without any trouble and placed himself in the semifinals of Betfred Cup, made eight shifts.
On the other hand, Holt was held by the audited body of Livingstone, who had taken over the hearts of the team a week earlier, and he was no doubt excited about how his influential team effectively neutralized all the guests' attempts.
The Rangers had a higher ownership of the ball, but Livingstone made better use of it.
The first chance came two minutes after Menga first found Scott Pittman, and then went to the goal of Allan McGregor, but he was linked to the performance inaccurate and missed the opportunity.
Long free shot Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halket, but the ball then his defense assistant Alan Lithgow was unable to score.
In the last third, Rangers took control, but the game said more about hope than the actual wish after the victory.
Alfredo Morelos was pretty sure that after a 15-minute race with Steven Lawless, a criminal shot was to be reached, but Judge Steven Thomson's demands for Columbia fell into a car.
Rangsom's first half was able to make up only two shots on the target, but he didn't shoot with the head sent against the target by Lassan Coulibally, or the ball of Ovie Ejarija, nothing for Liam Kelly's doorman posed any danger.
Livingstone’s initial goal in 34 minutes may have surprised everything, but due to its endurance, it has already been completely deserved.
Rangsom has not been able to deliver another long-term Jacobs follow-up.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher went to Scott Robinson, who made Mengi routinely ready for a simple end to the attack.
Gerrard took action and, during his vacation, Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent's wing player, who immediately showed up with Morelos, but Kelly effectively pulled out his lines and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, with Lithgow and Halket taking care of more than one dish before the goal.
Holt's team could have increased the leadership by the end of the race, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithuania was out of date.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given a chance to shoot after contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson didn't admit it.
Almanah: Geiger's inventor
We present a page from the Almanac of our Sunday editions: September 30, 1882, so today more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany, who later became a world-famous physicist.
Geiger developed the method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called Geiger's shield.
This became a stage in the scientific world, and he also got his place in pop-culture, such as in the movie “Bells of Coronado” in 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play the cowboy scientist:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's shield. It's used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put your ears on, you can hear the effect on the atom's radioactive activity in the materials."
Evans: "Madonca, but now they're really getting out!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
I'm an invention with his name and he lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize attack cells
A new cancer vaccine can learn to recognize and destroy the immune system
The vaccine in the course of treatment teaches the immune system to recognise attack cells
This method includes the acquisition of immune cells of patients who are subsequently modified in the laboratory
Afterwards, ‘see’ protein, which is characteristic of many forms of cancer, may be returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine that the immune system teaches to recognise the attack cells, the cancer in the ovaries has disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes acquiring the immune cells of the patient, which are modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” HER2 protein, which is significant for many forms of cancer, and then inject again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer Research from Bethesda in Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘promots the growth of several different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung and fat intestines.
A similar approach to acquiring immune cells in patients who are “taught” to target cell cancer has also worked in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West, following the SNL's appearance, made a protruding point with a letter from the MAGA to the drop.
The Society Was Not Inspired
Kanye West was excited at the Saturday Night Live performance study at a miracle point, during which he expressed support for US President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 would be a success for the President's chair.
After the third song of his performance, called "Ghost Town", during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great Again", West began with an attack on the democracies and again expressed his support for Trump.
“It often happens that I talk to a white person and he says to me, ‘How can you like Trump, because he’s a racist?’
"But if I'm concerned about racism, I should have moved away from America for a long time," he says.
This time the SNL surrender began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood player was humiliated by Brett Kavanaugh's witness before the Justice Commission in a Senate accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
The video of the West Monologue was not played, but it was uploaded to the social network by the comics Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was going to make it out of West.
West also complained to the community that he had some problems in the backyard because of writing on the drops.
"They've got me behind bars.
I was told not to go to the ore with that capo.
They've relegated me!
But they say I'm lost," said Washington Examiner's report.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see the lost scene?’ and added that you have to find ‘Superman’s border because it means that no one can show me. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments were made by the community at least twice, and the members of the SNL team were obviously upset, and someone said to Vanity: “There was a death silence in the study.”
The West recently invited a goat exchange for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West has already caused a lot of surprises with the video post for the song "I Love It", where he wore the costume of the Perrier mineral water bottle.
Westa supported Candace Turner, leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, who said, "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for being UPRL RAJI."
But Karen Hunter, the head of the conversation, insisted that West is simply "what it is, and that's all right.
However, I will not reward anyone (with the purchase of his music, the clothing or support of his "artivity") who, in my opinion, welcomes and extends the ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And we also added,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he changed his name and will then “be formally known as Kanye West. Now I am YE.”
He's not the first musician to decide to change his name. He's already done this before him, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His roommate Snoop Dogg was once named Snoop Lion, but we can't forget another musical legend: the Prince changed his name into a symbol, and then he was an Artist, once known as the Prince.
A male-indicted attempted murder because of the arrest of a person in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
The police say the event happened in Ballyhackamore.
The accused shall be brought before the Court of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by public prosecutors.
The star of the game Prestolov Kit Harington has a sharp attack on toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his campaign of match in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval-colored fantasy series of Prestolov.
A 31-year-old player who strongly condemned the stereotype of a machistic hero says that due to the appearance of such roles on screen young boys, they often feel that respect can only be earned with stamina.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that something went wrong in his opinion, and wondered how to cope with the problem of toxic manhood during #JazTudi.
The player, who recently married a 31-year-old soloist from the Rose Leslie Presto, admitted to having strong conviction about this topic.
“I’m particularly seriously wondering where we made a mistake when it came to manhood,” he said.
“What did we teach men during our upbringing about the problems we now face?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing the toxicity of man due to the display of very male characters.
He continued: “What is born again and what is taught?
What are we taught on television and on the streets to make young boys feel that they have to choose the exact amount of manhood?
I think it's one of the important issues of our time, how can we change it?
Because apparently there was something wrong with young men.”
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the series, he would not participate in the recording of any pretence or continuation of the Games of Presbyterians, because he ‘consulted with battles and horses’.
Kit will play in the main role of the new True West Sam Shepard show, which is the story of the film producer and his brother rapper.
The player recently discovered that the best thing that happened because of the game's throne was that he met his wife Rose on the video.
"Because of this series, I met my wife, so she somehow gave me my future family and life from here on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte in a fantasy series that was awarded to Emmy, a love affair of Kit's character, Jon Snow.
The couple were married in June 2018 at the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14% of new cases are reported with China
China announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In most new cases, the disease has been transmitted with sexual relations, which is a change compared to the past.
In some parts of China, HIV has usually spread rapidly as a result of a transfusion of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials, the number of people infected with HIV in the province of Junan has decreased by almost nothing.
Still, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases annually in China for 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV into the Chinese community is a very serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997 in China, but discrimination in the LGBT community is still very widespread.
As conservative values still apply in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men are reported in time with women.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate sexual protection in such situations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged general access to medicines for the treatment of HIV virus as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that staff issued data on Republican senators, condemning “hazardous lies” and “theorem theory”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters dismissed the charge on Saturday that a member of her staff published information about three American Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that these accusations came from individuals and websites on the right.
"Truths, lies, and more unforgivable lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter statement.
The published information is based on the domestic addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hatcha from Utah.
This information appeared online on Thursday, which was published by an unknown person with Capitol Hill, during a meeting of the Senate on the charges of sexual harassment of the candidate for the Supreme Judge, Bretta Kanaugh.
The information came to an end after the three senators concluded with the hearing of Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState state state that it is possible to identify through IP the source of the publication that should be linked to the office Senator Waters and to conclude that the information has been published by some of the staff, Hill reports.
“These unsubstantiated accusations are completely wrong and pure lies” continues Watersova.
“My employees whose identity, personal data and security are threatened by these false accusations are not at all responsible for the deletion of these data.
These unsubstantiated accusations are completely false and pure lies.’
Senator Waters' statement quickly ran into criticism online, including by former representative of the White House for the press, Aria Flescher.
“From this lack of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This may mean that it is not from the right test for the congress.
When you accuse someone of something he didn't do, he must not show anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the accused.
It must remain calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the fourth hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is on the way to the town of Waters in the middle of the elections, was on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's serious," he said.
Watersova stated in his statement that her cabinet had informed "the relevant institutions and prosecution authorities about these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are disclosed”, she continued, “and that they will be responsible for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for tips on Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and is also used to revive Johnny English's action comedy, which came first in 2003 with Johnny English and continued in 2011 with Johnny English 2.
Will a fun satire about how we're screwed, a new export opportunity for us?
Non-competent Johnny English, with his eyelids and unusual crimas, gets permission to re-mix the strips; his name indicates that it is a comic character created for a cinematographic audience in non-English speaking areas.
It is an ingenious secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains the part of Clouseau, Mr Beana's hamlet and the smallness of the one who contributed to the last note of the Chariots of Fire at the ceremony at the opening of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also based on the travel and international mystery that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV advertisement, leaving a real mess behind.
One or two pleasant moments are presented in the latest film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wore medieval armor, and the rotor lists were short on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly displayed, but humor seems a few mild and excessive unnecessary, especially because “real” films, like 007 or Mission, are now impossible without bad news.
It seems that humor is intended for children and not as adult viewers, so for me to deny the adventures of Johnny English is not as innovative and oriented as Atkinson does not jump into the role of Mr Bean.
The permanent theme is now obvious that Britain is in serious trouble.
The online hacker infiltrated the network of British most secret agents and revealed the identity of all British agents, causing major problems to the competent agent, represented by Kevin Eldon in an amazing little role.
This is the point of a break for the premier, a plausible figure that has already experienced a break because of political intolerance: Emma Thompson has tried to play the role of the suspect Teresa May, but there is nothing in the scenario that could help.
It shall be informed by the notifying authority that all active vacuum cleaners have been disclosed, so it must be decided upon for one of the rest of the vacuum cleaners.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a prestigious school who informally teaches how to operate undercover: here the scriptists are engaged, as English is performing some kind of Vohunska “academiejo rocka”.
They take English to Whitehall to an emergency meeting where they meet a long-term employee named Bough, who plays Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the commander of the submarine, a stereotypical sports inspiration, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
Thus Batman and Robin are prepared to create more problems on behalf of the secret service of her Highness, and meet the fatal Ophelio Bullet, who plays Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the premium is dangerous under the influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: it is the evil Jason Volt who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their retreat: dressed in a fire-fighting film in a French restaurant, create chaos when it predominates on the roof of Volt's yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for apparent reality to meet the interior of Volt's house, it succeeds in creating a general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sensitivity and energy, it refers to a child’s film.
Very average.
Like other Johnny English films, I can't help myself here and think: is the British Atkinson able to play a role that actually justifies his talent?
Labourers deny that Britain is planning a four-day work week, which would pay for a five-day work week.
The labor party, Jeremiah Corbyn, is thinking of a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive payment in five days.
The company's leading party wants the savings created by companies due to the revolution of artificial intelligence to flow to workers and allow them to have an additional day off.
So employees would enjoy a three-day weekend with the same high pay.
Viris say that the idea is in line with the customer's economic plan and the plan for the state to be set aside by workers.
The unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as it is a way for workers to benefit from the benefits of the changing economy.
A source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: 'The policy review should be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day worker is the goal that we will strive to achieve with the customer's approach to balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the customer."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party supported its four-day work week in its campaign in general elections in 2017.
This objective is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The representative of the Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not the policy of the party and the party does not think about it."
The Cancler in the shadow of John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to use the power of "the director" and "the recipient" in municipal companies.
The plans of the office in the shadow also mean that the current participants in the water companies may not be able to regain the full share, as the labor party could, on the basis of the alleged crimes, introduce ‘debts’.
He also confirmed plans to involve workers in the administrative committees and to introduce own funds, thereby transferring 10% of the share in private enterprises to employees who would receive annual dividends up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, discussed in the “60 minutes” edition whether their opinion could change the Kavanaugh investigation by the FBI.
The investigation of the complaint against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, conducted by the FBI, has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of any Republican senator’s office could be satisfied that he would withdraw his support from the judge.
In an interview held on Sunday, the author of the “60 minutes” edition of the Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI could discover anything that would change her opinion.
Kennedy felt more open to this than a colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
»I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh before the hearing began
When I called him when this charge came up, I asked him, “Did you do that?”
He was determined, without doubt,.”
Graham's voice seems to be stuck in a rock.
"I have created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would need a very convincing reason for his change," he said.
“ I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I do know that Brett definitely did, ” added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those names could confirm it.
The problem is 36 years old.
I do not see any new changes.’
What is the Global Citizen Festival and whether it has contributed to poverty reduction in any way?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual music event in which a truly exceptional type of star has the same extraordinary mission: to eliminate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place this week, will be attended by dozens of people. It will be attended by a large circuit of the Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise interest in the real purpose of the event, i.e. to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, which began in 2012, is the expansion of the Global Citizens' Project, an international provocative group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free event ticket (except if you were prepared to pay for the VIP ticket), participants had to perform a type of task or “action” such as voluntary, letter to the world leader, telephone call or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizen's move, which has remained 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them that they are demanding action, or is this just another example of the so-called ‘clickivism’ – creating a belief that people actually have a significant impact on the relationship with the signing of online petition or the distribution of debt?
The Global Citizen argues that, since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" of their supporters should be recorded in their efforts for a variety of objectives.
It says that these actions have helped global leaders to adopt commitments and policies worth more than US$ 37 billion, which is expected to affect lives by 2030.
By 2018, the group had indicated that the fruits of its 390 commitments and communications had already been paid or collected at least USD 10 billion.
The group estimates that funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, the partnership of investors and decision-makers committed to "help children realize their full potential", which Rwanda pledged US$ 35 million to help eliminate food after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the Global Citizens.
“With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can start the social crime of nutrition in the historical archive,” said Tracey Ullman, an Ambassador of the Moč Prehrane, at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions, which the United Kingdom called for improving the diet of mothers and children, the government announced that it would co-finance the Food Power project, which would reach 5 million women and children with food measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, "Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?",
the movement Global citizen replied: “This will be a long and hard path – sometimes we will fall and we will fall down.
But like a great movement for civil rights and the fight against apartheid in front of us, we will also succeed, as we are stronger together.
Some of the performers that will take place at this event in New York, are Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae. The event will lead Deborah-Lee Furness in Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use a Navy — the U.S. Ministry of the Interior to ‘block’ Russian energy exports.
American Interior Minister Ryan Zinke would have said after the Washington Examiner magazine reports that Washington could use a Navy to prevent the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, if necessary.
Zinke said Russian mediation in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of the legitimate government) is an excuse for investigating new energy markets.
"I believe that there is a reason for their presence in the Middle East to want to market energy, as they market it in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe," I would say.
In the opinion of the officials, however, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can fly this way. The Navy ensures that our maritime routes are open and, if necessary, block them, preventing Russian energy from reaching the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event hosted by the Energy Union, a non-profit group known as the US voice of energy consumers.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, warning that it was actually the same.
‘As regards Iran and Russia, the economic potential is more or less of a fuel impact and their replacement,’ he said, marking Russia as ‘a pony that knows one trick’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements were made at a time when Trump's administration is trying to increase exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, where it is expected to exacerbate Russia, which is a significantly cheaper choice for European consumers.
For this purpose, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany that it would reject the ‘improportional’ North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which would lead to the ‘Talker’ of Moscow after Trump Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth USD 11 billion, which is intended to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, except for the economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that this is an unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we have the same view that energy must not be a pressure-based tool and that consumers must have the right to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with the US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
Germany rejected the US position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Organisation, the German Industry Association (BDI), has called for the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“Interference of a third country in our energy supply means a great deal of trouble for me,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "examine his candidacy for the US President in 2020," says the Massachusetts Senator.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would "research" her candidacy for the US President after the interim elections.
In the city house in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would think about the candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman’s leader,” The Hill reported.
"After 6 November, I will study my candidacy for the President in detail."
Warren was building President Donald Trump at a meeting in the city house, because "this country should lead in the wrong direction."
“What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, I’m worried about,” she said.
Warren Trump and the candidate for the President of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanauga has been criticised several times openly.
In a statement published on Friday, Warren said, "Of course before the elections we need an FBI investigation."
The poll published on Thursday showed that most of its own voters believe that Warren should not compete for the presidency in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk Political Research Centre/Boston Globe, the senator should not run for the president, eight-hundred percent of the "probably" voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty-three percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed that the former governor, Deval Patrick, had greater support for the candidacy, with 38 per cent of the respondents supporting it, and 48 per cent opposed it.
Other high-level democracies that would be considered as a candidate for the 2020 elections are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Poorly after the report of the Associated Press, he said he would decide officially by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned a post-traumatic stress disorder in support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, survived a year of military registration in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with family violence
“When my own son, who experiences his return, connects me with other families that are dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain level of injury that our soldiers are returning with,” told the community at a meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palinov's son's arrest was marked as "a elephant in the salon" and said that her son and other military veterans were returning a few changed, hardened, wondering where respect for what their comrades and refugees and all the other members of the army were giving to the State."
The track Palina was arrested on Monday in Wasilla in Alaska and charged with violence in the family with assault on women, opposition to the application of violence in the family and possession of weapons in the guilty state, said Dan Bennett, a representative of the police station in Wasilli.
18 United States and the Colombian District support the rejection of a new asylum policy
Eighteen United States and the Colombian District support the legal rejection of the new American policy, which rejects the right to asylum for victims who flee from violence or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the area mentioned had completed a court case on Friday to support the legal rejection of the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was filed by the American Association for Civil Liberties v. Federal Policy, has not been published.
She said that her partner and “his violent sons, members of the crowd” abused her, but on July 20th, the American authorities rejected her asylum claim.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors of the states that support Grace are Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which many asylum applications come in the United States have been described as countries that constantly face problems with domestic violence and torture.
In 2014, the new U.S. asylum policy repealed the decision of the Committee on Immigrant Invitations, which was made available to unregistered immigrants fleeing family violence, enabling the application for asylum to be lodged.
National Prosecutor of the District of Columbia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "respects the decades of state, federal and international law."
‘Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be judged on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application, while such a prohibition violates this principle,’ the application submitted to the court.
State prosecutors have further stated in the request that the policy that the immigrants deny the right to entry is damaging to the US economy, as it is likely that they will become entrepreneurs and that they will "provide the necessary labour force".
The General Prosecutor of State Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to grant any more asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and violence in June.
“Assil is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in their policy publication on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems people face every day throughout the world.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but there are desperate attempts to save lives
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The feeling is very tense,” said a 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma when she comforted her hot boy in the evacuation center in a divided town of Pala.
"The saviors constantly import bodies.
It lacks clean water.’
It seemed to be a city, returning to ruined homes that had been swept through the crowded things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people and hospitals were injured, destroyed by a 7.5 earthquake, were overloaded.
Some injured, including Two Haris, who suffered back and shoulder injury, were restless in a military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated on a free basis because of the constant excrement of the sun.
When he mentioned the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was made up of his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
"There was no time to get rid of it.
I think I was pushed against the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press agency. He added that he was with his family in town for the sake of marriage.
"I heard a woman calling for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of “debt” with “propaganda ads”
One week after the publication of the four - page announcement of the official Chinese magazine in the US daily, which praised the mutual benefit of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China Beijing accused the abuse of the US press for the spread of propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last week mentioned a paid supplement of China Daily Officer Des Moines Register – the most sold magazine in the U.S. state of Iowa, after China accused interference in the US Congress elections on 6 November, which China denied.
The Agency Reuters reported that US federal officials have charged Trump with trying to interfere with the American federal election, describing as a new phase in Washington's increasingly intense efforts to press China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an increasingly intense trade war in which you exchange hits by introducing customs on import products.
The Chinese refund rates at the start of the trade war were intended to harm exporters in the USA, such as Iowa, which is supported by Trump’s Republican Party, by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former long-term governor Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing had been affected by American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of Officer Des Moines Register, "now this charge doubles by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
“In expanding the propaganda, the Chinese government has used the American Free Speech and Free Print tradition to publish a paid ad in the official Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions in the Beijing newspapers and no real reflections of the diversity of opinions that Chinese citizens have about the worrying Chinese economic path, since the municipality is strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese magazines has rejected the offer of publication” of his article, although he did not indicate which.
The Republicans lose voters before the interim elections with the Kavanaugh puzzle, the analysts warn
Analysts note that the support of many of the most important republics supporting and defending the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual assault, will be known to the upcoming interim elections with the loss of elections.
The feelings here are extremely high, but most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at Maxwell University College in Siracuzah for an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI would be enough to calm the angry voters lately.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it either tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progress group MoveOn, on Friday, following the report of Officer Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang ‘November is coming!’ when they demonstrated in the corridor of the Senate when the Republicans, who are overseeing the judicial committee, decided to further support Kavanaugh's nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, reported the news portal Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond all borders,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-participating political analyst.
"People say they're strong now, and that's what it's holding.
But it could be even stronger, especially among undiminished voters in suburbs and smaller voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not like the President, but do not like often.’
Even before a public witness to Ford, in which she detailed her allegations of the sexual assault of the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts said that further Republican support could have a negative impact.
“This has become a major confusion for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Council, following the NBC News report in the beginning of last week.
"It is not only the vote of the Council or the final vote of Kavanaugh's vote; it is also the way the Republicans agree with it and the way they dealt with Fordovo," Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities Group of the United States, told the television channel that supports the Democrats in the elections.
But the Americans seem to be a few divided among them, or more likely to believe in the testimony of Ford or Kavanauga, with a few more support from the latter.
The new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents are sure or most likely to believe the testimony of Ford, and 35% said they are sure or most likely to believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they believed that Kavanaugh probably lied during the witness, and only 30 percent said so about Ford.
Following the pressure from FBA, the FLA is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported by The Guardian.
Ford's last week before the Senate's courtroom, under oath, Kavanaugh, when he was 17 years old, attacked her in a guilty state.
Ramirez's claim that she was a high court candidate who showed her sex when they were together at the party during their study at Yale University in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the world’s Internet, opens up a start company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners Open-Cod solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee complained that the purpose of Inrupt was to "get over the world".
“We decided to do this now,” said the new company.
"Games for a moment of history."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create a ‘personal storage storage’ or a POD
This may include contact details, mailing lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
The specificity of the personal data storage facility is that the user can fully determine who can access the information.
This is what the company calls "personal data-reliance".
Executive Director John Bruce says the company's idea is to pool resources, processes and appropriate skills that will allow solid platforms to be accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers for work on the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
Already this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group "with Facebook and Google are not talking about whether they could introduce a complete change that could eliminate all their business models overnight."
"We don't ask for permission."
In a Saturday publication on the Media portal, Berners-Lee wrote that the purpose of Inrupt is "to ensure commercial energy and the ecosystem for the protection of the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet with the establishment of the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Berners-Lee will also remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Institute of Open Data.
"As for the next time, I am extremely optimistic," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The celebration of the Victorian Cross from World War I
In the home city for 100 years, the division of the Victorian cross to the only minister of the English church who had won it as a fighter in the first world war has been celebrated.
Col. Bernard Vann earned his confession on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, though, he was shot by a gunman, and he never learned that he had been given this highest British military honor.
On Saturday at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two Colonel's grandson discovered a monumental stone.
One of the lawyers, Michael Vann, said it was “extremely symbolic” that they discovered the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s act, with which he earned his distinction.
According to officer London Gazette, Colonel Vann, on September 29, 1918, led his battalion through the Canal of Saint Quintina, "scattered a very dense fog and under a strong fire of battlefields and machinery."
Later, he planned against the shooting line and with the "most hero" he led the line, and then I attacked the machine and struck three members of the squad.
Colonel Vanna was shot by a German sharpsman on 4 October 2018 – only a good month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of the old father were “something I know and could never achieve, so teach me humility.”
With Dr. James Vanna's brother, they put a wedding ring on the parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be able to participate in this paradise” and “that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that will be expressed by many people.”
Enthusiasts of mixed martial arts slept all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they were responsible for Puise Pepe.
Imagine: You've been praying all night to watch the completely sold Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose covered 13 debates, including six in the main park, and it was carried alive in the United Kingdom on the fifth channel.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mouusas and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a meeting, the audience in the United Kingdom was shocked to find that the transmission had been replaced by the performance of the drawing of Puys Pepa.
Marsikdo was not very excited because he remained up until morning just because of the fight.
One of the fans described on Twitter a child’s picture curse as “a kind of painful joke”.
‘In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a child programme,’ said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of Bellator for marketing and communication when asked about the transfer.
"Pepa's trust.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule so that future audiences in the United Kingdom would also be included.
"When I think about playing again, I think they could do it," Coker said.
“Then there's six o'clock in the morning Sunday, and we won't be able to arrange this until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, many messages were exchanged at the turn and not all were friendly.
We tried to arrange the task; we assumed it was only a technical mistake.
However, there was a real reason for the government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again the next time.
Instead of six, we will carry five doubts — as usual — and we tried to offer the worshipers more than we expected and saved ourselves.
It is a very unappreciative situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "deserved" about sexuality.
Tom Daley, an Olympic swimmer, said that because of his sexual orientation, he felt inferior from everyone — but it gave him a motivation for success.
The 24-year-old said he knew that “not every one of them” as he was, when he entered high school.
Speaking at the first edition of Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4 radio station, he said he spoke about gay rights to give another "hope".
He also said that when he became a parent, he had reduced his desire to win the Olympics.
The regular nurse, Kirsty Young, has been absent for several months.
Daley, who appeared as an outsider in Laverne's first edition, said he felt "less worth" than everyone else, because "it was not socially acceptable to have boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, these feelings of indivisibility and diversity are a real thing that gives me the power and endurance to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said that he would not disappoint anyone who would finally learn about his direction.
Twice the bronze Olympic competitor became an influential advocate of LGBT law and appeared twice this year at the Games of the Communities of the Nations in Australia in order to invite countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy, that he could speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said he was a novelist with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, with whom he met in 2013 – “presented.”
Daley and the winner of the survey, who is 20 years older than him, reported last year, but says that the difference in years never meant problems.
“When you are so young” – at the age of 14, he attended the first Olympic games, and three years later his father died – he said, it was hard to find someone of the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.
A couple of June adopted a child, son of Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that this changed his "full view".
“If I were asked last year, everything I would have to say would be “to achieve a gold medal”, he said.
"But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets to London in 2012, because he wanted to sit in the first row.
I couldn't tell him, "This time you won't be in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and even when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I had to finally admit that he was not invulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and achieved a bronze medal.
“I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to dive into the Olympics before the home community. There was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first selection of songs – The Water Music Library Heather Small, which followed him in the preparations for the Olympics and at which he still wears his skin.
The Desert Island Disks play at BBC Radio 4 every week at 11.15 (BST).
Unprepared Mikkelson was the president of Ryder on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will be on Sunday, playing his 47th game in Ryder's fall, setting up a record, but he'll have to go back in shape so that it won't become an accident border.
Mikkelsson, who will participate in the biennial event of the 12th record, left Captain Fury sitting on Saturdays.
Instead of being at the centre of the event as often as it was for the United States, a five-time winner spent part of the day as a fan and part of the improvement of his games in order to fix what he was trying to do.
Given that even at the top of the career, the 48-year-old does not match the best narrow game Le Golf National, where the long ice inevitably punishs the wrong hits.
And if only the game wasn't scary enough, Mikkelson would have dealt with the British Open Francescom Molinari on Sunday in the ninth game this week, which in the race to win all four games linked to the newsman Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who at the beginning of the 12 games had four less games, had a good start, the Mikkelson game could be a decisive one.
Fury expressed his trust in his man, but he didn't say much.
“He fully understands the role he played today, he beat me on his back and hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Fury said.
"There's a lot of trust in you.
He is one of the famous and has contributed exceptionally to the teams in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it went and we thought it should be done.
He wants to play, just like everyone."
Mikkelson will record Nick Falda on Sunday for the biggest number of games played in the fall Ryder Cup.
This could mark the conclusion of Ryder's career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mikkelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven equations, but Fury said that his presence in the team also brings some unfavourable benefits.
“It’s fun, sarcastic, funny, it’s the work of fools from people and it’s wonderful to have it in the crew room,” he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun when they moved this week with him, what it was fun to see."
It gives much more than just a game.’
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon be gained
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride at the start of the last day of the game for individuals in Ryder's fall.
Young Danec debuted in 1997 at the Valderrama game, where the side of which the captain was Seve Ballesteros had five points of advantage in front of the Americans, but through the goal it had only a priority for the hair, with a result of 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"Don't forget that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderram where we won, but hardly," said Bjorn (on the picture) after watching the team Class of 2018, who won with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and told at the game Le Golf National said with 10-6.
So history tells me and everyone on the team that the kiss isn't over yet.
Play the full-time tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you need to do.
It's not over until it's like that on the table.
We have the goal of winning this ball, and we have to stay focused on it.
All the time he says that I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know very well who is on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, excited about the game of his players in the challenging game, added: "I would never have hurried here.
Tomorrow's gonna be a different day.
Tomorrow will be the front game of individuals, so it will have to be fought differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things go well, and when you're there alone, your skills are tested to the end.
This is a message you need to convey to players: Tomorrow you need to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind and he must get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Fury will encourage his players to play better than their partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have reached three points of four.
Fury himself was on both sides of the revolution in the last day, as he was part of the victory team in Brookline before he ended up as a winner when Europe carried out the "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every surprised word,” he was answered when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, told his players in the final day of the game.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we would like to start as fast as we saw in Brookline as we saw in Medina.
When that start gets the stamina, it's a lot of pressure on middle-class games.
We created the right setting and put the boys in a way until we felt that we would do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned to try to lead a battle and meet Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“In this group of boys, I decided on this order, because I think it covers the whole schedule,” Bjorn said about the choice of individuals.
New German warship suspended again
The latest frigate of German sailors should be handed over in 2014 in order to replace the old warships from the cold war, but the local authorities have reported as a result of a system failure and a rapid increase in costs by the next year.
==References====External links==*Reinland-Pfalz==References====External links==
The fleet should join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project raises worrying questions after delivery.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, commissioned in 2007, will replace the senior class of Bremen frigate.
It is expected that they will have a strong top, a type of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles and some cover technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer intervals between maintenance – the latest frigates should be able to stay outside the home port for up to two years.
The constant delay, however, means that the top military ships, which are intended to enable Germany to have an impact on the sea by its own power, have already become obsolete until the start of use, says Officer Die Zeet.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time that a sailor returned the ship to the ship after delivery.
The reasons for the return are only known, and the German municipalities have identified a number of key "programme and technical deficiencies" which would make the warship useless if it was to be sent to a military mission.
The lack of software was particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will run a crew with about 120 sailors – only half of the working force on the older frgates of Bremen.
It has also proved to be a very heavy burden on the ship, which reduces its capacity and limits the marine possibilities for its future upgrade.
The 700-ton ship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ should be twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans in the second world war.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the whole project has also become a problem – including training the crew.
This is expected to reach EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) from the initial EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the power of the sea will be reduced by Germany.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that the sailors were in fact "decreasing ships suitable for travel."
The official said that the issue was gradually intensified because the old ships had broken down, and replacement vessels were not provided.
He complained that sailors could not join any Baden-Wuerttemberg ships.
The National Fund Listens to the Secret Life of Netopians
A new research is being carried out at the Scottish High Council, which seeks to discover how bats use food in food hunting.
They hope that the results will re-enlighten the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to direct future conservation activities.
In the research, scientists from the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small nettles and small nettles and fish catch nettles and surrounding nettles at Inverewe Gardens in the Wester Ross area.
They will set up special recorders at key locations to monitor the activities of netopiers throughout the whole season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will confirm the frequency of calls of netopers and what kind of action they are doing.
They will then prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, the NTS conservation consultant, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most suitable for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as the creation of lawns and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of netizens in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting shelters and habitat loss.
The risk also represents wind turbines and lighting, as well as mussels and certain types of chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats aren't actually blind.
Because of nighttime fishing habits, they help themselves more with their ears than with their eyes.
A refined echolocation technique shall be used to accurately identify errors and obstacles on the way to the year.
NTS, which is responsible for providing more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land by country, does not take it very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, security checks and temporary solutions.
The organization at the property of Thrave in the Dumfries and Galloway area has set up even the first and for now the only Scottish reservation, specifically for non-stop.
The manager of David Thompson's possession says it's an ideal territory for them.
"We have an excellent area in Thrava for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all quality habitats.
However, there is still a great deal of knowledge about bats, so the work we are doing here and in other properties will help us to better understand what they need in order to succeed."
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of netopers before performing maintenance work on holdings, as possibly unintentional destruction of one single netopers relative could lead to death of up to 400 males and adolescents, which could mean the loss of the entire local population.
It is therefore prohibited to kill, harass or disturb the non-smokers, and it is also prohibited to destroy their relatives.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Netopian Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: "We still have to learn a lot about our bats and for many species we just don't know how well their populations are holding."
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of rape, and lawyers prepare for the German trial
Cristiano Ronaldo pointed out that he had been accused of a rape that was to be committed and that people wanted to “promot themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing for a German press release with Der Spiegel, who has published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker charged that in 2009 the hotel room in Las Vegas strengthened the American named Kathryn Mayorg.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay her $375.000 for the silent event.
In a bid of 142 million followers in Instagram Live video several hours after reporting, Ronaldo, 33, marked the report as "false news"
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was false news," the gold ball winner said in the camera five times.
"By using my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I am a happy man and I want good for everyone," the player added a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing for the Der Spiegel report on the allegations that they have been referred to as "an unacceptable report on suspicion of private life".
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for “indemnity damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The event is expected to take place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
In the documentation submitted to the District Court of Clark in Nevada, after a meeting at the Mayorg club with Ronald, she should return to the player's room, and this should be an analytical step up there.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after that event and told her that he is “99-percent good man”, which disappoints only in “one percent”.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed sexual relations, but described it as an agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photographs of her injuries were recorded in the hospital, and later she agreed on an extra-judicial settlement because there was a “fear-warning ball” and was cared for by “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old claims that he wants to cancel the settlement, because he still has a serious injury due to the alleged event.
Ronaldo was just prior to the attack from Real Madrid in Manchester United, and this summer, according to an agreement, worth 100 million dollars, moved to the Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: United Kingdom would “appreciate forever” the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would “deplorable forever” if it were to lose the status of the leading world car manufacturer after the break, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was 'anxious' that Toyota UK told the BBC that the withdrawal from the EU of Great Britain would temporarily suspend production in the factory in Burnaston near Derby without an agreement.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the delay on the border in the case of a break without an agreement could lead to loss of jobs.
Toyota Auris and Avensis produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that in the event of Britain leaving the European Union without agreement at the end of March, production in our factory would stop," said Marvin Cooke, Toyotin's Managing Director at the Burnston factory.
Concerns about how the outcome of the European Union without agreement will affect cross-border trade have also been expressed by other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit in a month, she would close her factory Mini in Oxford.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of a breakage.
Toyota's production line operates in accordance with the principle of "at the right time", with the delivery of supplies from the United Kingdom and the EU coming every 37 minutes for cars on order.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom from the EU failed to agree, this could result in an disturbance at the borders for which representatives of the Panoga say they could cause a halt and a lack of work.
Toyota, in its factory in Derbyshire, could not coordinate for more than one day, said representatives of the company, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Therese May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely moderated to avoid such border checks".
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the present success, but to seize this opportunity," said Today BBC Radio 4.
"The data not only toyote, but also other manufacturers are that we must be absolutely able to continue a highly successful supply chain."
Toyota could not comment on how long the production would have been stopped, but warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in the factory for 24 years and is the founder of the United States trade union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "After my experience, the lost job never returns."
The government representative said: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be interrupted again, says the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with the deputy prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could, due to the ongoing struggle with the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugha, "stop for another week", the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is studying Russian pre-emptive interference, the relationship between Trump's employees and Russia, and the potential impoverishment of the judiciary by the President.
The question is whether Trump, an envoy of the Attorney General, will forgive and threaten Mueller's independence, has been fueling Washington's speech for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a hearing machine to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president on the basis of Amendment 25.
Rosenstein's missing the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House in the middle of a report on his intention to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations Conference in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trump said that Rosenstein would not forgive, and then the meeting was held to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual conduct, Dr Ford.
On Friday, Trump identified a one-week investigation of the charges against Kavanauga, which further postponed the Senate's vote.
Trump's press representative, Sarah Sanders, appeared in Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date for it is not yet fixed. It could happen this week, depending on everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court, and it could be postponed for another week.
We'll see. I always want to make sure you're informed."
Some reporters would argue that Sanders never called the White House meeting with reporters since September 10th.
The director of the show Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sandersova said that the frequency of meetings is not going to attribute resistance to the "setting up" of TV reporters, but she said, "You couldn't deny it to be set up."
Then she mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The President holds more press conferences than any president before him,” she said, adding without mentioning the source: “We have seen the numbers.”
Meetings will still take place," Sanders said. "But if journalists can turn directly to the President of the United States with their question, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to make it possible and you have seen that we have done this frequently in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference that you can talk to the President of the United States."
The Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with the public at the guests.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when he came to the newsroom, he was kind and kind of bizarre.
Letter from the Minister of Health to EU workers in NHS Scotland concerning the fear of brexity
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and the desire to continue the work after the break.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom came out of the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying the costs of applying to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "If in the summer the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued on the outcome, when I approach the decision this fall.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also accelerated preparations for a possible outcome scenario without an agreement.
I know it has to be all your time of great concern.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from all over the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
In Scotland you can feel completely at home. We want you to stay here very much.”
Christion Abercrombie urgently operated after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, has stopped an emergency operation by the Vanderbilt Commodores team, reported Mike Organ of The Tennessean magazine.
The chief coach of the State University of Tennessee told reporters that the injury occurred only half a time ago.
“He came to the edge of the game, and he just got a little confused there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the toy before placing it on the toy and taking it from the toy for further inspection.
An official from the State University of Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering after surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘the details of the type/range of the injury are not yet known’ and that the Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently a hero at the university, plays for the Tennessee State University for the first time since the transition from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five hits together before he left the game, and his total number of hits in the season rose to 18 hits.
A higher tax will be charged on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
A higher fee will be charged on the purchase of real estate by foreign customers in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people in new plans
The move will neutralize Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
Increased taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The depositary expects her to raise up to 120 million pounds a year, and she'll appoint them to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher rate of tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and the collected money will be paid to the homeless, today will be reported by Theresa May.
The move needs to be understood as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to increase the taxation of high-income people.
The increased tax will be charged to persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and will encourage the government's efforts to eliminate unemployment.
The yield, which will be charged in addition to the current amount, including the increased levels, which were introduced two years ago for other homes and real estate for delivery, could be nothing less than three percentages.
The depositary expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year by the adoption of the measure.
According to estimates, non-staters of the United Kingdom are expected to buy 13 percent of newly built London property, resulting in a high price and a heavier purchase of first property.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the main city, have become ‘the places of the spirit’, as the number of customers who spend most of their time away from the country is increasing.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the amount of money to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
A large construction company accused of increasing prices with a country that is not actually used, but Mr. Mayevo called for a discount on the price-accessible housing quotas in order to correct the British "composition shame".
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the monitoring of rents and the completion of forced displacements without mistake.
In addition, he wants to give the city world more authority to build new homes.
Ms. Mayeva said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime leadership to the restoration of British dreams – that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means repairing our non-working housing market.
The Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
But it can't be right that for people who don't live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies to buy homes is as simple as for the British citizens of the garage.
For too many people the dream of their own home is all too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains all too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to run the Scotland Club"
Chief Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is once to become the manager of the Scotland Club.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the challenge of the North-East Club, which currently holds the third place in the First League, with three points less than the first-class.
At the Light Stadium, he moved this summer, after St. Mirren took back to the Scottish Championship in the last season.
"For my country, I wanted to play as a player.
I took the B chapter, and that's what Ross said about the BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
“But I grew up observing Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that drew me back.
This opportunity would be offered only if it was successful in running a club."
Ross' predecessors were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Alloa Athletic team, who had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, said that as an heir to such great names he had no fear.
“The success of me is measured by the question “Can I bring this club back to the League?”
In view of the structure and capabilities of this club, the club is undoubtedly part of the First League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but it’d probably be a success only if the club could get there again.”
Ross is doing the manager's work for only three years after he was the assistant manager in Dumbarton and for 15 months part of the hearts training staff.
Alloi then helped to prevent the third league exit, and St. Mirren brought out the title of the championship championship in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real break”, he mentioned taking Alloe.
“I was really convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It's funny to hear because it was a good player, so I've had a relatively good experience, and I've also achieved some more success.
But the game can become challenging.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still face stress and pressure at work, but I just feel like the right thing for myself.
I've always wanted to run a club and now I'm doing it. In my skin, I now feel more comfortable in my entire adult life.”

The summer heat increased the income of heavy-duty British pubs, but also increased the pressure on chain restaurants.
In July, groups of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 per cent, but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, the business adviser of the CGA, who prepared the data, said: “The constant solar time and participation of England in the world collapse, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern as in June last month, when the income of the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were affected even stronger.
The decline in transport in restaurants by 1.8% in June has increased in July.
Changes in pubs and bars with drinks increased more in comparison to each other than traffic in restaurants decreased.
The sun has also reduced sales in pubs that offer food in particular, but not as dramatic as in restaurant managers.
Looks like people just wanted to go to a drink.
In the various pubs and bars, the sales of the drink increased by 6.6% in one month and the sales of food decreased by three percentage points.’
Paul Newman, from a group of free time analysts and hospitality RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The market in hospitality remains the largest factor in the time and impact of major social or sports events.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the decline of 4.8 per cent at the Mediterranean level will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
For locals with food long-term hot summers, it would not be possible to arrive at the worst time and only time will tell if recovery will be necessary to bring more moderate temperatures that we have experienced in August."
The total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2,7 % in July, indicating the slow introduction of trade marks.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the criterion for sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 business groups with a total traffic of more than 9 billion pounds and is implemented by an industrial reference.
One of the five children has a secret account on the social network hidden from parents
Research has shown that one of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years of age — has a secret account on the social network that is hidden from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 slides showed the growth of fake Instagram pages
News reinforces fears of publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a “main” account for parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years of age, is actually on social networks the account he hides from his parents.
A survey of 20,000 people showed rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news reinforced fears of the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of dijacs have said that they manage the censored “main” account shown to parents and also have private accounts.
The mother, who accidentally ran into a 13-year-old girl's hidden side, noticed that her daughter invited visitors to her place.
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK network and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them recognise that they have a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are being tempted and create a web space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be an ‘Athletic voice’ on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Elid Doyle was appointed to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director of the annual General Assembly of the Administrative Committee.
Doyle is the most distinguished Scottish athletes on the ground and on the loose, and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who focus on sports to take advantage of its extensive experience at international level in the last decade.
“Eilid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community. We are confident that an athlete in Scotland with her involvement in the committee will gain enormously,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm delighted to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help with sports in Scotland."
The American , who won over 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta from the total of four Olympic medals, is now a regular commentator for BBC, has been unable to speak after a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: "A month ago, I was hit by a drop.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said he'd only tell me if I could recover and to what extent.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again and I'm running agility exercises today!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!’
An advertisement for a breast pump comparing the mother to cows divided online opinions
The company producing the breast pump has divided opinions with an advertising that compares the mother to the cows in the mill.
For the start of the marketing of ‘the first silent portable breast pump’, Elvie has published a provocative music video to show mothers all the freedom they can afford.
Four true mothers dance in the sheep's company, filled with hay, on a song that includes the following words: "Yes, I do, but there is no tail," and "If you haven't noticed, these are not my cuts, these are my tits."
The sample goes on to say, "Exhale, drain, feed the baby, drain, drain, crush the breast."
But the ad, published on Facebook's website, has caused considerable abuse on the Internet.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, he received mixed reactions from the viewers, many of whom said that he was joking about the “mass” of the dairy industry.
"The use of the charge for advertising this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they are pregnant and pregnant to produce milk, but their children are already stealing them in the first days after the slaughter,” wrote one.
The breast pump Elvie is discreetly attached to breast-feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Of course it is traumatic for both mother and young man.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers holding their children?’
Someone else added: "A voice completely without feeling."
Others praised the ad, and one of the women admitted that she seemed to be a song "to blackish".
"That seems like a great idea.
I'd buy it, too, if I'd still breast-feed.
I felt like a cow at the time.
The ad is a few crazy, but I understood it, as it was thought.
It's a brilliant product," said the other.
Someone commented: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who drain their milk (usually at the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an ad that would praise or condemn the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they were dancing with cricket pumps in the dark.
The concept of action is that many women who are breast-feeding say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, has no wire or tube and is discreetly attached to breast-feeding, which allows women to move, hold a child, and even activities on the free during milking.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD in mothers, continued to comment. "Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a bold and provocative presentation."
With the flow of the parallel between the women who are sucking milk, and the cows milkers, we wanted to pay attention to the burning of the milk and all its challenges, and at that time in a fun way that women can connect with, show an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump came to the headlines.
During the London week of fashion, the mother of two children walked on the Meneken road for the designer Marto Jakubowski when she used the product.
Hundreds of children of silent migrants moved to a tent camp at the Texas border
The number of detained children of migrants has risen significantly, even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the grave rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump’s administration have made it difficult for children to hand over to sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid to be able to stay in the country with a child's request.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities reported that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to hand out fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Agency, spoke before the congress about arresting more than ten people who were asked to sponsor young people without leave.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal records.
"Approximately 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or domestic sponsors are illegal in the country, and much of them are punishable by foreigners.
That is why we continue to search for these individuals," Mr Albence said.
With a view to speeding up the treatment of children, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within one month after they were detained, and not after 60 days, which was the previous standard, the workers in the camp told them.
Many will show up with videoconferencing, not personal, in order to defend themselves against the immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for aid will be quickly eliminated.
As long as children are in custody, they are more likely to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent explosions or escape attempts following the statements of workers in shelters and reports that have occurred in the system in recent months.
Protesters have said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornill, where the signs of child stress because of their size are more likely to remain undetected.
They added that moving children to a tent town could not be emotionally prepared or given the opportunity to speak to friends, complicated the trauma that many of them face.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In an argument with the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moual of Syria called for the return of home, even though the war had already taken place in the country for eight years.
Moual, who also carries out the duties of Prime Minister's deputy, said that foreign forces on the Syrian soil were illegal, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they would "be treated accordingly".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” the congregation said.
Moualem said that the "war against terrorism" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, and millions had to leave home, " almost finished".
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this world battle until we clear the Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
In Syria, the United Nations has about 2,000 soldiers who train and advise the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Al Asad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of this state in the war-breaked state.
With regard to the refugees, Mouale said that the conditions for them were appropriate for return, and he blamed “some Western countries” for “the spread of unreasonable fears” which convinced refugees to stay abroad.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to their easier return," he said.
"The political issue is changing, which should be the only humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have assured Syria that it will not receive renewable resources until Asad and the opposition reach agreement on the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a Tampon zone in the last important rebel rebellion, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented the extensive attack of the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that he had an agreement on a clear deadline, and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the Nursra Front, associated with Al-Qaida, who would be "rooted".
Ambassador of the United Nations, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that he will soon call for the first meeting of a new committee composed by government and opposition members to prepare a proper constitution for Syria and press the way to the election.
Mouale defined the conditions of the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited to "in the review of the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will reach second term
After this conclusion, Mr Trump will win again in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to hope, his presidency will soon end with questioning and scandal.
What would no doubt be "the most dramatic presidential finals at any time!"
For now there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, CNN’s visibility has been more than doubled to 1.05 million at the time of the largest viewing, while MSNBC’s visibility has grown to almost 1.6 million.
The Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers, more than four years ago, after Nielsen, when it had 1.7 million, "The Rachel Maddow Show" on the MSNBC channel reached the highest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers at night of important news.
“It is a fire that attracts people because it is something we do not understand,” said Neal Baer, the director of the drama “Designed Survivor” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known poet comedy and author of the book “Only funny parts: and a few strong truths about worship at the Club of Hollywood Boys,” offers a different explanation.
Remember the taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd like Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘He who makes me laugh,’ she told me.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what is seen on television, Washington's story could decide on the future of the Roe anti-Wad case, given whether immigrant families can reunite and health of the global economy.
The hatch is a luxury that can only be afforded by the most privileged viewers.
Nevertheless, the sixth look of the round table of experts discussing the use of a source “out of the deep back” for the book “Strah” Bob Woodward, $15,000 worth of jackets from the new mouth (“wear, heavy with a blow,” The Washington Post said) and the consequences of shocking descriptions of Trump, khm, anatomy.
Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Maria again.
“Part of his start, which inspires the impression of reality, is that he offers something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the “Pawn Stars” show on the composition of Trump's show and day-to-day screenplay (dating with N.F.L., praise Kim Jong Una).

When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, there were 80 degrees (26.7 °C) outside his home on the northern coast of Kauaija, but he was forgotten to watch the MSNBC when he recorded CNN.
He could not stand down, nor could he stand up when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the air.
“I remember when we created all these crazy plays and people said, ‘This is the end of Western civilization’,” Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

External money is available in preparation for the most difficult interim elections
It is not surprising that in the 17th Pennsylvania district, a flood of money was observed, as two candidates were in the same race for the same seat due to the reorganization of the congress districts.
This recently divided into a newly divided suburb of Pittsburgh is the home of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat at the special elections this spring in another district.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which is heavily covered with the new 17 district.
The cards were re-enacted when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of January ruled that the old districts had been re-enacted in favour of the republics.
The theme of the new 17th round touched on the fight to finance the campaign between the main foreign financial bodies, the Congressional Committee for Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a wide-ranging March special elections for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political commentators attribute a slight advantage to democrats.
In the United States, they considered sanctions against Salvador because of China’s support, and then withdrew.
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Panam Juan Carlos Varelo in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until the partners lost the leadership of Trump's organization.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to resign US leaders of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to "soon decisions to stop Taiwan's recognition", said Heather Nauert, a representative of the Ministry at the beginning of the month.
However, they considered sanctions against Salvador, which was expected to receive US$ 140 million in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included the limitation of financial aid and the targeted restriction on the issue of visas, would severely affect this Central American country with large unemployment and number of murders.
During internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development, which would continue the same meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, the top government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, thus concluding their thoughts on the sentences for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now responsible for addressing the conference participants, which is now planned for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance that the US government assigns to the meeting.
After that, three American envoys returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss them on an anonymous basis.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the government and spoke about it under the terms of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of the judiciary, which is now in public records of a great deal of evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also point out whether Mr. Trump's campaign was involved with Russia in the attack on American elections.
If the congress is to change its hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer to the authorities before the jury of his colleagues just as soon as he prepares to speak to his electors again.
There are many questions here and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor do his fellow Members in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long we could be fighting.
In 1938, German officials were ready to launch a strike against Hitler if the West supported him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We did not succeed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the worship that followed.
The course of history is changing on such crossings and speeds up or impedes the unexplained path of democracy.
The Americans are dealing with several of these breakthroughs right now.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump forgives Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a hurry since this officer reported that he proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated about his incompatibility with this situation.
Mr. Rosenstein said the report of Officer The Times was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the requested FBI inquiry by Brett Kavanaugh is not exhausted or honest or if it is appointed as the Supreme Judge in spite of credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the interim elections for a congress that will require responsibility for Mr. Trump?
If we're going to get down on these tests, long-lived democracy is waiting for us.
But I'm sure it won't do us any good because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovenian Jew who deported her to Auschwitz with the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she ordered me to burn the sabbatical candles on the table with the candles.
How could it not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimized before facing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and it is clear that they will be won over the Austrians after an impressive campaign against Villarrela in Spain at the beginning of this month in a convincing position to qualify from the Group of the European League.
The knee injury to the related player Graham Dorrans prevented him from appearing in the season for the first time before a 2:2 showdown against Villarrela, but he believes that Rangers can use it as a jumper for greater achievements.
“It was a worthy point for us because Villarreal is a strong team,” said a 31-year-old.
"We have entered the game to make sure that we can achieve something and take the point.
We might be able to win at the end, but the overall score is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and we were better off in the second half.
There will be another great European night on Thursday.
We hope we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure with a lot of us that we can try and achieve a positive result.
Last year it has certainly been difficult, given all that has happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I now have a good feeling about this place.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope that we can continue now, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Poor Sleeping of Women for Fear of Savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, only a few people talk to their family members about it.
Half of the respondents to the Nationalwide insurance investigation said they talked to the spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent told them to talk to their children about it.
“People want a family member to worry about them, but they don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the Life Insurance Sector at the National Wide Insurance Center.
You can start the next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: Families can't prepare for you if you don't talk to her on time.
Talk to the counselor and the family about where and how you want to get care, as this can be an important factor in assessing the cost.
Include a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term funding may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash and life insurance policies to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own funds if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles at the crossing.
Choose a healthcare representative by setting up a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts will take into account your health wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the authority of the person to make your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are not able to do so on your own.

Disasters and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, and the number of victims was expected to increase.
At the interrupted communications connections, the rescuers from the Dongal Regent were unable to obtain any information from the area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake in Palu.
Some key data on Palu and Dongali in Slovenia:
Palu is the capital of Central Slovenia, the province that lies at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulavezi and is expected to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
It reached the province extending over 300 km (180 km) of the coast on the north-west of the island of Sulavezi.
Regents, the administrative unit under the province, had 299,000 inhabitants in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Slovenia are fisheries and farming, in particular in the central region of Dongal.
In the province there is also an important activity of mining nickel, which most of the time takes place in Morovlia, on the opposite side of Sulawesia.
After reporting to the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disaster Relief over the past 100 years, Pala and Dongal have been repeatedly affected by tsunamis.
In 1938, the tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongal.
In 1996 he also injured the tsunamis in northern Dongallo and caused the death of nine people.
Indonesia is sitting on an active Pacific fire meal, so the earthquakes are regularly occurring here.
In recent years some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been the following:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that affected 14 countries and caused the deaths of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian assessment, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The type of strong earthquakes hit Western Sumatra late March and early April.
More than a hundred people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of 6,8 affected the southern part of Java, the most inhabited Indonesian island, and triggered tsunamis that flooded its southern coast and caused death to almost 700 people.
2009: The magnitude earthquake 7.6 occurred near the town of Padang, the main town of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The magnitude earthquake of 7.5 affected one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered tsunamis of up to 10 metres, which destroyed the ducata village and caused death to about 300 people.
2016: Flooding of the earthquake affected the regent Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, the tsunamis did not start, but the buildings fell and killed more than 100 people.
2018: More earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily held thousands of tourists.
The arrest of Sarah Palin's oldest son for family violence
Track Palina, the oldest son of the former governor and deputy presidential candidate Sarah Palin, were arrested for the charge of the attack.
A 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for the amount of violence in the family, obstructing the application of violence in the family and resisting the arrest, the Alaska State Troopers police agency reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin learned that when she tried to call the police to report a alleged criminal offence, she picked up the phone.
The fuel was attached to the Precassional Institute of Mat-Su and is in custody under an unsecured guarantee of USD 500, the TV network of KTUU reported.
He appeared at the courthouse on Saturday, where he was said to be "unfortunately innocent", when he was asked about the ban, reported the network.
The fuel was charged with three Class A violations, which means that they could close it up to one year and punish it with a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B infringement punishing him with one day in prison and depth in the amount of USD 2000.
The fire of the crime is not charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with violence in the family, interference in the application of violence in the family and possession of weapons in an alcoholized state in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin criticised the veteran groups when violent behaviour of her son linked to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning to military service in Iraq.
Cunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
Magnitude 7,5 earthquake triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks are broken down, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred only in central Slovenia, which lies north-west of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing a moment of shock.
When the tsunami hit the coast, more than a hundred people were held at the festival in Pala on the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely demand a death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York require a death penalty for Saifull Saip, a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died. It is a rare sentence that has not been committed for federal crimes in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was intended to use a rented truck to launch a road attack along the West Side motorway in Lower Manhattan when he drove several pedestrians and riders in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov 's intention' killed eight victims and ' purposely' caused serious bodily harm, is included in the notification of the death penalty claim lodged in the South of New York.
According to the court document, there may be a reason for the death penalty of any of the charges.
Several weeks after the attack, the Great Federal Court of Saip informed the defendant in 22 points, which included eight charges for murder in aid of rape used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as a charge for violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "significant planning and seizure", and the prosecutors who described Saip's way as "student, cruel and sophisticated".
“Sayfully Habibulaevic Saipov has caused damage, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Clevesa, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Draka, Ariela Erlija, Hernana Ferruchija, Hernana Diego Mendoze and Alejandro Damian Pagnuccoa,” is written in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court of the South District pronounced the last death sentence ten years ago.
The Khalid Barnes accused of murdering two drug providers, and finally, in September 2009, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The death penalty was last pronounced in 1953 in New York City by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who killed him because of the invasion of the Soviet Union between the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg died at the electric table on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any regret in the days and months following the attack, as indicated in the court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators he felt good about what he had done.
After the indictment, he told Saip's authorities that he was inspired by the video ISIS he saw on the phone to carry out the attack.
The police also said that they had requested an ISIS signal release in their hospital room.
With regard to 22 points of the indictment, he said he was innocent.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal public defenders, said they were "evidently disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand a death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt in return for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the suffering in relation to these events,” Patton said.
Saip's defense team has before asked the prosecutors not to require a death penalty.
NIGELA FARAGEEA, a Turkish Member, should be responsible for the Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today during a protest at the Torici conference that he would "mobilize the human army".
The former leader of Ukipa said that politicians must "feel the heat" of the Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's own MPs proposed to be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said on a trip to Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "now be outside" if it were Mr Farage's secretary for the break.
However, the challenge faced by Mayeva in coordinating its deep-separated species has also been highlighted by the thorists, who have turned down the brakes, who have joined a separate protest against the brakes in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain his plan in a typhoon between the attacks of the defenders of the brakes, the opponents of the brakes and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayeva in Brussels try to reach an agreement despite opposition and force Euroskopstics and Laborists to choose between his package and "caosome".
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave (Department means departure) in Solihul that "he wants to get rid of Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as a negotiator and assign him the responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he were in charge, he would be out there by now,” he said.
This member from Wellingborough added, "I'm going to take a break, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
He described his opposition to the EU as saying: "We have not fought in world wars to be servants now.
In our own country, we want to adopt our own laws."
Mr. Bone rejected the proposal that the public opinion since the 2016 vote changed: "The idea that the British have changed and want to stay in the EU is completely unrealistic."
At the meeting, also, was the Turkish Brixist Andrea Jenkyns, who told the reporters: “I simply say: ‘Ministry President, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, but it is also unpopular with our customers and our activists who are active on the streets and even lead us to election.
Please leave Chequers and start listening.’
In a message to Mr Mayeve, she added: "Premiers keep their service when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said at the meeting that the policy should be given "a sense of warmth" if they intend to issue a decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
“Now it is a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
"They're trying to release the brake, and today we're gathered to tell them, 'We're not going to let you do this.'
In the message, the enthusiastic crowd added: "I want you to give our political class, which is on the edge of the Brexit issue, to feel the heat."
"We are mobilizing the human army of this country, which has given us the victory at the break, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the hostages walked through Birmingham, where they had a double meeting in the city center.
After the group was set up this weekend, an activist pistachios with the flags of the Torians against the brakes.
Lord Adonis's Labourist tribe laughed at the conservatives because of security problems when using the client's application after opening the conference.
“These are people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for the border without stops, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is nothing like a good brexit," he added.
Warren's possible pursuit of the President's position will "be thoroughly studied"
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says that "cooperation in the presidential contest will be studied in detail" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a meeting with citizens in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will act against Republican Geoff Diehl in November 2016, who was the vice-president of Trump's election campaign in Massachusetts.
It is at the centre of speculation in order to be able to deal with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of 'town hall' since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was going to negotiate for the president's seat.
Warren's reply is that it's time for "a woman in Washington to repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top."
Arrest after the death of LSU Sims in shooting
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that she had arrested a suspect on Friday to shoot a basketball player LSU Wayda Sims.
The police station in Baton Rougu reported a 20-year-old Simpson arrest at the 11 a.m. press conference.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help in identifying a person on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near the campus of the South University.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot in his head and therefore finally died,” the police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media, reported the 247sports network.
Wade was involved in protecting a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to questioning that he was at the end of the incident, that he had a gun, and that he shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a charge and taken to police station East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season with 10 starters, on average with 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps to the game.
Russia's great prize: Lewis Hamilton approached the world champion's title, and the team ordered him to leave Sebastian Vettlu.
On Saturday it became at the time when Valteri Bolts qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it is clear that "the Mercedes team will have a strong influence on the race".
Bottas had a good start on the fence and almost left Hamilton on the dry side when he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettla to attack his teammate.
Vettel took the first to the box and let Hamilton ride on the rope of traffic, which should be decisive.
Mercedes took him to the box later and left him behind for Vettl, but Hamilton noticed after some driving actions that the Ferrari's inapplicability leaves the inside of the side open and the risk that two moves to defend in the third corner will be left behind.
Max Verstappen started with the last type of network and was at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday in the seventh place.
Then it's most of the game of vehicles without a change of noise, as he was going to perform a quick finish, speed up the Kimija Raikkonen and occupy the fourth place.
He finally took the box in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could not increase speed, so the fourth place was occupied by Raikkonen.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri's been a fantastic vehicle all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he let me out.
The team has really done an extraordinary job to reach the first and second places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body speaker.
President Donald Trump smiled at the meeting on Saturday because of her insistence that she did not disclose Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which was the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugha's charge of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly touch Ford's testimony before the Senate's commission of inquiry, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad, corrupt and false".
“The only beautiful thing that can happen that happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are wicked, corrupt and false,” he said.
"When you look at the revelations and the revelations, people say, 'No, I didn't do it'."
I didn't do that."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you find out?
Remember her answer... you revealed the document – "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Okay, hold on a second.
We found him... no, we didn't," he added about the senator's impression.
Ford's letter with details about the charges against Kavanaugh was sent in July and the media was disclosed early in September – but Feinstein's denied that it came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s complaint, I didn’t disclose her letter,” The Hill Feinstein’s officer told the Commission.
"She asked me for trust, and I kept her as confidential as she asked."
Her denial apparently did not correspond to the president who said at a meeting on Saturday night: “I tell you, it was a really bad body speaker.
It may not be, but it was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
In defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of improper sexual conduct, the president suggested that the democracy of the charges be abused for its own purposes.
“They are determined to regain their power with all possible means.
You have seen evil, anger, they don't care who they're affected and who they have to drive to fight for power and control,' the president should say after the media site's report.
Elitna disease: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer killed two goals for the Greats against Dundee.
Dundee Stars has been redeemed for a fifth loss in the elite league against Belfast Giants with a win at a Saturday match in Dundee at 5:3.
Giants soon told about two goals at Patrick Dwyer's and Francis Beauvilleer's hits.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were the same for the home side, and then Dwyer regained the advantage of Giants.
Francois Bouchard was equal to Dundee before the two goals of Lundvald Nielsen provided them with a victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elith League for Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee at 2:1 on Friday night.
This was the fourth season meeting between the teams, during which the Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwyer reached his first goal in the game in four minutes at 3:35 with Kendall McFaull's assistant, Beauvilleer, who won four minutes later, and gave David Rutherford.
In an intense opening at 13:10, Sullivan again told the game home side, and Matt Marquardt gave Cownia the equation at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of the management of the Giants on vacation when at the end of the first third he scored his second goal of the evening.
The home side was gathered again, and Bouchard had the remnant rewarded with a violent crowd at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran unitedly helped Nielsen to take advantage of Dundee at the end of the second third and to take care of the fifth goal of his team of half a third and to take care of the fifth goal of his team.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play the next game on Friday home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller, with his death, allowed more than a hundred people on the plane to escape the earthquake
The air traffic controllers in Indonesia celebrate as heroes, after sacrificing his life so that a plane with more than a hundred people could fly safely.
In the Friday earthquake on the island of Sulavezi, followed by the tsunami, more than 800 people died, and many were missing.
The area continues to be under stress by powerful underscoring suns, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Paul.
Although the employees fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung did not leave his workplace in a heavily grumbled control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Pala.
He remained in it so that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the flight path, could safely fly.
Then he jumped out of the control tower because he thought he was up.
He died in the hospital later.
The representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the decision might have saved more than a hundred lives, reported the Australian media house ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter to take him to a larger hospital in another town from Balikpapan in Kalimantan.
I'm sorry we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Pala.
“Our heart is in the market when we hear it,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could reach more than a thousand, as the accident relief agency in the country has said that access to towns in Dongal, Sigia and Boston is limited.
“The number of the dead should be increased, as many bodies were under the ruins, but many could not be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the agency.
Pala, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, the waves, up to six meters high, have disappeared.
Military and commercial aircraft are providing assistance and assistance.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the rescue vehicle brings the body.
It lacks clean water.
The minimum markets are exhausted everywhere.’
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross hits to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy that can become much worse."
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palo and told the National Army: "All of you please work night and day to fulfill all the tasks associated with evacuation.
Are you ready?" After reporting CNN.
In the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by a earthquake in Lomboka, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says that one man misses one man after a plane crash.
The airline, which operated a flight headed by the Pacific Laguna in Micronesia, now says that they miss one person after first communicating that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini announced on Saturday afternoon that a missing male passenger.
The airline was told to cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and investigators when searching for the missing person.
A call for more information about a passenger, such as his age or nationality, did not immediately respond.
Local ships helped to rescue other passengers and crew, after the plane was working at the water when it tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials said they took seven people to the hospital.
At the airport, it was said that there were eight passengers who were all in stable condition at the hospital on Saturday.
The cause of shock and precise sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane had landed in the lagoon just before the road.
Some of the witnesses said the plane was wrong.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was down very low.
“That’s extremely good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other passengers were able to pass through the stream of running water to the powerful exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the stewardess panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that it was also the help of sailors who had repaired the request in the vicinity. They helped to solve the stormy boat that people were taking to the ground before the plane sank to about 30 metres (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the Air Safety Network show that in the last two decades of air accidents in Papua New Guinea, 111 people died, but this was the first accident that happened to Air Niugini.
The analyst set the time at night when the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution presented its evidence on Saturday in a retrial to a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The US Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone records to determine the movement of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he received location information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night before her death, which contradicts his previous claims, reported Officer The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers when he said he was with a friend Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford talked on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said he was "laughing because he was [my] truck in Nashville."
The second inconsistency was that Tellis said that he knew about two weeks after Chambers died.
The cell phone records show that they only met for one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis had deleted Chambers' texts, calls, and contact information after Chambers died on his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defence should present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that the jury should judge the trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hippop?
Hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hippop has distanced from the original political and social engagement.
They want to go back to his roots and re-make a conscious hipope popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently experienced a new rise with artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the United Kingdom.
Another black?
The New York Guard sues a couple because they fired her because of the "racist" message
The New York Guard sues a couple for discriminatingly dismissing her after receiving the wrong sent message of a mother who complained that "there is one black."
Couples deny racist behaviour and the complaint is compared to "exulsion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment in 2016 when a new guard, Giselle Maurice, found that it was black when she arrived.
“NOEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE SEN A ČNKA,” wrote Plasco-Flaxman in his message to her husband.
But instead of sending him to his husband, she sent him to Mr. Maurice twice.
After finding out that she was looking at Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “unappreciative”, Mrs. Maurice’s forgiveness, saying that her outgoing security guard, who was an African American, was doing a bad job, wanted to hire Filipino, reported Officer New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a payment for one day's work, and then she and Uber were sent home.
Maurice's spouse now claims compensation of USD 350 per day for a period of six months for work for which he was first hired, even without contract.
“I want to show them, you know, such things don’t start,” she told Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the charges of racism, claiming that Maurice's forgiveness was reasonable, for they feared that they would no longer be able to trust her.
"The wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband for Post.
"Would you be willing to trust your children, to whom you were disobedient, even if it happened because of reason?
Your newborn?
Come on.’
When comparing the complaint with ‘immigration’, Plasco said that his wife was born only two months ago and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
"Are you going to get over someone like that?
This is not nice," the investment bank added.
Although the procedure before the Court is still under way, the Court of Justice is a couple on social networks because of its conduct and the way in which it thinks quickly.
The publishers of the story of the bear Paddington were afraid that readers would not associate with the speaker bear, has revealed a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It was hard to put in the skin of someone who had read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to find out now that Paddington has become an exceptional success."
She said that her father, who first worked as a cameraman for BBC, before getting inspiration to write a child's book on a small bear toy, was bitter when he refused his work, added that after his death last year she was the 60th anniversary of the book "Green Sweet".
Regarding a bear named Paddington, who described him as “a very important member of our family”, she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was those people who didn’t like to praise,” she said.
“But because the bear Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if something had reached your child: You are proud of her, even though you are not really doing it on your own.
I think that in the success of a bear, Paddington looked in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed success to a bear named Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
At the time, her daughters were taken to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors of time tried to preserve her life.
“Now she regularly called to say that she really felt bad that she didn’t expect it to happen,” said Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I got Nad's call. He told me that she would die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given to her by the doctors to continue to pump her heart slowly and leave her system.
She's been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a position when my family and people surrounded me.
I really had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperous, who was already complaining about the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, unaware of the trials she was experiencing.
“No one knew,” she said.
"I had my head removed, and all the time there were tears in my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this strong feeling of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her."
Grieving female sticky posters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one because of suicide try to turn others away from taking life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Valežan bridge are sticking posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mr. Tyler's son was 13 when he fell into depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want you to feel like I do every day for any parent,” she said.
Ms. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with a smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up every room."
But before he died, he stopped working because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found a fellow man when he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm worried that the domino effect will occur."
Ms. Davis made a poster "to let other people know that people you can turn to and talk to are available, even if they are friends.
Do not sit quietly – you need to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who was Davies' friend for several years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He did not say that he felt depressed, depressed, or otherwise,” she said.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, he was completely on the ground. When the children opened the presents, he did not have an eye contact with them or something like that.”
She said that her death was a severe trauma, but they had to be processed: “She cut the hole into the entire family.
She broke us up.
But we must continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh all at the start of the FBI air investigation
“I thought that if we could actually do what he asked for – after the duration and extent of a limited investigation, this might be a point,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world would fall apart because of a tight customer stop.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their resistance is a consequence of the time in which the investigation would take place.
Until the interim elections, which will take place on 6 November, there are only five weeks left — if the Republicans, as expected, are cut off badly, this will weaken them very much when they try to elect the desired person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the senator several times to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, who presented him to his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI is preparing a report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh in the Senate can collect at least 50 votes, which would have led to the collapse of Mike Pence, Vice-President, from the very position and election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has decreased under Kimo
The number of refugees from North Korea in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un, a South Korean envoy, arrived seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to the data of the South Korean Merger Ministry, said last year 1127 people escaped, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were more stringent border control between North Korea and China and an increase in the price required by the people.
Pjongang has not yet commented publicly.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border.
Most of them escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a highly secure demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China counts refugees for illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relationship between the North and the South, which are technically still in the war, has improved significantly in recent months.
In the early part of this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang in talks focused on the end of the negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kimo Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on efforts for a Korean nuclear-weapon-free zone.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho has granted US sanctions a stop since then.
“Without trust from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be disillusioned unilaterally,” said Mr. Ri, in a statement by the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi named Bretta Kavanaugha as "historic" and said that it was not appropriate for the work at the Supreme Court
The minority head of the representative's house Nancy Pelosi appointed the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugha as "histories" and said that he was significantly inadequate for work at the Supreme Court.
Pelosijeva did so in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anything other than that a woman would, if she knew so, be marked “histories”, Kavanaugh’s fourth testimony to the Senate investigation commission commented on Pelosiev.
Kavanaugh refused the allegations that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford had been sexually assaulted while they were still a teenager.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, at times almost inflamed and discussed his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the democracies in the Commission and pointed out the charges against himself for "grossy and coordinated slander", which was organised by the liberals, because Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 at the presidential elections.
Pelosiev said that he felt that Kavanaugh's testimony had proved that he should not be appointed a Supreme Judge, since he had shown that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I believe that he has discredited himself with such statements and the way he has fled Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosíva is on the question of whether she will try to put a constitutional charge on Kavanauga if it is confirmed and democracy will become the majority in the House for the moment.
“I will say so – if Congress or the FBI does not speak the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court but also for the court at which it is now,” Pelosiev said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosiev said that, as a democratic, Kavanaugh's decision against the Act on Access to Health Care or Roe's case against Wad is considered a conservative judge.
In its confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether to annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, prosthetic person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Is that not wonderful?'," said Pelosiev.
And a woman has to be shot.
It's a fair outcome, after months and years of anger, and it can't express it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” she told me 45 years later. Steinem.
"It doesn't seem very rare to me, what do you think?"
She continued: “She was very helpful to me, a woman who was a director who was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique, which was when she got angry and started to cry, the person she was talking to said, ‘I may feel sad to you because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was great."
The suns are partly allowed as an exit for anger because people misunderstand them.
One of my most powerful memories of my early career, when I was still working in a office where men were ruled, where I once found myself crying in unresolved anger, was an event when an elderly woman, the cold leader, grabbed me at the door, was always a bit scared and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They won't understand that you're angry.
They will think you're sad, and they'll be happy to have reached you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Harta was caught up in a boat on board called Monkey Business and had to leave the game, Mrs. Schroeder found that there was no reason why she could not run for the president alone.
“It was not a well thought-out decision,” she said 30 years later in a laugh.
"There were already seven other candidates in the competition and one more thing was needed at the time.
Someone then called the game “Sneguljčica and seven sticks”.’
Since the campaign was last joined, she remained behind in collecting funds, so she decided not to join the competition unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave the man $1,000, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm going to get a discount?" she asked.
When she announced that she would not start an official campaign, her feelings — gratitude to the people who supported her, discontent with the system, which made it so difficult to collect money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism — prevailed so that she began to breathe.
“They would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Mr. Schroeder said.
"They'd think my official sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my graveyard.
“But she was crying?”
How the US-China War Can Use Beijing
The initial trade wars between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle is not yet over, experts say that the gap between the countries could benefit Beijing for a long time.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, launched the first warning in the beginning of the year by taxation of key Chinese export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new rates for goods worth USD 200 billion (GBP 150 billion), which effectively represents the taxation of half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has always been guilty of equivalent repayment measures, at the latest with rates of between 5 and 10 percent on American goods worth USD 60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed itself to shifting its eye from the United States to the eye, and it is likely not to interfere soon.
In order for Washington to give up, China would have to comply with its demands, but the public elimination of the United States would be too embarrassing for China's President Si Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing knows how to pull the right move, US pressure in the trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China in order to reduce the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger economic turmoil in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have thought so far," said Abigail Grace, an expert collaborator focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security in the Brain Trust.
Syria is “prepared” for the return of refugees, Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return of refugees, and asks for assistance in the reconstruction of a country that has been abandoned in more than seven years of war.
In a statement by the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moual said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to heal areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
All the conditions are now fulfilled for refugees to be voluntarily returned to the country because of terrorism and foreign economic measures aimed at their daily lives and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Serbs have escaped from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries sponsoring the rebels.
Europe has won a victory in Ryder's fall in Paris
The European team won Ryder's Cup in 2018 with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National in Paris in France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soils and Ryder's cup has not been won since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorna's team reached 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had a problem with most of the championships, played a ball in the first couple of 3 games in the 16th hole, and had to hand the game to Francesc Molinaria.
Italian golfer Molinari shined through all circles and became one of the four players who have reached the 5-0-0 score ever since the start of the championship in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth won the lowest ranking European team player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark with 5 and 4.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have played in Ryder's fall the last time.
The veteran of the eight Ryder kisses, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most powerful European player at the top of all time.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help today.
It was hard this year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for raising me and believing me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy that we won the ball again.
It's a team and I'm really glad to be able to help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The staff handed over to John Rama, who won the American golf course of Tiger Woods on Sundays 2 and 1 in individual games.
“I feel incredibly proud that I managed to beat Tiger Woods. When I grew up, I watched his games,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games he played in France, and now has a career record in Ryder's 13-21-3.
This is unusual statistics for one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 big titles right after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team tried hard every week to find the right path, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf at a high level all the time.
The U.S. captain said after a bad performance for his team, "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought."
In the morning, we pressed a few pressure on Europe.
We're down.
The club down before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're going to have to get together again, I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA and our Ryder Committee, and we're going to move on.
I really like these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Get the fuck down.
They beat us."
