PANO Russia will hold a final expert session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO Russia) together with the RAN will hold the third Expert Session “Assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations”.
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, reported in the press release in the "Lenta.Ru".
The third meeting is planning to review the outcome of the expert session for a year and to establish a final list of indicators to assess the performance of scientific organizations.
Individual participants plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of the scientific groups and the criteria for carrying out the evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event on the development of a single approach for all three academics to assess the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
In the past five months, we have done this, and the final version of the regulations is in line.
As a result of the next session, we must complete the process of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the phases and timing of the evaluation," said the head of the expert-analytical management of FANO of Russia, Elena Aksenova.
Representatives of more than one hundred Russian scientific institutions will participate in the event.
As a result, the resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. on 16 September 2014 in Moscow City, Solanka Street, House 14.
Scientists found a way to find a family star
Astrophysics from the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied turbulence and its impact on chemical uniformity in constellations.
It is expected that the opening of the professionals will allow for the search for family members from one cluster.
The results of their studies were published in the journal Nature and can be briefed on the University website.
The result of the same chemical composition of nearby stars is the turbulence in the clouds of gas that preceded the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can be determined by the place of birth and the region of education of the native star.
Scientists had previously doubted that the evolution of the star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from such relatives in the cluster.
The modeling results of astrophysics show that such differences should not occur.
In their research, supercomputers have modeled two streams of interstellar gas that have formed the cloud together.
For a number of millions of years, this object, under its own gravity, has been transformed into a cluster in which protostars are formed.
Scientists added beauty marks to the original gas streams and found that the rapid turbulence in the cloud results in a high degree of chemical uniformity.
According to astrophysics, their research proves that chemical-based stars can be sought, as well as to identify possible regions of education of such objects.
Police arrested the 20-year-old after a high-speed motorcycle pursuit
The motorcycle was confiscated after traveling at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h speed zone and through Bushland to hide from the police in Pilbara.
The transport police patrol in Karrate tried to stop the blue motorcycle this morning, finding its speed reached 125 km/h when he left the service station at Batgate Road.
The police reported that the motorcyclist had not stopped and continued the movement on Bergess Road, and then he turned to Bushland, resulting in the loss of the police.
The motorcycle and the person responsible for the driver's description were noticed near the home of Waltcott Way in Bulgaria.
The police have accused a 20-year-old man of refusing to stop and endanger his leadership.
It must be brought before the World Court of Carrat on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.
Training year in DND to begin not earlier than October
On 1 September, the year of education in the DND will not begin, as only 10 per cent of children in the region will be present.
The Minister of Education and Science of the self-declared Republic of Igor Kostenok reported on this.
According to him, 11 per cent of schoolchildren went to other regions of Ukraine, 20 per cent to Russia.
Schools in the territory controlled by the DND will start no earlier than 1 October.
However, the teacher will go to work on 1 September.
Ended investigation of the TU-204 disaster in Nukovo in 2012
The Russian Investigation Committee completed a criminal investigation into the incident of a TU-204 aircraft crash at the Vnukovo airport in December 2012.
This has been reported today to the RC RF.
“The Moscow Interregional Investigation Office of the Russian Investigation Committee completed a criminal investigation initiated by the accident of the aircraft TU-204 Red Wings at the airport on 29 December 2012, on the basis of the crime provided for in article 263 of the RF/infringement of the safety rules on the movement and operation of air transport caused by the insecurity of two and more persons/”, says the department.
The result of the disaster was a failure to implement standard procedures and an increased landing speed.
George Webster charged with rape in the hotels in Nuremberg and Pitlochri
The man will be brought before the court of charge of rape of women in two rooms.
George Webster, 28 years old, was accused of listening to the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman at the Scotland Hotel in Pitlohri, Pertshir County, on 7 June 2013.
Webster was alleged to have attacked her when she was "without consciousness, asleep and unable to agree."
Webster is also accused of rapeing another woman at the Golf Vow Hotel in Nerne, North Scotland, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Ray appointed a hearing in the High Court in Edinburgh on 17 November.
Lavrov: Russia will not be "locking the door" because of new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not be "locking the door" for new sanctions.
This is what Mid-MID Head Sergei Lavrov said today, speaking to students and teachers of IGMO.
In view of our response to the new wave of anti-Semitic sanctions, I will not even debate, fantasize, because everything has to be calculated specifically, he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will like this time, then we will decide on how to respond.
This will not be linked to a knock on the door, some attempts, falsely understood, - the Minister stressed.
We will, above all, distance ourselves from our interests, protect our economy, the social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the partners' action on their adequacy, treaty capacity and reliability.
Following the steps taken in the field of sanctions, it is very good to judge what partners are seeking, as continued by the head of the IMF.
If the whole voice says that "they will also be ill for us, but we have to go to Russia to punish," that is probably not very appropriate.
With regard to WTO's departure from the RF in response to possible new sanctions, there is no.
On the contrary, we want to strengthen the WTO instrumentaries, including when it comes to trade disputes, said Lavrov.
We have already used this tool to overcome, as we believe, the EU's discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of dumping, and anti-dumping measures are being applied against the RF industry.
"We are ready to implement WTO mechanisms and to resist our position on the inability to apply the third EU energy package retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How is it proper to use cheese in design now?
Questions were answered by Irina Okuneva:
Since the siren loses its main attraction after flowering, it is desirable to use it along with other artists.
She's wonderfully intertwined with many cultures.
Close to the cheese can be and needs to be cooked both plants decorative at other times and colouring at the same time.
Another plus cheese is that it provides a mass of opportunities for creativity.
You can shape its stem tree of different heights, improved with art, a wide-based art and even a garden buns - a tree with a wonderfully faded glass.
Just choose the form that is more consistent with your design now.
In Carlia for the sale of counterfeit money, the resident of Leningrad
As reported in the Republican IMF, the man engaged in his criminal activity in the Oloneck region and in the Segage region.
In addition to Carilia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused had already succeeded in inheriting the Vologad area, where he had been sentenced to two and a half years in prison this spring.
Later, the man was brought before the Dutch District Court.
And to complete the investigation of crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Segeguz.
In the investigation, there was evidence of a number of episodes of counterfeiting in the summer of 2013.
At the end of June of the current year, criminal proceedings were brought before the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the Court decided to replace the four-year term of imprisonment with a general rule of law.
The sentence has not entered into force legally.
Remember, last week, two more counterfeit money merchants were convicted, who were paid for in the Petroszewdska shops.
The citizens of Azerbaijan also arrived in Carlia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is free for five years, the other for four.
Every man has a fine of 500 thousand rubles.
The sentence has not yet entered into force.
In Arkansas, the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first “Dervis” convoy was celebrated.
The meeting, which took place in the district centre, was about the first Arctic convoy.
Dervis provided military assistance from the United States and United Kingdom to the USSR.
In the Arkangel meeting, the memory went into the foundation stone for the future memory of the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the coast of Sedova in Solombal.
The event was attended by representatives of the Veteran organizations of Arkangelska, children of the Cadets class.
For the first time, we gathered twenty-three years ago when a stone was laid.
But also today's event is not a holiday, but a day to remember those who haven't returned to the sea," said the chairman of Boris Karpov's Board of Veterans of the North Sea Passage.
The event was followed by a city spirit orchestra, and the Cadette class students gave the veterans flowers and marched with Russian flags and the name of Victory.
The meeting ended with the coloration of the stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of form bottles, lead, copper and many other inventory and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and weapons were on board, including 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Harrikein miners, in a decommissioned state.
In the meantime, the convoys consisted of 16 WFP ships in Great Britain, two of which were aircraft.
The caravan of ships was not found by the opponent and was well reached at the appointment point - Arkangelska.
Of the 848 vessels involved in vital caravan operations, 126 were killed and about 50 military vessels were killed.

I remember a very American idea that labour rights are human rights.
Congressmen Kit Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill on which trade union organizations are protected as civil law.
"Where trade unions, there and jobs of the middle class," says Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat, who is co-chaired by Congress of the Progressive Group.
That is why I am proud to represent the Act on the empowerment of workers, together with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination in the organization of trade unions, as in other forms of discrimination, which will prevent the forces of trade union opponents.
Amendment of the Labour Relations Act in such a way as to enable workers facing discrimination to participate in trade unions, to seek justice in civil courts, and to receive compensation for damages and fines, a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellis, Lewis and the co-authors of the bill are to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks of trade unions in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country, Americans once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
It was a time that millions of Americans still remember when that country at the same time protected democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas McArthur and his assistants helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military-led autocracy of Hidecka Todzió was replaced by democracy.
While fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of new Japan, they included a text that directly recognized that “the right of workers to organization, to negotiations and to collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that openly stated: “The right to form associations in order to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to undermine this right will not have legal force; measures aimed at these purposes will be considered unlawful.
When the former former Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chaired by the International Commission on Human Rights, which formed the World Declaration on Human Rights, to be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the composers included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and enter into trade unions for the protection of his interests”.
The American generations have taken the basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When the country consulted other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and that the trade union should participate as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions - should be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is indeed wise to return to the American ideal that workers should have the right to organize and to hear their voices in a free and open society.
As the famous Martin Luther King Younger said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that trade union movement has not undermined the strength of the nation, but has increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions have miraculously created a market for industry and have raised the nation as a whole to an indistinguishable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history will remember them.
The story reminds us of what we should do.
The official recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the expansion of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination against trade union organizations - has long been seen.
Kit Ellison and John Lewis are reinvigorating the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, the federal judge temporarily blocked the entry into force of Louisiana's law, which his supporters say will probably cover all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this, which was signed to be carried out by Governor Louisiana Bobbi Giindal in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who are taking abortions would be required to have the authority to accept patients in the hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions at the present time by continuing to seek such powers.
"The claimants will be allowed to work legally while continuing to exercise their powers," wrote Judge John DeGrewells in his decision.
The hearing will be held during the month during which the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
The defenders of the right to abortion were delighted to see this decision, the last time it was decided against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to get hospital powers.
“Today’s decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from a barbarous law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Nortap, president and head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who applied for the suspension of the law by three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately apparent whether a decision was made to doctors from two clinics who had not spoken to the complainants on the matter and had also made a statement of authority.
Louisiana is one of the 11 states that have adopted such laws, and the courts have recently recognized such non-constitutional measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key elements of the Texas law, which would have closed most of the remaining clinics in that state, were blocked by the federal judge on Friday.
The fights for the right to abortion together with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association say that the laws on the powers of adoption impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary in the medical field.
Aboriginal opponents object that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some have also noted their positive effect on the closure of the clinic.
Only one doctor who is taking abortions in Louisiana has a hospital admission authority, the Center for Reproductive Rights reported.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop the procedure, the doctor, fearing their safety, would stop the procedure, the group reported.
In criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish abortion doctors while their statements of authority were awaiting a decision.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of product in the range of trade networks should be Russian production, according to Mr. Oleg Nilov, a member of the House of Justice of the Russian Federation.
The Parliament has prepared a bill to introduce protective measures against domestic producers, writes the "Reports".
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This concerns goods that are not produced in Russia. <...> According to the rest of the product groups produced in Russia, the rider will have to provide at least half of its own family producers," Nil told the publication.
Along with the amendments to the article “On the basis of State regulation of trade in FP”, the bill provides for a change in the Tax Code, which sets the lowest rate of FDN by 10 per cent in the implementation of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50 per cent quota into trading networks is a package of incentives for Russian producers.
A few times more domestic goods will appear on the trailers.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to Nalovic, a member of the independent expert centre, Sergey Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, will be positive and will lead to growth.
In addition, farmers, farmers, small shops will show up.
They'll be able to sell more, which means they'll grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their conditions and prices to the rhythmians, as they will have to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will result in higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenue, create new jobs, some sectors will start to expand, some faster, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will be reduced several times, in fact, not immediately," the expert noted.
In the past, Russian companies were often unable to access local shops because of high competition from foreign analogues.
Now, after the embargo, this nest has been released and can be breathed with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that after all the necessary harmonization and sanitary checks on the Russian market, food from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be supplied.
In other words, there has now been a moment of peace when the previous players have already left, and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, the demand for domestic raw materials could be increased, as well as the price of ready-made products increased," told Aif.ru, the first Vice-President of the Russian General Public Organization, the Russian Financial Directors' Club, Tamara Kasianov.
Similarly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food in each category will enable the local producers to secure the sector.
In such a case, they would compete with each other rather than with goods that were cheap under the subsidies of another State.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will spread among companies working under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasianov notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of their counterparts, not all of them.
And in this situation, trading networks will have to "draw" the proportion of Russian goods up to half the assortment.
In this regard, there is a growing fear that non-quality goods will be brought to the catchments.
It is possible that foreign products with over-the-counter labels will be supplied in Russia," the expert added.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas is felt by large trading networks, especially those that would benefit from cooperation with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will be affected by such a schedule, as demand for their production will be reduced.
Lithuania does not rule out that the quota law on domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The case is that some Russian production products may fall by the quality of imported analogues, while stores may be able to raise prices for second-hand goods.
The idea of replacing economists with importers in the early 2000s was re-declared in February of this year due to the continuing devaluation of rubles.
In the light of the difficult relations with the West, the question of rejection of imported products is now becoming even more relevant.
The Act is designed to oblige the rivets to be treated as domestic producers when making orders to suppliers.
Then we will go much faster and safer on the way to import, and the production planning system for the necessary types of products will be set up in a shorter time," said Commissioner Oleg Nilov.
In particular, the quota mechanism will be effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the milk sector, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to fully cover the arrivals of Russian shops.
In addition, powerful impulses can also produce meat.
As you know, the largest import is kept in cattle, from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
It turns out that 65-70% still belongs to Russian production," Kasianova argues.
The experts believe that the introduction of quotas for domestic products is more import-friendly and may speed up the process.
However, this initiative will not in itself lead to a replacement because it requires a set of measures, as Lithuania is assured.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative may still be imported from the border, which means that full import will not take place, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
In addition, quotas need to be established, domestic production needs to be established in the country to meet these quotas.
The quotas are only once and will provide such guarantees," said the expert.
A recent diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ova cancer in rural areas is killing more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia face a higher risk of death than those living in cities.
Researchers analyzed the maps of more than 1,100 Australian women with an egg cancer diagnosis in 2005, and found that only 35 per cent of them lived five years after their diagnosis.
The leading researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Studies reported that the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than those living in regions and remote areas of the state than those living in urban areas.
NEXT RESEARCH: New medicines can slow the cancer of the ovaries and the cancer of the ovaries
Researchers have followed the medical course of women in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovaries cancer, the existence of current diseases and the socio-economic status also had an impact on the likelihood of survival.
Women of older age and those with cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovaries, Dr. Jordan suggested that the early diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecology, and they are mainly in large cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of outpatient services that would enable professionals to treat women closer to home and support programmes for people undergoing treatment far from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of the geographical situation, the study found that the long life span of women with ovaries was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elisha Nev, said she had an aggressive form of ovaries cancer.
New FAP doors will be opened in September in the Kužener region
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktybelak was started in April of this year and was carried out on a model project.
The cost of work was over 10 million rubles.
According to the management of public communications and information to the Head of Mary El, the project was financed by means of the Republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the prevention facility is nearly 230 square metres.
There will be medical assistance to the inhabitants of eight settlements: the villages of Toktybelak and the villages of Dementjevo, Puncherumal, Tunya, Fomici, Toraybelak, Shinur and Chaškayal.
The new FAP will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources, and its premises do not meet the sanitary and hygiene requirements.
The new institution will be opened soon.
The dead four-month-old son in a state of insurrection will be brought before the court
The resident of Cheyasia will appear on a stone that is responsible for the murder of his own child.
Cheboxar has completed a criminal investigation into the 31-year-old resident of Novocheboxarska indicted for the death of carelessness.
The investigation found that on 26 July this year, the accused, together with the four-month-old son, came to celebrate the birthday of his cousin in Cheboxara.
After a long time, the new boxer decided to stay in the guest room and put the child to sleep.
When the child woke up and cried at night, she put him near her bed to feed her breast, but soon she fell asleep.
During sleep, a woman fell upon her son, resulting in her drowning.
The criminal case, reports the press service of the S.U.S.C.R. on Chad, sent to the court.
Inflation's out of vacation.
Can the Russians feel a sharp rise in prices?
As a result of the cross-border sanctions, RF and West inflation in Russia will be accelerated and will not be involved in the government's forecasts, convinced by the analysis of the "VTB Capital".
According to experts, the delayed effects of the sanctions will lead to inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, RBK Daily writes.
According to the latest forecast, inflation will be 6.5 to 7.5 per cent in 2014 and 6.5 per cent in the following year and less.
However, as reported in the Commission's report, this week the MER should make “small but basic” adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the Authority may lower inflation estimates for 2015, thereby eliminating the expected increase in population income.
The forecast was that food sanctions for the FF are in force year-by-August 2015.
How could such a situation be expected to be such a high inflation?
The current situation is a shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change," Minfina said.
Economists from the HICP do not share the government's financial and economic expectations for inflation and forecast price increases in 2014 at 8 per cent.
The main effect of product bans will be combined with the possible introduction of RF tax (NSP) in 2015, convinced experts.
The inflation peak of 9 per cent will fall on February, after which annual price increases will fall, experts rely on.
In fact, last week, Rosstat had the first inflation results after the FF imposed "accuracy sanctions".
Aif.ru interviewed the experts and identified their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of Analysis Department FK AForex:
The increase in prices is already seen in the main segments of the goods.
More than the time when products were being valued socially significant, the Government had to launch systematic price stability monitoring in order to prevent the risks of unwarranted price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and riders are already reporting on a daily basis before regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when, and why, is initiating price increases.
The main factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the enormous flow of capital, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-guller, internal conversion due to the migration of the population into foreign currency, as well as the embargo on imports of food products from countries that have joined sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressure remained under control, the value of the minimum product set would not increase by 12 per cent by just one quarter.
The ban on the importation of foodstuffs has led to shocks on the internal market and has led to a very logical increase in final value.
Since we are not able to fully launch the import mechanism at the current stage, as well as to improve the availability of the Russian market through domestic production, response sanctions will continue to pose a risk of inflation.
If you add even fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as poor economic growth prospects, inflation may be more than 8 per cent by the end of the year.
Aleksandr Razwaev, Director of the Alpari Analysis Department
In the 1990s inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent a month, and it was also at zero levels above the current level, another case that was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think inflation will be 8-8.5% as a result of the year.
Platon Maguto, Managing the Fund of Maguto
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia as long as it succeeds, but if further pressure is to be added, especially to the financial sector, this may lead to some difficulties and increase inflation expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally reflected in the purchase of cash in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the Government, the CBF and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of hair, both by market methods and by government regulation.
But the price increases are starting traditionally after summer's silence and perhaps this autumn will become more sensitive.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia is 7.5%, most likely due to the fact that the RF still has financial stockpiles.
Gardening centres benefit from a reduction in the number of households
Such a decline, due to the exceptional reduction in the number of households under 35, may lead to the loss of tens of millions of pounds per year by the time young consumers reach the “basic age of planting”, according to the HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, the people who take the rent spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that the owners of their own homes spend on gardening.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in high-urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of the front yards for parking and the reduction of sizes now as other factors that pose a threat to the industry, the annual volume of which is estimated to be £5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of households fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest level of expenditure on household garden products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society reported that renting housing and no space for the moment did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief gardener in RHS, said, "Increasing plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can transport plants with themselves when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden age” of differential trade in vegetable products as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
Bulgaria ' s Ministry of Agriculture has conducted a massive cleanup in the Land Fund
Three of the four heads of the Land Fund were replaced on Friday.
In general, three of the four heads of the Land Fund were replaced on Friday.
The official Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria reported only the removal of the office of Executive Director Atanas Beceva.
His place was Lozana Vasileva.
It has appeared that two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund were replaced on Friday at night.
The released Deputy Executive Director, Tatian Angelov, who had so far been responsible for State aid and SApard's programme, reported BGNES with reference to Trud.
I did not attend the Board of Directors of the Fund, because under law we are not members of the leadership, but I was told later that I was released.
I can't tell you why my release is not reported on the fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I'll know more on Monday," Angelov told me.
Its seat will be Ivanka Baghdadov, who has thus far been the head of Investment Credit in the Central Fund in the Landland in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
To date, he was responsible for direct subsidies for EU-paid fields.
He will be appointed Zivko Zivkov, who was head of the Landland Fund in the city of Veliko-Tirnovo until January 2014.
Only the Deputy Chief of the Atitj Alieva-Veli Fund has retained her position.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey challenges an American diplomat in connection with spying
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey called for the country's highest-ranking American diplomat to explain the report on American and British spying in Turkey.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Budget, reported that the US-owned affairs officer and Turkish officials had discussed the communication on Monday.
The German journal Der Spiegel and The Intercept reported that the documents provided by former analysts of the U.S. National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a priority object of exploration for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has distorted the importance of this message, he said that all leading countries are spying on each other.
The information previously reported that the main intelligence agency of Germany had also made Ankara an object of intelligence has caused a more angry response to the Turkish Government.
The main Chinese companies were united against Alibaba
China's largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giant Tencent Holdings (sites, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (China's largest search engine) are creating a company that will compete in the online trade market with Alibaba.
However, to catch up with the Chinese Internet, which has left even its American opponents - eBay and Amazon.com, it will not be easy.
The Union of the Great
The companies plan to invest in a joint venture of 5 billion yuan ($814 million), 70 per cent of it will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent to each of the online companies, as reported in the Wanda Group.
The company is planning to register in Hong Kong.
The SSP will combine Baidu's search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest merger in China, with around 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to the network of 40 fascene-belts, the Wanda Group manages at least 49 commercial real estate facilities across China and 40 trading centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a cinematography and the theme park in Cindao (a town on the east coast of China).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors per year and bring income at $960 million.
In addition, Wanda has an AMC Entertainment Holdings cinema network, making it the world's largest movie theater operator.
By 2015, Wanda is planning to equip all its shopping centres, hotels and entertainment sites with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the newly created rival Alibaba.
According to Dun Cé, who will lead a new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site should be the largest online-to-offline platform in the world, notes Dun C.
The content of online-to-offline (O2O) is to attract buyers on the Internet so that they can come into ordinary offline stores or buy other traditional services.
The classic example of O2O is the Groupon or Vigoda.ru coupon sales service.
"O2O is the largest "perog" in online commerce," said leader Wanda Van Xianlin (the Bloomberg quote).
"Now the O2O site in China does not exist, and in this situation the chances are almost equal," he said.
China's largest online market in the world, and, according to McKinsey & Co., it will increase more than three times by 2015 than in 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, Bloomberg reports official statistics: more people in any country than India.
And it is estimated that by 2015 this number could grow to 850 million.
The Union of the Richer
Tencent Ma Huaten's head was recently the richest person in China, but according to the Bloomberg millionaires' index, the founder of Alibaba Jack Ma has already seized him for $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's condition is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is attributed to his share in Alibaba.
The leader Baidu Robin Lee is now taking third place among the richest people in China, while Van Xianlin from Wanda is the fourth line of ratings.
"It is very interesting to watch this battle: three of the richest people combine their efforts to meet the challenges even more rich," Bloomberg, director of the Chinese Centre for Electronic Commerce Research at Hanzhou Cao Lay.
But he believes that the new company will hardly be able to compete with Alibaba immediately after the creation of "Rim can't be built in one day".
The fact that Alibaba does not just compete with new companies, but also with the world’s leaders on the Internet, shows a recently published report on the financial indicators of Alibaba for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as an average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company has earned more than its two American competitors together.
The net profit of Alibaba for almost twice exceeds the same sum of competitors - it increased almost three times per year and amounted to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has great potential for money generation, in many ways thanks to its mobile applications," Bloomberg commented, an analyst from Hong Kong's Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba prospectus on the website of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of mobile users of the company's services in July was 188 million, which exceeded substantially the March (163 million).
However, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter have been connected to mobile devices.
Alibaba is to be called the value of its shares in front of the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed in Bloomberg, the company could be estimated at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, the Alibaba debut at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) can take place on 16 September.
The road show, which preceded this event, starts on 3 September.
Alibaba's exit to the IPO is expected to be a record in the history of NYSE and will allow companies to attract about $20 billion.
So far, a record of the amount of funds involved in US stock exchanges has been owned by the Visa payment system, which in 2008 has made a primary investment of $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food in the trade networks must be Russian production, as Members of the House consider it.
They have developed a bill on this subject.
This is the amendment to article 8 of the FP “On the basis of State regulation of trade in FP” and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, of at least 50 per cent of domestic products in stores must be per product type.
However, the paper will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits of winter, so they will be made “distorted” in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amended the RF Tax Code, which sets a 10% reduction rate for all food products originating in Russia, as reported in the Report.
On 27 August, a draft law was introduced in the lower House of Parliament to amend the "Difference Markets" Act, which proposes to re-establish farms in Russia, where small producers will be able to implement their products.
The chief of police, Magalupa, charged with corruption
The complainants provided evidence of the claim by the police and officials of the Municipality of Kalvia at the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The chief of the Calvia Police on the resort island of Malorca was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in a scandalous centre of unsuspecting drinking Magaluffe.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of the allegations of corruption brought against him by several businessmen with Punt Ballen, a street on which most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to a daily publication by Mallorca Diario, the complainants presented evidence of harassment by the police and officials of the Municipality of Kalvia at the Office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca against Corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Guardians of the National Guard of Spain on charges of corruption and will be interrogated by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that poor night club owners said that protectionism by the authorities was serious about their business.
"The word is no longer about making money, it's about to survive," one of the businessmen told the court.
Our sources of existence cannot be threatened.
There's nothing to lose.
Magaluf fell into the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British respirator who took 24 men to the bar at the time of the bar.
The island's authorities have since tried to stop the hooliganism in the state of the Magaluf's breathing, with a minimum number of scandalous bar drinking.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where an incident occurred with the mine, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and Carnage bar organizers were charged together for €55,000 ($73000).
The Magaluf tourist resort, mainly popular among young British vacationers, was also the scene of numerous accidents in the state of alcohol abuse related to foolish entertainment known as "balconing" when people come from one balcony to another or from the balcony to a hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and wind conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise in South Australia, brought rain showers and strong winds that affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city at night at 9:00 p.m., after 6:6 mm, which fell on the night of the resurrection.
The last rain was preceded by a pair of short streams with a broken wind, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 o'clock in the evening and poured almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After wintering the early spring season last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The high-quality conditions are expected to be one of the reasons why Virgin Airlines was delayed from Melbourne in Adelaide.
The plane was to land immediately after 7:30 p.m., but it fell into the zone of the wind shift -- sudden change of speed or wind direction at a short distance -- and it was forced to rise.
Wind currents reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to be lifted at the time of the second landing, and the plane finally landed at 8:40 p.m..
The delay in this journey led to the subsequent delay of several other voyages, including the Emirates from Dubai and the Qantas from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two rivers.
Calculation of construction facilities in the RF will take place again
Price formation, construction management, and networking issues of the Federal Anti-Money Service are subject to special control.
The FAS established an expert council on competition in the field of construction.
At its meeting, the Head of Control, Construction and Natural Resources, FAS Wadim Saloviev, said that “the calculation of construction facilities today is absolutely improbable”.
The normative base makes price formation transparent and can lead to unwarranted cost of construction, considered in FAS.
And they suggest that the value of the construction of housing facilities at the design stage should be determined on the basis of market prices for constructive solutions instead of the estimated standards and unit values for technological operations applied today.
These proposals have been put into the road map and are now under consideration in the disaster.
"The replacement of traditional accounting documentation in the construction of construction components should lead to less corruption in the industry," explained the RGB Wadim Soloviev.
For now, every ball and fork is included in the estimate, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation, unfavourable construction companies can bury the whole tractor.
The FAS has agreed.
"The first conversion work on the value of the building elements is already under way: methods for calculating the cost of constructive solutions are developed, estimates are based on these indicators," said the head of the Department of Construction and Architecture of the Elena Zukova Ministry of Construction.
As a pilot selected road construction area.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
According to the head of the Profi-Invest construction company Anatolio Demyanko, the estimated rules have long been obsolete, but another business mechanism has not yet been proposed.
"As far as the proposed calculations on structural elements are concerned, it is difficult in practice to realize, since different technologies are often used in building buildings," he said.
It's not a secret that the string is developing in a lot of ways thanks to the guest's order.
In the opinion of the president of the NGO ' s "Expert Community of Hosting Professionals" Ekaterina Lesin, the State is today the most affordable contractor.
The Director of Engineering at Rosatoma Vladimir Malachov's capital building industry centre pointed out that the market is now conditionally divided between companies with access to the contract portfolio and companies with monopoly powers that do not allow competitors to do so.
He believed that the creation of a transparent market could only be provided that access to contracts would be guaranteed as much as possible by the manager.
The expert board was requested to form a host order system in such a way that the same executive would not be entitled to receive more than one contract in excess of 1 billion rubles or several contracts in excess of 1 billion rubles.
They believe that this approach should be assessed in terms of the impact on business, as well as the efficiency of building management.
As Elena Zukova explained, it would be necessary to assign the contracting authority to the functions of the contracting authority, which would result in an increase in the number of the contracting authority and budgetary expenditures for its content.
In this respect, the contracting authority should have knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by the working organizations and their safety.
It will often be necessary to identify who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to the flow of highly qualified procurement participants due to the lack of interest in obtaining a public order for incomplete work and a small amount of contract.
The findings of the Aleksandr Eustaschenkov Institute of Procurement are of the opinion that the host procedure has now become a business game to the attention of the contractor.
And he cited this example: "the applicant must indicate "specific indicators" without indicating the words "or equivalent", "to be", "to be", "to", "more", "to be", "to be", "to be", "to be", "to be", "to be", "to be", "to be less", "to be", "to be", "to be", "to be not above", "to be allowed" or "to be "to be" etc.
Thus, contracting parties often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of an application submitted by the relevant organizations.
Another 44-FZ problem, in the opinion of Eustashchenkova, was the need to assess the quality of the application at a further stage through the party ' s " papery " proposal.
When considering the participant's application, it is true that only the contractor's qualifications, but not the quality of the work that has not yet been carried out, can be assessed - the expert believes.
Quality of work can only be assessed upon receipt.
The expert board was also invited to transfer marginal income from the top to the bottom echelon to disappear from intermediate contractors.
The Chairman of the Expert Board, Status Secretary, the Chairman of FAS, Andrei Carikovski, believes that this is not worth doing, since he must be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it's going to be like, in a famous reception of the Arkadia Rainine, Atele: "Is there a claim for the cowards?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after they had spent the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and mines fell on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the territory was restored after the war.
The start of school activities brought joy and excitement to the populations of southern Israel, but the consequences of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the children's staff at Pashash, in which the rocket fell, cleaned the tracks of the walls and children's pride before the students arrived.
"We are a little scared, but we look forward to it," said Ronit Bart, the resident of Kibuza Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to go back to a moderate life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said the second time she started going back to school was a little weird.
"It was a difficult time, and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibut, which is located near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement ended last week, thousands of inhabitants of border settlements, such as Saad, did not go out or leave their homes, moving to safer areas beyond the Gaza Strip in order to escape the missile and minimote fire.
Many of the inhabitants of Nahal Oz, the settlements near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderota, a city on the border with Gaza, which had been very old since the Palestinian fire.
He advised his children to learn and said, "We will do everything we can to provide you with the knowledge and security of your lives."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an endless transition last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to hostilities, but there remained key issues, such as Hamas's requirement to remove the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to put up arms and bring back the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians, including three-quarters of whom were civilians, died, and at least 494 children, as assessed by the Palestinian side and by the UN.
Israel disputes these figures and argues that at least half of those killed were warriors; however, it did not provide substantial evidence to support that claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the war, Hamas and other Gazaese fighters fired 4591 rockets and mines in the Israeli cities, mainly in the southern part of the country.
The Israeli army, at the time, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of the Israeli attacks, thousands of homes were damaged and destroyed in the Gaza Strip, and 250,000 people were estimated to be sheltered in more than 100 schools, which were transformed into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and the fight continued, education officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon be opened so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohamed Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza's schools.
According to the popular criteria, the price for real estate was the highest winter growth in seven years.
The housing price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 per cent in August and reported RP data on Monday.
This increase resulted in a total increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent higher than the two-month increase in August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed by the country.
RP Research Director Data Tim Louless reported that Sydney and Melbourne had a two-level market.
RP Data shows that housing prices in Sydney have increased by 16.1 per cent in the last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The following market power was Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices grew from five to six per cent on average.
At the other end of the scale, there was Canberra, where government expenditures were reduced, with only 1.4 per cent a year.
Mr. Louless said that, as the spring began, there would be an increase in the number of real estate items sold over the next few months, which would be a “current test” for the market.
"In view of the current high level of auction sales, the overall high sales rate and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the value of the housing will grow in the next three months," he said.
How People Live in the Oldest House of Ufu
In the former house of gold industrymen and miners Eudokima and his son Ivan Demidova on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (formerly Big Kazanski) 18 apartments.
The 18th - century house has not changed from time to time unless it is viewed as a virtue.
Foreigners walk here like on a trip, and the tenants suffer more than they do from their privilege - the right to live in an old ufim house, whose walls are remembered by Colonel Alexander Suvorov.
The date of the construction of the house is incorrect, historians point to two dates: 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, you get that building without a little 300 years.
Old yard, always open door, screwing ladder.
The doors in the apartment are located close to each other, the walls are shaking, and the streets are visible in the light of the sloppy piece of land.
Looks like everything's on an honest note.
And the people of the city say, "You don't think so."
Living in a wooden house of the 18th century is very difficult, says Tatian Lukayanov, apartment residence No. 3.
The object is on the hospice, but the money is not spent for decades, and we feel like the museum exhibits that the authorities have just forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still god-bad, but the foundation is gone.
Many residents still go to the bathroom on the street, and they are in public baths once a week.
How can you be content in such a situation?
The road goes straight under the windows, not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatyana's giving up the party.
Now it's obvious what's been heard before: there's a flow of cars under the windows.
You see, the windows are dwindling all the time, the windows can't open, but they're used to the noise.
But man is accustomed to all things, both good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to the husband, his hands are gold.
Besides, we have two rooms, we live with three sons.
And other families have a much worse condition, and on the second floor, they can hear more than 50 feet [30 m] of height.
For the contrast, Tatyana offers to visit the neighborhood of Apartment No. 6 of the Old Town.
A pleasant host woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a loud smile tells:
We have a single room, 14.5 m2 per four people, and we live with a husband and a daughter with a granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been a second place in the living room, and I've been surrounded by the eyes of a room: antresols, two sofas with a letter "g"; one of them had a grandson with a notebook.
Very close and little is different from the usual domestic interior: only so many beautiful, "historical".
But there is a regular flow of water: there is no need for a water system.
People are talking about their apartment in an orderly and amazing manner, as is the Italian home in the Roman ruins.
So it's a very old one and a very recent one, a daily one, and a legendary one.
The water supply was completed about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in the corner and a toilet from the former hearth.
We live only once in the neighborhood of Demidov and his family, on the second floor of the house.
Our apartment is not privatized, yes and why?
Ufu's real estate center says privatization doesn't matter.
Even if we only get a one-room apartment, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, we were promised to move out, but the promise did not go on.
I'm not used to complaining, and I won't.
In this apartment (room!) lived the whole dynasty: my grandmother and grandfather, my mom and dad, my husband and my daughter and granddaughter.
It's been a while.
For example, healthy rats ran into the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the flag, they're meters thick!
They say that the solution was involved in the eggs, so it's been held for so long.
The house is built on the ground floor. Thank you, Demidov.
It's probably just that's why no one's been killed by a storm or his own.
The construction is still slow to death in our eyes: the boards and bridges of the house are broken down, the fields are repeatedly broken down, we pour cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They're saying, that's what we're talking about, under our secret lasa room, and going to the White River, which has been specially made by some old-fashioned old-fashioned people here, so that you can hide yourself from the danger if you do.
They were chased.
The old man tells us how some historian came to him, asked him to let him start the digging room.
And then he convinced them to give them a ride in exchange for his one - way trip to the island of Octabra.
The story says:
Where are we four in one?
And here, there's a little hope that they're going to give you a more spacious apartment.
If we agreed to trade, we wouldn't win anything.
However, the Old Ages have not won anything.
The biggest dream of Lukmila is to disembark them, and the girls with 16-year-old granddaughter give them a separate room.
That is, two families have rented a two-room apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations now live.
A sympathetic, miniature girl, Olesa Karsakow, from apartment Nos. 11 and 12, shows the second floor of the house.
There are two close rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, and a large family lives there.
Seven of us, two of us.
See for yourself what the conditions are.
The skuttur is washed with pieces, as well as windows, in the walls of the kitchen and in the rooms of the doorway.
The water in the tap is cold for a year.
If you go to Ufu's oldest apartment, you can be sure that most of the women were happy with Laurentiev's wife in apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, places a lot!
The 75 square room is equipped with three persons.
We live only once in the rooms where Suvorov remained on legend during his stay in Ufe, says the head of the Aleksandr Dmitrievic Lavrentiev family.
So high, spacious.
One bad thing is, it's all rubbing around, falling apart, moving around.
The neighbors must have told us!
Most of the tortures we had with the fields: the wooden boards were crushed, the earth was literally out of the foot.
I put the supports, the clinic; there's nothing else in the room, and in the other room we're walking, like we're climbing on the stairs, so much trouble.
About the house of the buyer Eudokima Demidova Alexander Dmitrievic can tell you better any tour guide.
The gold industry refers to him as a relative, speaking of him with admiration.
In fact, the personality was inconvenient: the owner of Kagin and Uzan factory built a house, poured out guns and cocoons, held ural mines.
The heirs of the Tower property are proud of the former, but they no longer want to live under one roof with history.
I moved here as a child, in the '40s, says Alexander Dmitrievic.
Then there were wooden rooms for carats, horseshoes, and caravans, which were then taken away.
In 1968 they wanted to clean up our house, but something was wrong...
The story was repeated in 2014: new housing was again lost.
We, as a team, have collected all the documents, banned the necessary instances, and soon learned that the move to the apartment will take place for 2015 or 2016.
Something we don't believe in anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bascortostan to learn about the fate of the home.
The housekeepers did not accept.
They sent from one table to the other, and then, like a smile, they issued a paper without signature and press: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to housing".
I even felt that our home was not in the city for a long time, because first it was under number 57, then it became 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like he was taken away in the '70s.
The Russian Planet has called on the leading sector to provide information-analytical management of the land resources of Ufi Vladimir Barabash.
The House on the Street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the housing program.
I cannot be responsible for the actions of the officials of the 1970s, only I know that there was a plan for all the old houses at the time, despite historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of modern authorities to restore all old houses on the streets of the October Revolution, which represent architectural value, has been successful.
The pets are soon planned to move to new apartments.
According to Barabbas, the Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of the buildings in Venice will restore the Dom Demidova.
There is now an architectural pool in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 all the former Old Kazan Street will be restored, says the official.
The house will have a suitable kind, corresponding to what was before, three centuries ago.
The home of Demidov is likely to be a museum open to all who want it.
In addition, a decision was made at the Government level to make the street a pedestrian day.
Unfortunately, there will not be too much road congestion in the city.
Moving people from the future Vladimir Barabash Museum is promising in 2015.
However, they will not be satisfied; their new apartments will be the same place as they are now.
Only from the second time.
Forest fires started in Primoria due to the threat
The drought has caused forest fires in the territory of Ochotnichia area in the Firer Region of the Baltic Sea.
At the site of the fire, there is an increase in the pooling of forces and funds.
According to the CGSC’s Primoral Aviation Manual, the conditions set out in the fire site require that the air force be attracted.
Vasili Medvedev, Deputy Air Force Commander:
The fire that occurred in a difficult location has been detected by an observer on board an An-2 patrol aircraft in 3 hectares.
They're burning wooden remains on the old burner.
The intense paralysis of the territory and the steep slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable for the removal of fire-fighting sites, create significant difficulties in the sewer.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of air force at Mi-2 and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was found at the site of the fire, four fire-fighting parachutes were quickly fired.
The main task of professionals is to extinguish the fire and to prepare a space for the delivery of additional fire forces and means.
In the area of lunch in the area of the village of Ohotniki, the helicopter also delivered 3 fire-fighting tanks.
As soon as the helicopter is ready to land in the area of fire, the experts will be transferred to the site of the shower, the Primordial Administration will be reported.
Lenny Henry: My father never fooled me.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to immigrants from Jamaica to Dadley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry repeats the comedy, "Railed Rudy" which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from a series of radio 4 transmissions.
Soundtrack is a mixture of tails and tails, and melodies are life-suffering.
However, Henry had to go through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother died, there was a lot of treatment, besides, Henry is often thinking about his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice, "Stop the noise.
Stay away from your sister.
Move!
I want to look at the cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an insatiable guy in the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Henry had recently opened a Lithuanian masterpiece in Doodle and, although conditions had become better than his father’s day, he was able to look at what his life must have been like.
Now there's a little bit better, but it's dark, smokeless, deep labyrinths beneath with flames of fire and smoke and a dog's burning.
My father went into the bathroom and was just lying there, and you heard him start singing about himself slowly because he wanted to get rid of the Lithuanian master.
When I got there, I realized that he had done this for years and years to earn us a fortune, and I came to appreciate him more.
However, Henry left his childhood of uncaring parental love.
My father never did, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got bad at the end of her life did we start to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frank, allowed him to share the love he had not had in his childhood.
Can you stop that "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Don French.
Why don't you keep me company with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with France, where he was married for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't you take me with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of those who killed her.
So, when I'm very, very, very well, and I've had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
Then I started serious exercise with fitness, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one's eating carrots.
The shift in Henry's career trajectory may be reflected in his noble, short-circuited beard.
From the time he received the acknowledgement of critics for his Hotel, he was fully loaded into the theater.
She followed the "Comedy Error" and then the "Labors" of August Wilson.
This work differs from the nets and comets that were an integral attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
Didjay noticed how he was born on stage, and wrote about him in the New Faces.
His career on television began in the middle of the seventies: "For quite a long time I was the only black paramedic/comic on television."
He learned to work.
Not only did I have to grow up in the audience, I had to learn to be an effective machine for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on television, and that was very difficult.
Lenny in "New Persons" in 1975
Since his manager had the right to "Black and White Men's Show", an easy entertainment program in which people "blacked their face", Henry found out what was in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I don't want this to ever happen to me, but I don't regret what I did.
Although it was a strange, dignified position, I worked in large areas and learned to work with a crowd.
But what was "the award of an easy-to-use class on British television years and years" was also "gross parade on black people".
By representing the characters who were also on the black culture in Britain and who were successful, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of the show Lenny Henry was broadcast in 1984, and in his nineties he was known as, among other things, Chief of the Garrett Blackock comedy series "Chef!".
The commercial roles, documentary films, televisions, and movies took the next ten years of his life, but after his show on the BBC in 2008, "Lenny Henry.tv," he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it doesn't seem like you're wasting your time or your comfort on the side."
There was also a series of documentary transmissions on Radio 4 called "What's Good at...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I've had the present allergy of Shakespeare.
I can't tell you how much I've been taught at school, and I thought it was, in many ways, a high-class white man with a cologne and a hat down front.
So I was very afraid of him.
All we did was take an interview with Peter Holll, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, and say, "You have to try.
Don't worry about it until you know what you're talking about.
Make a few of those words, and you'll understand why we still love Shakespeare.
Henry read 20 pieces from the last monologue, Otello, for documentary transmission, and he got stuck.
I felt like I could do it.
Somehow my head was fixed.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, it's a serious matter, it's a serious study, it's a little study.
So, the repetition process was tough, and I read it for months and months before we put it on.
And she was successful.
They said they were waiting for disasters, and it didn't happen.
We're about to start the "False Comedy."
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical failure, and Henry instinctively felt that his case was to distract the audience.
"Your voice inside me said, "You'll have to work 10 minutes while they're running a computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else figure it out.
"You play the game, stay in the role."
Henry at the "Zaborah" theater in Dachess
It was difficult to study the text for the "Schools".
Panic is useful enough, it strengthens muscle.
They took it well, too, so it was like a sign that says, "Here's what you need to do."
He said that, of course, with a loud voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the dining room.
So Henry's still thinking of comics is that the whole way of our conversation is going through the flames of his humor, when he starts, he ends up being poisoned.
I just decided not to work in the standup 'cause this thing is getting a instant payout from the whole stranger's room, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If you're trying to do this all the time, it can lead to stupidity.
I sometimes work in the "Right Air in Apollo" whenever I want, but mostly I don't get the pleasure like I used to.
I'm asking if he's going to take the stand one more time.
It's a pleasure to sit in a room with a director who helps to give shape to the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I'll ever want to give up on it.
So that's his new engagement?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice party.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place for it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public servants to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya has begun a biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the government ' s payment statement.
Employees who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid shall be reported in the Government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenya promised to reduce corruption in public structures after reaching power in 2013.
The audit had found earlier this year that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month was lost through the payment of “invisible workers” and other financial violations.
The Government suspects that salaries continue to be paid to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports BBC reporter Vanyam Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants must be present within the next two weeks in the identification centres to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, the Government statement states.
Any person who fails to do so without due cause will be expelled from the payment statement shall be reported in it.
“This procedure significantly improves the streamlining of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear a payment statement at both levels of government, thus ending the problem of “invisible workers”, said Anne Wiigur, Secretary of the Ministry of Planning and Government Structure.
Tens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with the “prescription” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “promising against the Government”, local information agencies reported.
The police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, reports Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in corruption detection activities last December, which were aimed at checking government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish policemen were arrested on suspicion of establishing an organized criminal group and hearing the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (the Prime Minister at the time) identified their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic cleric Fethol Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer canals.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenia Yacenuk took his daughter to school.
There he told the expected journalists that not all schools had been reopened, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
The first September ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful heaven over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, a huge single Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexan Pastuchov, director of the school in Slavyanska, where the daughter of Jacenuka went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be found here and that children will receive the knowledge that will be useful in their future life.
On the first day of the study, children have traditionally noticed that they wear their upper arms, hold their wings in their hands, and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, she may have found such an impressive leader as she needs.
It is followed by a wave of fame from the world of banking, media management and the internal circle of the Tori party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership.
Her career began in the consulting firm for global management of Bain and Co, and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the world of media in Pearsons.
She was head of the Financial Times for seven years, retired when a senior member of Pearson's was hired by a lower-ranking colleague.
It is said that its earnings are approaching £1 million.
Its political rating is also renewed.
She recommended David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP when he tried to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became a consultant at the Cabinet of Ministers.
Her husband's former counselor, Tori.
Earlier in May, I called the president of the poisoned glass.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two priorities: within the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but I will also stand out as a voice of public concern and concern when something goes wrong.
It is almost a duopolis that needs full radical reform.
However, what new president would risk coming, tearing up and destroying the institution as difficult as the Chinese dynamite, if he had left his job in this process.
It's a hard decision.
It would not be so difficult, many people would be happy to see how the BBC will decrease in size, after reviewing its credentials, finances and status.
As competitors are narrowing the circle and new technologies pose challenges to the delicate old habits, the inevitable negotiations on the value of the licence pose a special threat to the BBC.
For a modest amount of £145,50 a year, the British acquire a share in the world's largest media enterprise.
The BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of its work cover 96 per cent of households and each of them stands at 40p per day.
Moreover, it is evident that Beeb's popularity is growing: 53 per cent are supporting it today against 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The viewing and use models of BBC have changed: I now get news headlines on the mobile phone and watch missing programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and exciting institution.
He needs an impressive president - I hope it found him.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by someone on the side
Twitter, with a confirmed account of Governor Texas, Republican Rick Perry, had on Sunday evening an insulting image of the district prosecutor from the Democrats, who was at the centre of criminal prosecution for abuse of power.
Twitter was later removed, followed by another Perry account, in which this record was disassessed.
It's just that from my account, a tweet was published that was written by someone on the other side.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I took it off," said the later note.
Perry's assistants did not respond immediately to the request for comments.
Although the records were loaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was unclear who was actually publishing the tape.
Earlier on, the tweet contained minor cartoons for the prosecutor of Travis Rosemary Lemberg County, who was found guilty of driving in a state of depression in April 2013.
Perry made a ban on the financing of her department when she refused to resign, which led to the trial of a large jury in Austin this month against Perry, who was a potential candidate for the 2016 election.
The signature in yours says, "I don't always drive a car in a state of depression, three times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I blame Governor Perry for what he tells me about it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg authorities did not conduct an investigation involving a large jury against Perry.
They had Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry did not acknowledge himself guilty and called himself a political prisoner.
His powerful legal team had asked the judge in charge of this case to reject the indictment, claiming that the law used to prosecute a governor who had performed his duties more than anyone in the history of Texas would be in conflict with the Constitution.
Perry has stopped funding $7.5 million from state resources to the State Public Control Division, which is based in Travis district, and is pursuing corruption in the public sector of Texas, when Lemberg refused to retire.
The Veto called for an official complaint from a group of left-wing public controls.
Perry's confirmed account chain is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
By bringing the fifth party to Iowa during its 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to the news that he could get out of the game by publishing a photo of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to "normal" state.
One of London's most well-known devices warned that the real estate market in South-East England had "returned" to the normal level of activity.
The house in the capital was the subject of a lively demand and a rapidly rising price, and there was widespread fear that the credit bubble would push the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and president of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to the normal level of transactions since the peak of 2013", adding that it has provided "a stable working environment".
The London real estate market was successful during the fall, as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
Prices in the city increased by 18.5 per cent in just one year, according to the Earth inventory, by an average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices for the private, accessible and student schemes of Berkeley increased by about one fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of which have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around the potential " special " tax" before the general elections next May.
The London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, which introduced stricter loan conditions, would also lead to a decline in market growth, both in the sale of real estate and in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England showed a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June on Monday, implying further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its forecast growth in London's real estate prices for 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis that real estate price adjustment has already begun to weaken.
Transactions in the past year fell to four in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Maefer and Kensington, according to the WA Ellis.
However, the demand for a home in the capital was very beneficial for Berkeley, raising sales by more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the necessary goods with good design and the best location remained old and, reflecting this, sales remained for a time."
In June, the company reported that it sold 3742 new houses this year by the end of April - almost three times as much as in the 2007 precrisis peak.
The annual income for tax payments rose by 40 per cent compared to the previous year to £380 million, income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
On Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley reported that the expected revenues of Berkeley would be consistent with current market expectations for the year.
In the unanimous opinion of analysts, income per year is expected to be paid at £450 million.
Berkeley's stock was held at £23.96 on the second half of the day at the London Stock Exchange.
Photographs by Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by the hacker
Jennifer Lawrence attends the 85th annual award ceremony of the American Cinema Academy.
The photos of the filmed actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar award, were posted in the online hacker, which ensures that there are 100 more rising stars in the "catalogue" photographs.
The star star "Golden Games" confirmed that the photographs of Lawrence are present, and condemned the hacker for a "sudden invasion into private space".
The law enforcement authorities have been treated and will be prosecuted by anyone who publishes stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photos originally posted on the 4chan photo exchange site were probably obtained due to the lack of the Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalogue" of the victims of the breach includes the names of dozens of women, including Ryanna, Kim Cardassian, Mary Elizabeth Winston and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's not clear how many of these photographs are real, although the Scott Pilgrim star against all of them, Winsted in Twitter, also condemned the breach.
"The one who looks at the photos that we took with his husband a few years ago when he came home, I hope you're proud," says Winsted on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victoria-survivor" protested that on the photos she wrote in Twitter: "These so-called photos that I was caught by FALSHIVIKI, people.
Let me stop this at the birth.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the representative of the pop-star Ariana Grande denied that the photos she was supposed to be real.
An exclusive extract from the new novel by Howard Jacobson about the love and the letter "J", which brought praise to critics
They were dissolved, the best they could say is, they were gradually dissolved like a cardboard box that was left under the rain.
Only at times did the woman tell him that he was too serious, heavy in society, tense, closed, and maybe a little annoying.
And then she took his hand.
He saw anger in him.
He was rolling like a string, yeah.
The last victim of this colostrum was a little novel he expected more than usual, deliverance from lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was horrified by the fragile beauty of her hair and herring heart from the northern island village, even more distant and rough than Port Rhoyben.
She came to the south with a satellite older than Kevern considered her aunt, and the last one had a home of cheese, but looked like a paradise valley called the Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for a few years.
The tubs, which were constantly sitting in the tubs, left their trails in all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden grew with thorns like giant baskets.
It was like a cot from a children's book, at the same time frightening and charming, full of mystery garden.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the long list of Bucharest Prizes in 2014.
The short list will be announced next week
Kevern and Eileen sat down, held by hand, in sloated sleighs among the high grass, enjoying the unexpected hot spring day; they both sat quietly on the cheap console that provided the country with dying music and soothing news, when looking at its twisted brown legs, he remembered the old song of a long forgotten black performer who loved to listen to his father, leaving the towers in the house.
You've got too big legs.
Because of their aggression, such songs on the consoles were no longer played.
They were not prohibited - nothing was prohibited - they were not played anymore.
They've been helped to become archaic, just like the word "archaic."
The public taste has done something that would never be achieved by orders and regulations, and just as people among the books have chosen rich, poor, culinary, and love novels, they have chosen ballads from all of the music.
As it turned out, Kevern began to play on the imaginary piano and the rough comical voice of Elynn's big legs.
Eileen didn't get it.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he said to her, putting two fingers in her pockets.
So his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she got out of his mouth.
It started out with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father was playing in it with his father, as he told him.
Start with "J" and forget to apply two fingers to your mouth, and it'll be worth a penny to you.
It wasn't very fun at the time, and it wasn't very fun right now.
He knew they were waiting for him, that's all.
He had to explain what a jazz was.
Eileen never heard of him.
Jaz didn't play either, even though he wasn't open.
The improvisation is out of fashion.
There's only one "if" in life.
When the melody began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
We're doing exactly the same thing.
His unpredictability had a negative effect on people’s nerves.
And jazz was an instrument expressed by music.
Although he was 10 years old, he never heard of Sammy Davis Young, Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret compact disc collection.
But even if he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Considering her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no law or pressure.
The community was obedient, and this meant that each of its segments agreed with gratitude - thanks to those who had preserved their destiny - with the principle of group readiness.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin on temperature and physical characteristics had a good approach to entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
The Indians, as if they were talented in everything about electronics, assumed that no family would be left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was a work of santechnics; what was left of the Greek was plates.
Exiters from the Persian Gulf and Levant, whose grandfathers did not hesitate to leave the country, when the TO, what had been the case, had been the case, in fear of being accused of burning flames, in fear of saying that the flame would swallow them the following, had opened the restaurants with spasms and caliphs, had not set up and flowed away.
Everyone's capable.
Since she had heard only the ballads before, Eileen found it hard to understand how insulting words that she had just heard could be put on music.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're really not insulting," said Kevern.
Is that possible for people who have big legs?
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the garden that was started gave him a sense of security.
No word could go through the soundproofing of giant leafy leaves.
Eileen didn't understand.
How could your father love such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he didn't want to use it again to lose two fingers.
She thought it was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She raised her head unbelievably, closing the Qevera review.
There was nothing in the world except the dust of her black hair.
Nothing I'd like to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, in her opinion.
But that doesn't explain why you eat it to me anyway.
It turns out she's really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The drawers, maybe they can hear...
And you're saying you hate me because my boots are too fat?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but that was too early.
"I like you because you've got fat boots," he said instead.
I've got that kind of delusion.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to shoot often led him into an awkward situation because, like his father, he lacked the calming promise that could alleviate the cruelty that had been inflicted on him.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevin, wanted it.
In spite of the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons adorned and stood up from the Shezlonga, twisted the console and poured the wine they drank.
Wine from the bush, so the potion could not serve as his excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed to be shaking like palm leaves in the hurricane.
"And I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
You don't like it, though.
He felt sorry for her and for the excessive rudeness of her words, and for the fear that appeared in her view when she gave her resistance.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in a cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that she was basically like this.
The same huge ice ocean had broken down on both of them.
The same men, even more sensitive and capricious after all, than their ancestors, smugglers, and destroyers, were ready to raise their hand against any woman who would ridicule them or insult them.
A stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid doll if she wasn't careful!
The first kiss - the kiss now became the most common expression of erotic anger between a man and a woman; the opposite of the fresh ballads that issued the console first kissed her and then hit her.
A bit of an exaggeration, I think, because kissing yourself was already a hooligan.
Eileen Solomons' corpus showed that he had to leave.
He got up out of a schizophrenia like an old man.
She felt the weight of a pig herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him walk away, and from the top of the window, she watched him walk away, her satellite is a man who's putting on his own weight.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt compassion for him and for men at all, even though some of them had raised their hand.
The man who turned away from her, with a bent back, bent, beaten, all his ability to fight left him; why did she think that she knew so well if she could not remember any of the cases until today when she saw such a thing?
Once again, one of Eileen Solomons looked at his feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, or about that Esme Nusbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked in Ofnau, an informal community-controlled service, prepared a small report on the conservation of low and medium-level violence in the same parts of the country, where it was expected that it would be reduced if it did not cease, taking into account the resources and forces allocated to its eradication.
"Many have been done, and much has been done," she wrote, "to alleviate the vicious aggression of the people who fought in thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these scattered vineyards and narrow settlements, where, despite the ravages of church caves, the gentle breathing of human kindness rarely felt throughout history.
However, some qualities are irrevocable.
The higher the mirror, the lower the passion it produces.
The population flows through the valleys of sentimental balloons, swallows up the history of obstacles and proclaims its lack of faith in a good marriage and family life, but not only the old brutality continues to be strong enough both in rural communities and in urban settlements, but also there is evidence that new and evil hostility is born in homes, in workplaces, in roads and even in playgrounds.
"You have a boring habit of writing too much," her scientific manager said, reading the whole report.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum has lost her head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I'm responsible," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
It's quiet again.
"I ask," Luther Rabinovic finally said, "not because I oppose atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have any preconceptions here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitive, absolutely acceptable and self-appreciating, may sometimes distort the results, such as what you showed me.
Obviously, you're against the church yourself, and what you call "bad" and "bad", others would interpret as an expression of natural love and energy.
To continue to give in to what it has been like, as if it had happened, yesterday, means to leave the country that it needed to live.
Esme Nussbaum looked at the sides while Rabinovic spoke.
On his head roses, like flamingo, were repeated by the lighted letters that Ofnau gave to the country in the last four centuries or more.
Smile to your neighbor, your wife's prices, listen to the ballads, go to the music, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
A word of silence is better, a word of song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better to love.
"I fully understand what you're trying to say," said Esme Nusbaum quietly, when she realized that her scientist had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't been treated as effectively as we believe.
I am concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we repeat the mistakes that have originally led to the PROCEEDINGS.
Only this time will we throw out our anger and not trust in others.
Luther Rabinovic put together the ends of his fingers in the pyramid.
This gesture must have meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "called the "mistakes" of actions that our grandfathers have done or have not done.
You go too far and when you talk about how they've thrown out their anger and their lack of trust in others.
In your place, a person should not be reminded that, in the past, that is the protection of the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them".
There was no "us" and there was no "other".
It was a time of unrest, that's all we know.
"For which, if you're honest with yourself," he dared to insert Esme, "not a part of society can justify itself well.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what it did was done.
Then it was.
There's nothing more to say - here we agree.
And no one has to blame, no one has to justify it if it's appropriate or if there's something to be corrected.
But why did it happen if it wasn't for learning -
The past is for us to forget it.
If I could add one word to that,
The pyramid of Luther Rabinovica is broken.
"I'll consider your record," he said, leaving it.
The next day, on his way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who went on a road trip, as described by the passage, “in an angry rage”.
There's a coincidence.
Army Lesotho claims that the coup was not planned; the prime minister remains in South Africa
The representatives of the Lesotho army objected to the reversing of the Government, claiming that they had acted against the police, who were suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the country ' s army had surrounded his official residence and had seized government buildings in Maseru capital.
The Prime Minister brought his family into neighboring South Africa, claiming that he had been threatened with temptation for his life.
Major Ntlele Ntoi's army said it was not really a coup, but that the army responded to the threat of the "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces has taken action, having received several reconnaissance reports that there are some elements among the police that are really planning to arm some political, young fanatic political parties who were prepared to create chaos," he told the Voice of America.
A representative of the South African Government, Clayson Monella, said that the army's actions looked like a turning point.
"No one has ever made a claim to take over the power, according to all information, of the actions of the Lesotho armed forces at the present time have major signs of a coup," he said.
Lesotho army officials reported that the soldiers had returned to the barracks on Sunday and that in the capital, they had calmed down.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motejoa Metsing is running the Government in the absence of Taban.
Taban stated that he believed that he was being attacked in an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Taban has suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in its united Government.
He stated that his actions had not been undermined by the Government, despite the charges in return.
Col. Chelsea, Marco van Ginkel will hold the upcoming season on the right to rent in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutch will arrive in Italy in the next few hours for a medical examination.
In the past season, he went to the London Club field only three times.
Remember, Milan had previously rented to the Liverpool attacker Fernando Torres.
Production in eurozone at the lowest rate in 13 months
Production growth in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest rate of 13 months in August, according to popular research.
The latest value of the business activity index (PMI) of the euro area production sector on Markit fell to 50.7 in August, with a decrease of 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were held, and businesses were affected by the growing tension between the EU and Russia in relation to Ukraine.
The European Central Bank (ECB) meeting was held on Thursday.
Markets will expect the Bank to have a clear plan on how to stop the recovery of the eurozone, as well as the risk of inflation of 0.3 per cent.
There is a assumption that the ECB's head, Mario Dragi, can give additional signals later this week, that he is considering a scheme of quantitative reductions for the eurozone, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than any growth, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more evident," said Rob Dobson, senior economist Markit.
Germany's production sector SME, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest in 11 months of note 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second-largest economy of the block, France, SMEs fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause the present concern, as well as the weakening of Italy from stable growth to stagnation.
Recognising that the impulse to increase emissions in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, does not add certainty," said Mr. Dobson.
The slowing of the industry is likely to be further fuelled by analysts who expect additional monetary or budgetary incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where SMEs grew to 57.3 at their highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the chief economist of IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the August Index of Business Activity of the Eurozone industry is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: " Eurozone producers are obviously living very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - especially that of Russia/Ukraine - adds uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit the business - and especially the confidence of consumers - and is likely to result in some orders being detained or even cancelled, especially major orders.
He said that "more and more like," that the ECB would eventually have to carry out some variety of quantitative mitigation, "we want to suspect that it will be limited."
The people of Mariupola display a live chain against the policemen
In Mariúpolis, before last week, everything was quiet — no one was going to organize the Mariúpolis People’s Republic, the city lived and worked on the Asian Sea.
Now people are looking forward to the arrival of the policemen.
According to politicians, separatists are breaking down to Mariúpolis to go to the Azov Sea, a city recently taken by Novozazovsk, which has not previously been part of the self-declared republics.
The Mariuples decided that the Ukrainian army, although to protect them, would have a little power against the well-armed representatives of the DND-LNA, and gathered to assist the military.
They're rocking the ground, building the blocks and strengthening.
On Saturday evening, a few thousand people came to the eastern border of the city and stood there in a live tub, singing the hymns of Ukraine.
They are going to do the same when they arrive.
Volunteers collect and drive equipment and products, collect medicines, publish the paper.
In the city, shops are gradually closed, banks and ATMs are shut down.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years of the cruel capture of school, like the children who have been in it, are still suffering.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostages by Chechen fighters at a school in Beslane, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were killed during this three-day trial, which shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who lied to death during the crime at school.
Ten years later, after the horrendous adoption of the wireless school, during which 334 people were killed, including 186 children, the heroic survivors were warned yesterday evening about the new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, this seemed to be a kind of extreme possible evil.
The tragedy brought the East and the West together in the revolution, which then miraculously increased in action and hope for the future in the face of the worst tribulation.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who had lied to death during the crime at school.
We have found wonderful young people who have faced adversity, although the memories of the terrorist Ada will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now being waged by Ukraine, in which children like them are being killed, will now end.
A girl who is trying to get back to the shooting sports hall
It was printed in a picture of a well-known Russian photographer, Dmitria Belakova, when a white man tried to get back to the shooting sports hall after the mine exploded.
Aida was desperate for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
They were afraid they died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run behind all the forces, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
Soldiers improved her and took her to a safe place.
After the surgery, she thought she had completely recovered, but yesterday she said, "Thirty months ago, pain has returned.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
There's a couple of scissors left on my knees.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people the way doctors helped her.
"It's a tragedy that changed my life, but she certainly didn't break it," she says with a challenge.
"This has happened to me, and this cannot be changed.
Once a year, I always go to this sports hall to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it the other day.
It's too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my roommate, was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my schooling and start working.
I think about the family then.
She said that the memory remained with her, although the memories were a little dusty every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our misery, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see an Internet photo, where I go to the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and do it so that it doesn't happen anymore.
The boy who ran through a bullet fence, thinking his mother was dead.
It was his first day in school (the Russians started school at age 7) and survived three days of capture, covering their mother Tamara.
Then he had seven, and he said, "My mother said to me, 'If it is an explosion, keep her by the hand.'
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She told him to run.
Fearing that she was dead, he ran away and saw a crying little boy on the road, caught the child by the hand, and ran through the city with a bullet.
His father, Vladimir, who caught his son outside, said, "Damir told me his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in a hospital with leg injuries, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After they were reunited, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now missing News of the World), where he was rewarded as Child Protection Officer from the Barnardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"That horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can tell you that I remember him screaming.
I remember how soon after that, I fired all my toys.
But now I can play computer games with a gun, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played in the court that I didn't choose.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially a toy shop, where I was allowed to choose everything I wanted, and to travel in an open-air car.
But now he's afraid of places like Ukraine where wars lead to a mountain that he and his friends have survived.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who last week was doing volunteer work in a women's monastery.
That's how I want to help.
I want to serve with the police sometime, and I hope they'll take me to the Academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the bitter silence immediately after the arrest, there were just no children who would scream and run around, and that silence continued for months.
She'll remember her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I realized that people at the other end of the earth could understand our feelings and support them.
She was grateful "Sherry Blair and her fund for that award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember seeing her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember how when Damir wanted to eat the boat, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the officers at the restaurant, Damir shot them out of his water gun, and they ran and played with him.
And the whole month went after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I don't think this world has been better than these 10 years.
Now there's a war going on in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and killed.
They're just children like ours.
I think for many people, war is a news report that they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy with something else.
I just know that these people feel terrible about it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he was not aggressive or evil at all.
He's not looking for places, for example, he's not surrounded by this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they're going to the sports hall from time to time and they're burning candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it. I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw out all his weapons and other military toys, and now he's 17, he's above me, nice, smart and healthy.
I find it hard to believe that I've been so sure for a few hours that he's dead and that I'll never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked at the hell around me when parts of the body were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember screaming to him, "Damir, run, run," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
This life continues for us, unlike so many others.
Georgie Ilin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photo after the capture became a decisive for the tragedy in Beslane
Room: survivor of Beslan Georgie Ilin with his mother Fatima after her arrest in 2004, and Georgia's case today
His wounded face was the impression of fear when he was saved from death when the Czech terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, in 54 years of age, took him to school on the first day of school before taking the older son of Vladimir to university.
"I left in two minutes before the terrorists ran into the court, so my little boy stayed one for three days of nightmare," she recalled.
Not even one, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia was able to survive.
The closer that date, the harder it is to think about and talk about it.
It's not a day when we don't remember that tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some of the scenes of those days always in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
He is in the soul: the photograph of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was eternal in sculpture (right)
I remember Georgie so wanted to go to school on the day she said she wanted to hug the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And even now there's a sculpture of Georgia crying in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like to look at this picture, and she's hidden in the bookstore at our house.
I understand, but I also feel that because of this photograph, people around the world feel our pain.
Georgia now says, "It's important that it never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boing violation in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what it was called?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, they don't want war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need ten years to forget her a little.
She influenced my health, and I still feel it.
I've had nightmares about three or four years, but now it's better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this sports hall before 1 September.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go into the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget about it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life is going on.
I graduated from school this year and went to a medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'll learn to be a cardiosurgery.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
Georgie Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived, despite being in the foot of a terrorist.
It's amazing, George Farniev was in the foot of a terrorist in the time of his capture, but he survived.
At the time of his arrest, he was photographed in a sports room next to a bomb in the foot of a terrorist killer.
Actually, it's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday," said Georgie, who wanted to study at the FSB intelligence officer, but failed because of the damage caused by his health at the time of his arrest.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they're saying that kids are easily dealing with bad things, and I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005, for the next year, I was the first and last time I entered this sports hall again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show where I was sitting on this famous photograph.
Survivor: Georgie Farniev today with an open photo on her notebook in the hospital after the arrest
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
With regard to physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm going okay.
But health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical opinions, and they answered that it was impossible.
My second involvement was animals, so I went to a veterinary institute.
I've been studying there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from basket to basket."
He said, "I know that I will never tell my children about my experiences.
This is not what children should know, and of course not what they should survive.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to commemorate it.
I know Georgie won't go.
She's got to be even stronger for him because he was there, and I didn't.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help it.
I'm so grateful to God that he's back to me.
He's staying with us.
Georgia is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so awfully unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't handle it because of his knees.
He's had several operations, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he'd overcome this nightmare by 50%, but it's impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This sad experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and that only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people that I knew well and that were my way.
My son with me, and this is the best gift God could have done to me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who have never married again.
It's hard to assume that life is going on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart broke out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world, wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I find it hard to believe in it.
We were a friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and a lot will be killed.
If you could catch all the rebels and throw them out, as far as you can.
Alona Ckaeva, 10 years old
A young man who has been gently taken to a safe place by a team of experts
Rescue: Alonu Ckaevu is carrying a Russian sword of expertise (left) in a safe place.
She now has ten (right), and she does not even remember the horrific crime
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alona was taken out of the Russian police station in Beslane.
The terrorists let her go, but they cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, Christine's ten-year-old sister and Brother Mahara in the school gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, survived, but Alona's mother and sister died in a deadly battle.
Her father, Ruslan, has been remarried since then, and they have a little daughter with his new wife, Svetlana, whom he called Christine in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alona, now ten, who remembers nothing about taking and flourishing in a smart and happy girl, is talking to her neighbors.
"They are a great happy family now, and Alon and Mahar are both beautiful children," said a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.
Sinzi Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dormouse in Beirut, said that he was looking forward to being able to go back to the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyful event in the career.
Of course, I am very glad that I will play for the "Borusia" again, says Mr. Kagawa.
I feel really good.
A field of positive emotions and impatiently waiting, when I can go back to the field in the form of "Borusia".
Remember, Kagawa moved to the MOU from Beirut in 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to join the English club for two seasons, performing a total of 38 matches in the English championship, killing 6 matches and delivering 8 successful broadcasts.
A man indicted on a girl's walk on a "pelican" walk at Fife
A 78-year-old man will be brought before the prosecution court for a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian walk to Fife.
Gordon Stuart was supposed to beat a girl on a trip to Pittenwin in East Newke.
The prosecutors said that Mr. Stuart had taken his Audi Q3 without proper care and attention and had beaten a girl, which resulted in trauma.
Stuart, 78, from Antwerp, denied his guilt at the Dandy Sheriff's Court of Justice.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a royal lawyer, appointed the date of the court in January.
Obama, Merkel, and Holland are not retiring in Vladivostok
The Vladivostok Free Airport Free Trade Store has issued a card prohibiting the purchase of a number of world political leaders.
Don't show them the spirits, the water, and the horse.
The store administration decided that the President of the United States, Barack Obama, Chancellor FRG Angela Merkel, President of France, France, France, Vitaly Clicko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other well-known associates would not be able to play in their store by water, horse and spirits.
And put the corresponding tablet on the door.
Obama had previously received a ban on the presence in the less accessible form of the establishment service - Diet Tables of the ICU, as reported by the site of the headquarters.
Whether the U.S. President had a dream of ever eating at a diet table in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the ban seem to be horrendous themselves.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Bear advised the agrarians
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the embargo, Russian agrarians should develop new technologies in order to establish the issuances required of the cheese varieties buyers.
The Council was the day of a visit to the company "Ygpticeprom" Agrocomplex".
The Government ' s head also advised the restaurants to refocus on the Russian meat, which is of a proper quality.
The annual food import embargo has been introduced in Russia since 7 August.
The main coach of the Russian assembly Valentin Maslakov is pleased with the outcome of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, third place is a good result, given the lack of targeted training for competitions.
Our athletes spoke at their level, saying, "All sports" Masalakow.
Third place is the confirmation of our sufficiently high level of command.
It is pleased that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
We must bear in mind that we have not prepared for these competitions.
The season is over, and we have not committed our leaders to participating in the DecaNation match.
In recent years we have become second to this tournament, but in this season we have a collection renewed.
On the contrary, the French have displayed a military team, including 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which has been announced many times in public.
But even such a set of rivals could not resist the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have spoken in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were in order below the same Brilliant League.
Season's over.
Of course, sportsmen are no longer so important, even more so in the team-level competitions.
The main place here was the place.
And according to the results, there was an absurdity when at 1500 m men were so involved with tactical throttles that they showed the result below the average level... of women's escapes.
4 Tips on improving the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to take a photo or take a video under the water, there are a number of options in front of you.
The cheapest option is the waterproof "mower", for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an ex-camera, for example, GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I made these photos at a family holiday with a few cameras, all at about $350.
Regardless of what equipment you are using, several rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other compartments are fully closed.
Also, set your camera for that type of photo or video that you're going to take.
Some cameras have collection modes or object types that optimize exposure to dark underwater conditions.
And before you get into the water, find out how deep your equipment can go.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our buyer's leadership and digital cameras ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few pictures, because many of them won't get.
The "moulds" have a ZCD that will help you compose the photos, when they don't usually have the echo camera.
Even if you have a ZCD, it will be difficult to see it under the water, and the staffing will be a random process.
So make a few staffs.
Also, if your camera has a serial collection system that takes a few staff with a few different exposure facilities, take advantage of them.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light decreases significantly more deeply than you dive under the water.
If possible, stay on the surface when you are taking pictures of the pool, the river or the ocean.
This will also allow you to pass more colors on the photos; the deeper you go, the less the color you see.
Swim closer to the collection facilities.
It is a great council for landfilling, but it is even more important under water because of the dark light conditions.
Especially important if you are filming on an ex-camera: This device is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means that you will have to approach the collection objects if you want to fill in the frame.
The 2012 Bronze Preser of the Olympic Games, after the free struggle of Bill Mahov, can go into a Greek-Roman struggle.
This was reported by the chief coach of the Dagestan assembly for the free struggle of Sagid Sagid.
The specialist did not exclude the participation of a sportsman at the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
Bill Mahov is currently on the team of "classics", says "R-Sport" Sajida Sajidova.
In fact, as a youth, Bill spoke both ways.
At the 2005 youth world championship, he became the winner of the volleyball tournament and the third prize in the Greek-Roman contests and decided to focus on free fighting.
There has been a long conversation that the new stage of our career will be arduous in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll say more: Mahov can go to the world championship in Tashkent if he wins the prize.
But the decisive word always for the coaching headquarters in the head with Gogi Koguasville.
Andrew Lowson was such a person that the power of the person could have pushed everything around, even in a giant organization such as the National Health Service.
The consultant anesthesiologist devoted his career to rid the sick of both the pain and the pain of the treatment.
Among those who spoke to him, his wife recalled, he was an officer of the MI-6 who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Louson realized that while the doctor is involved in diagnosis and illness, those who are being treated mainly worry about something else.
Once in 2007, however, he proved to be the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel like I used to," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength.
Fighting with flu-like symptoms, he found that his wife, Juliet, was bitterly opposed.
"I want things to happen faster, not later," he remarked.
When Juliet left for business on a weekly basis, Louson found out that he was unusually upset and unresolved.
Something's wrong.
He asked his colleague to do the X-ray of the chest cell.
Two weeks earlier, he had been on a cliff in the French Alps.
X-ray results came in.
It was a mesothelioma, untreated cancer that affects the pelvis, or a cloud of light.
For most cancers, it is difficult to identify the exact cause.
Although some smokers suffer from mild cancer, for example, they do not all suffer from mild cancer.
But with a mesothelioma other than that.
In almost every case, the reason is contact with asbestos, a volcanic building material that was once called "miracle", but which, as it is now known, is deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, at the end of the day, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial ban entered into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipelines, builders, landowners and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era is hardly a cause for concern today.
But such a calmness is wrong.
Britain, it seems, is at the peak of the epidemic of mesothelioma.
More people die from mesothelioma than in any other country on the planet.
In the annual death of about 2,500 people, more than twice as many die from this disease as a result of car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and forecast number of future deaths in Britain
The reason why we feel its deadly effects now is that, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos have finally been banned by law in 1999), mesotheliomas are usually ten years old.
And to attack mesotheliomas is not limited to veterans of industrial construction.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, placed at home where we live, offices where we work, schools where we learn, and shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to the class, level of supply, profession or age.
Election pools, from modern London universities to private schools, as it turns out, have not been saved.
Parliament's building is reduced by asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are meant to treat us were the reservoirs of this deadly cancer.
Andrew Lowson wasn't old.
He wasn't a piper.
In fact, he had to think about where he could get into contact with asbestos.
Then he did the same.
"It seems that there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels in the Guyana hospital, where I spent six years in the internship," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors, and truckers used these tunnels.
Interestingly, how many of my nurses get the same disease?
That was a question for which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Among the four doctors who have been in Gaia's hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I have remained alive."
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lowson was diagnosed with mesotheloma when he was 48.
When he died on 17 February of this year, he was 55.
It's been such a long time.
Fifty per cent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
She's always mortal.
So now we can just say, "How many of us are going to get the same disease?"
According to the leading expert on mesothelioma in Britain, Professor Julian Pito, it is likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is to survive, some 90,000 people will die.
Most of them don't seem to die like this.

A brief review of reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the attacks of mesothelioma have been spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janis Ellen had been exposed to asbestos without inspection.
She worked on the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, with the two - story clothing departments, one of which was the chief store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over 20 years of age.
"As it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't even think it'd touch me.
A lot of people really know about asbestos.
I mean, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They received their name from the word “asbestiform”, which means a volcanic structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotil, widely known as white asbestos, is much more frequent in buildings today.
It was used in the blood panels, in the middle of the plate, in the thermalization of the tubes, in the wheels, even in the brake pads of the cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage”, which may lead to death.
More dangerous, however, is brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (croquidolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there are strong, although there are clear reasons to believe that this is the main cause of a very high number of mesothelioma patients [in Britain]".
Marks & Spencer was influenced by asbestos at Oxford Street, London Alami's main store.
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is not unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “a substantial percentage of mesotheliers, when there is no known effect on work or home, were likely due to the effects of asbestos from the environment”.
Most of this effect, he said, is due to the "normal use and impact of the weather" on our buildings.
Nobody seems to be sure he's safe.
The report of Goddard Consulting, in which the Westminster Palace was considered, demonstrates how people, even at the government centre, could be affected unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical shafts and pipelines behind the parliamentary committees were contaminated by asbestos, which could lead to something as innocent as “strong air flows”.
Members of Parliament often accuse themselves of pursuing their own interests, but in that case it seems to be true.
Although the Parliament's Technical Service Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "pure health certificate", she now recognized that work of £1 billion on the reconstruction of Parliament should be carried out by improving electricity and removal of asbestos, and that, after the 2015 general elections, members of Parliament might be sitting at the QE2 conference near the Westminster Greens.
Goddard noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed in accordance with different rules”.
It is not possible to know if this error of management will stand.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who couldn't find out how to contact the asbestos is Graham Ebbott, a doctor of common practice.
Like Andrew Lowson, Ebbott, 50 years old, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that was successfully conducted searches for asbestos," he said, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked, and the dates.
That he remembers clearly, so that day in early December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late at night.
All of a sudden, I started to get sick.
It started very fast.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Ebbott knew that pain was coming from the pelvis, the envelopes around the legs.
But, like Janice Ellen, he just had no reason to suspect a mesothelite.
Finally, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Unsuspected doctors made X-rays of the chest and placed pleural catheters to extract liquid from the lungs and send it to the analysis.
Still, his condition remained undiagnosed.
He gradually improved his health and returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he had taken sports and had severe breathing.
In 2011, one of Ebbott's patients came to him with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
However, even then Abbott did not link it to his own case.
Finally, his patient was ten years older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection was obvious in this case.
In September 2011, the condition of Ebbotta deteriorated again, and his consultant showed the results of the CTC and X-rays of the team of experts.
In December 2011, just two years after Ebbott began to feel bad, a sensor equipped with a camera was introduced into a gap between his chest cell and his easy shell.
I'm optimistic.
I'm usually just going on," he says.
I didn't worry too much about it, I'm honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy result came on Sunday between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Gram Ebbott: Diagnosis of mesothelioma
Ebbott suddenly arrived at a meeting with Macmillan's nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
That is when he realized the magnitude of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermalization on pipes has been quite often," he says.
People who have been affected by asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma is now affecting more young people in atypical profession.
The most dangerously isolated asbestos tubes in the hospitals were in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients would be affected.
But many staff who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (such as Andrew Lowson), or to drink in double tables (as Grim Ebbott has often done) are almost likely to be affected by the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for patients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of doctors who treated them.
It is still being removed today.
Schoolers set up their Bunzen fires on asbestos grounds
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and Marys because of their amazing isolation and fire-fighting characteristics.
Schools, too.
In fact, many were likely first exposed to the influence of asbestos in the class.
Throughout the country, for countless lessons in chemistry, schoolchildren set up their Bunzen fires on asbestos grounds.
Web sites have appeared to focus on the issue of asbestos in schools.
In the meantime, in our homes, such harmless things as a blanket or a roof of the Sarav usually contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison that is placed in a large number of our ranks," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lauson in a case against the Hague hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the sage of the garden sara in the 1970s.
Therefore, be careful about gardening.
The effect of the diagnosis when you know that the disease is incurable is huge.
"To realize it, it's been a long time," says Graham Ebbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I had to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not gonna meet Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the medical situation to the patient.
As an unaccountable number of patients before him, he will remember how much information had to be received.
"It was hard to understand everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
They gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesotheloma is particularly dangerous, because it's the mechanic of how we support life, the only act of breathing, is the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
The asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is destroyed and the fibers breathe, they can be stuck in the pelvis, the envelopes of the light.
The asbestos fibers provoke the pleural and may cause cell mutations.
“The problem is due to the inhalation of the carbon fibers of asbestos,” Professor Tom Treger, a cardiovascular surgeon who arrived in the hospital in Guyana in 2001.
That's the hospital, where, as Andrew Lowson suspected, he was affected by asbestos, now by the ironic fate of the mesothelioma treatment center.
The coach knew Louson and treated some others who were probably affected by being in the hospital.
When the asbestos needles fall into the soft tissues, the Treger says, "the breath of them pushes them into the periphery where the shell is.
It's, in fact, an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is causing heated disputes.
Some people think it's worth a try.
The trigger doesn't agree.
"It's impossible to cut the apple," he says.
It's impossible to get around her with a knife.
However, this cancer “is not very well tolerated by chemotherapy”, which “acts”, but does not cure.
"From time to time, there are people who have been sick for a long time," says Treger.
But eventually, they're all dying.
Fortunately, some patients live a lot, much longer than they expect.
Author Steven Jay Gold died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Grem Ebbott continues to fight.
After he had been a mesothelioma patient, Ebbotta was introduced to Andrew Lowson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became a single office of support and consultation for the same patients.
"Hello, Central Rock," he was very happy when they called.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
At first, Ebbottu was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and prolong his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lowson, however, "was reluctant to give it a little more positive. "
After meeting several specialists, Ebbot decided to continue treatment with Professor Loik Lang-Lazduński, professor of chest surgery in the Hague hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need direction, I just called them, and they took me," he admits.
The median statistical patient would have to receive direction and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role in mesothelioma patients to get better from the available treatments.
However, when such treatment is ultimately ineffective, many sufferers face yet another financial cause for concern about the future of their families.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lowson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," Morgan says.
But what's changed in the 1960s is that it became clear that even very small numbers could be at risk.
That's when they talked about the company's mistrust.
Andrew Lowson and the Gaia Hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a "full-value settlement", according to Morgan, since Louson was unable to prove clearly that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with the asbestos in the Gaia Hospital.
After investigating his death, the representative of the Hague hospital confirmed, however, that “absorbing in the double rooms mentioned had been removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lauson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, to connect death to asbestos to one company or place of work, usually decades later, has become a major problem for patients with mesothelioma requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers changed or closed the owner.
The fear archives could have been lost.
And those who are protected from the charges know that there is no time for the complainants.
In response this year, serious new legislation has emerged, which facilitates the recovery of compensation with mesothelioma, even if it is impossible for former employers to follow.
Under that law, a fund of £350 million was established financed by the insurance industry for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who could prove to be contacted but who were not to be tried.
In such cases, the sick will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could judge in the usual case of compensation of approximately £1200.
About 300 successful claims under the scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million is “very good work” for the insurance industry.
“This is a contract written by insurers for insurers,” he said, with the fear that the amount would be a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if they had not interfered with the temporary interval and the mesothelioma patients could follow the company and claim the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Pension, admitted that the law was "incomplete".
However, both Penning and Morgan recognize that, when seven people die every day, quick action was needed.
"People are suffering so much, and they need help today," Penning said at Bill's second reading on mesothelioma last December.
By then, Graham Ebbott had been in the hands of Professor Loika Lang-Lazduński for 19 months.
Following the initial consultations, Lang-Lazduński recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Trežer, he considered to be effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lang-Lazdunski can be praised by 40 per cent of the survivors of the five-year-olds.
Ebbott felt a sense of strength.
"This, of course, is one of the most important things," said Ebbot.
You see that in patients all the time.
There's some kind of force that supports you.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Graham Ebbott is in operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
The following scans have not shown any signs of disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There was a couple of hooks in my chest.
I just had to do 50.
It's not a life threat.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of a storm.
However, this process was both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things -- finance when I die, for example, or what a woman needs to show how a timer works on a bowler.
When you get bad news, you become unhappy.
We need to look forward.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Temzin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how to say a lot.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I'm not going to get old.
They responded very differently.
Themzin is very general and energetic.
She told all her friends, and many of us called very quickly.
Ellie was more detained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something to be faced with with with all the painful cancer.
But for mesothelioma patients, such discussions are not balanced with hope, even with a difficult chance of survival.
This disease carries with it the dark certainty of Stephen Jay Guld.
As Andrew Morgan says, “mesotheloma is not a threat to life.
The bodies of the embalmed Pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos cloths.
The asbestos fibers are used to strengthen the shell and increase the temperature.
The River Older describes asbestos.
Now there's a canvas that's not burning.
I've seen the soaps made of it hanging in the fireplaces on the benches.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to produce paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Major asbestos mines are being opened in Canada and South Africa and soon thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It's the perfect heater for a pair of motors and an industrial revolution turbine.
The world's production of asbestos increases by more than 30,000 tons per year.
Prudential statistics identify premature mortality among those who work with asbestos and are therefore denied life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw is dying in Rochedale.
Dr. William Cook points out that the asbestos particles in her lungs "were, without a doubt, the main cause of death."
It's the first case of this guy.
The employees of Kershaw, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not accept responsibility.
No compensation is paid.
During World War II, there was an intensive development of shipping, one of the most deadlyly dangerous professions in terms of contact with asbestos.
Voluntary industrial ban on imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for health damage caused by asbestos contact in the United Kingdom.
The world's production of asbestos increases by more than 4213000 tons per year.
UK imports 139000 tonnes.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Security in Britain requires all asbestos contractors to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the United Kingdom.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in Britain.
An act on mesothelioma was adopted in Britain.
The compensation scheme of £350 million was announced.
asbestos is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is about 2 million tonnes per year.
China refuses to grant Hong Kong the right to elect leaders; protestants will take revenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to apply for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reform.
This is likely to lead to long-term protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing at the time considered after that statement.
The decision of the All-China People ' s Assembly, in fact, enables Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It has not fooled our expectations, but it still provokes anger," said legislator Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
It's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
In defending China's decision, Li Fay, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the All-China People's Assembly, said that allowing for the international election of Hong Kong leader would be too "hootic".
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom transferred control over Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people of the region to vote in favour of the Government, starting in 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision taken on Sunday as a democratic step forward, as it gave the Congolese the right to a direct vote; however, the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the assistance of the commission of candidates closely controlled from Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision was taken after the summer, when one of the largest and most popular protests in Hong Kong had taken place for many years.
Much of Hong Kong's pro-democracy campaign is worth the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to overrun Hong Kong's financial area if Beijing does not guarantee this universal electoral right.
On Sunday evening, just a few hours after the statement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered under the rain in front of the headquarters of the Hong Kong Government.
At the demonstrations, the organizers stated that their movement was moving into a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise in protests in the weeks to come.
However, they have not reported details, obviously trying to avoid problems with public authorities.
In the online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “considered the possibility of taking over the central area only as an exceptional measure, which can only be taken if all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are very sad to announce that, to date, all dialogue options have been exhausted and the central area is undoubtedly being seized.
The State authorities in Hong Kong prepared for Beijing's statement a few days, and security measures were strengthened in the Government headquarters on Sunday, involving police and barricades.
Many in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The flow of the population with the mother increases competition in the field of goods and services.
It is also growing in fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticise the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations are at risk of business, a source of living force in Hong Kong.
"The pity they are talking about can lead to great economic damage, depending on how many people will be involved for how long," said Regina Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We do not want the concern that Hong Kong is out of control.
It's a presentation that's bad for investment.
Chinese public media have also reported on the last days in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement have been shown by the divers sent by the Western Powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest demonstrations in the history of the region.
The U.S. culture of baseball is a university life: the first racers were invited to come on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to such a request by launching the first luxury travel service in Britain for the current students.
To leave a clear impression of coming to university, the company also offers transport options such as a personal plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also stated that the service had thought about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their goods across the country into a dangerous overloaded car.
In conjunction with our new options for the VIF, we look forward to helping students this year to reach the university with a minimum effort and maximum shine.
The representative of the company reported that since the service had just started, orders had not yet been made, but added that “the students will start to order this service within a few weeks”.
The company also stated that despite the need for students to pay for the education of £9000 a year, it hoped to find a market for this service.
Students today are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hope: it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized this service as being deprived of reality.
Megan Dann, the vice-president of the NSS for higher education, said: “This project seems to be incredibly waste from the lives of most students.
Many students who will start a university this month face a life-value crisis when available financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet the rapidly increasing cost of basic needs before they can at all begin to think of raising thousands of pounds for some kind of simple arrival in the community.
Feminists raise the issue of racial affiliation and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed adolescent was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come raise their hands, screaming, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they're waiting in front of the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missuri, related to the murder of the unarmed adolescent Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Pérez noticed an Internet conversation among white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminists leaving comments put a gender above racial affiliation when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Middle West grew and national attention was drawn, Pérez saw the responses of white women, who concentrated 100 per cent on racial affiliation.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the murder of 9 August, personal essays with titles such as "the ideas of Ferguson from the white woman" and "Feminism is not only about the oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
But for Pérez, they showed a significant move.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis that we have faced, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so attached to racial affiliation, they felt that it should be pointed out.
For an English professor at the University of Ohio, Mitchell Ferguson discovered the problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural field.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and get 150 licks everywhere," Mitchell says.
When I write something about how colorful people are being attacked in their own country, silence is deaf.
"Why is it safe to talk to women about relationships, but not about public security?" she asks.
For black women, such as Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the U.S. history, there is no smoking between racial and gender issues.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly divide these problems; they face a difficult reality every day.
While white women are now combining racial and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hatter, professor of female and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors have done the opposite.
"There were at least 10,000 black men between 1865 and 1890, and this almost always resulted in the rape of a white woman," Hetter said.
There was a need for a white woman to confirm the story in order to justify leniency.
From the point of view of Hatter, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffrazants, such as Susan B. Anthony, examined the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for election law would be effective only for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in the box of the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for blacks should have appeared later," Hetter said.
Looking back at such things gives us a clear picture of why colourful women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women obtained voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching in the South Women ' s Association for the Prevention of lynching.
The group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
In the light of Mitchell's reaction to the problems of white feminists in Ferguson, police behaviour, racial discrimination, reflects the time when white feminists had to "fight" the problems of black women in several generations.
"Really, would it be great if activists with such [traditional feminist] ideology had the right to raise a child as they do with the right to contraception?" Mitchell asked.
The second wave fans who have made their careers in combating reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what this means.
A famous white feminist activist, Gloria Steinem, two weeks after Michael Brown's murder, took advantage of Facebook and published a brief article by the Guardian Rebecca Carroll columnist, who demanded that white Americans participate more in protests on racism.
"I hope that women who have another but similar reason to understand the danger inherent in the body - and the view of the racial problems that are fundamentally different from those of the public - will be in the head of change," Stein wrote.
Although Stanim is concerned about more interfering feminism, which includes racial issues and gender, her comments on race in America have still surprised some.
A researcher at the American Business Institute, Kristina Sommers, author of "Who stole feminism?" said She The People, that young men in the United States, especially the colorful young people, "are much more vulnerable than their sisters", but the comments of Stein on Ferguson contradict the criticism she had previously expressed.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, "Watch out for my brother", to help vulnerable black and Spanish young people, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
The relationship between the black community and the police is not the only problem that leads to a better line of traditional feminism.
After the US Border Service arrested some 63,000 minors without escorting to the south-west border this year, immigration reform again went on the surface - this time as a problem for women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to pose this problem as an important issue for women, it had to be shared only with the history of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the overwhelming majority of labour visas are issued to [immigrant men], women who come with them are placed in a position that is vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are a response to women's organizations," she said.
Ipswig House With Pigs for Sale
The photo of the house on sale in Suffolke was removed by real estate agents when it was shown that a large pig was present at the hotel.
The one-bedded house for sale is located on a private road in Ipswick.
A detailed description was made of a photo of the guest house, on which a pig with a head lying on the couch was depicted.
The real estate agency Connells reported that the pig in the photo is the pet owner of the house.
"In the same way, the photo has been incorrectly located and has already been removed," the representative told the company.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former house of the congregations as “a single house with one bedroom”.
Despite the fact that the agency has removed the photo from its website, it is still in advertising.
The sale of the house was of interest to social media, where some asked whether the pig was sold along with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the fourth round of the U.S. Open-up Caroline Voznaczki, believes she is not in a position to be stable.
According to the sportsman, she wishes to finish the year and try to go to a new level, transferred from New York to Vasilio OSIPOV.
How do you generally rate your results on the "More Helmet" tournament this year?
Of course, I'm glad you won the Rollan Harros.
As for the three other tournaments, I did not have enough stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
She couldn't even get to the fourth floor.
What are your goals until the end of the season?
After the trial, I have a huge incentive to move on to a new level.
I have a job to do, and I'm going to do my best to complete the year.
The Asian tournaments are starting in a few weeks.
A member of the Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former peace champion Nikolai Valuev, proposed that the WTO rules should be applied in the event of an entry into prison.
He said that the rules would generally be the same as in the Council time, that people would give the rules on withdrawal, escape and other exercises.
It is recalled that 12 Russian actors will begin to introduce WTO rules on their territory from 1 September.
I also suggested that schoolchildren who had given birth to the WTO should be given bonuses when they were in their arms, Valuev noted.
For example, they may be able to add some balls to the EEG.
There are also proposals to provide additional output workers to enterprises that have passed the sports tests.
A new millionaire appeared in the city of Harvey in South Wales after winning the lottery
A lottery game from Harvey this month.
A new millionaire is being searched for in the south-west of Perth, where one lucky man takes home nearly $1.1 million with a lottery match on Saturday night.
The newspaper kiosk in Harvi brings gold to the main prize second time in five years, last win is $1 million in November 2009.
A successful winner, however, still needs to make a statement about himself.
The owner of Steve Forvard's love, said you won, has caused a trip to a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everything is very excited.
We thought such a win could be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the winnings of the main prize last month, noting the completion of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, a game from Kenning Weil became one of five million August, following a huge $7.5 million win from Belmont just a few weeks before.
The winning couple has been playing for 20 years and reported that the winner has given them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.

Mini-economy wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce to the Government an integrated plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, told the director of the Department of Ministry Oleg Pluznikov around the table, which was held by the "Leadness" at the Moscow Autosalone in 2014.
The plan is made up of a Government mandate, one of the main objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September, at the beginning of October, says the Plügniks, the proposed measures relate to electric cars and hybrids, the plan for the development of gas fuel vehicles in Russia already exists.
The plan (there is a copy of the "Guidencies") is planned for 2014-2017.
The criteria for the assessment of electrical and hybrid transport are to be developed and how to promote the use and production of environmentally sound vehicles.
The report to the Government, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electricity transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the loan and loan scheme will appear by April 2015; and proposals for lowering the price of cars, encouraging localization and establishing a service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to amend the regulatory acts to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parks, car parks, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to make proposals for regional authorities during 2015 to also encourage the use of environmentally clean transport, in the form of enabling it to benefit from traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016, and proposals to increase the purchases of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will list the evaluation indicators of the activities of the regional authorities that reflect the effectiveness of support for the production of clean transport, the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric cars in Russia has not yet been established - around 100 electric cars have been sold throughout the country in 2013.
In early 2014, the import charge for electric cars was lifted and sales amounted to about 500 items, predicting the main executive director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankov.
However, the five-fold increase does not make the cars quite noticeable: in 2013 in Russia, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold.
While in Russia, only Mitsubishi Motors is imported.
The company is focusing primarily on corporate clients, says the Strategic Planning and Partnership Director of Renault in Russia, Nikola Remiz.
Most other electricity producers, however, have taken a waiting position with regard to Russia.
The development of electric cars is also in the hands of Russian producers, """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
For example, in January - July 2014, according to ASM-Haldinga, AutoWAZ released 30 electric cars.
The lack of demand for motor vehicles, the director of AutoWAZ for Sergey Amanov's engineering, will not be able to break through this segment....
The development of the Russian electric car market, in addition to the road cars (the cars sold in Russia, on average, two-way analogous to internal combustion engines) hinders the indevelopment of the charging infrastructure (the unit) and lifts the Director of Autostat Sergei Celikov.
Due to the expensive and low speeds of lowering the cost of the electric car in the next 3-4 years, the Russian market will remain a narrow segment, predicting the main editor "Authorev" Michael Travelianski, Celikov agrees with it.
On the contrary, car manufacturers say that some models of electric cars are already close to the value of conventional cars.
In the Russian electricity market, good prospects are being put in place, mainly to convince consumers that "electricity" is real; this will, in particular, contribute to the emergence of all new charging stations, emphasising the president of the BMW Group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented, for example, by Rossetti: several stations are being built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon appear.
Negotiations on the construction of a pipeline network are also under way with other regions.
According to the director of the Rossetei department Vladimir Sofia, the company believes in the electricity market and is ready to build facilities across the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and a lack of a single standard for charging different brands.
Moreover, Rosseti as a network company does not have the right to sell electricity, and it is designed to do so with regard to the charging of electric cars.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of the formation of the electricity market in Russia to be a tax on customs duties.
The zero rate will be available by the end of 2014, the possibility of extending it, the extension of the list.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and covered by all machines) will also support the market, but it is not as sensitive as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Transport tax in Russia is low, says Pankov, unlike Norway, where tax reduction has led to a sharp increase in the sale of electric cars, now accounts for 12 per cent of the market.
Russia needs and stimulates measures for drivers, such as free parking in the city centre (as already done in Moscow), assured Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric cars by designated sex, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado
The single-engine Piper PA-46 crashed in Colorado, U.S.A.
Three of the five people in it were killed, transferred to ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were delivered to the hospital.
Avarya took place several kilometres from Denver airport airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In the Danube area, there are armed combatants in the Donbass battalion.
The riders were surrounded by additionals.
They were handed over by their own commanders, and dozens of soldiers were shot.
Those who have survived say that if they knew what the situation in the south-east of Ukraine really was, they wouldn't go to war.
108 prisoners can be called happy.
The Donbass battalions remained alive after the "messorbuk" they fell under the Aviska.
In the area of the Danube People's Republic, the fighters spent a few days, actually disbanded by their commanders and authorities.
When it was reported from the headquarters that you could get out of the ring, the column moved.
But literally a few minutes from all sides, they hung their shells and bullets.
"The court has given me the information we had on the corridor, we've been allowed to leave, and the Deputy Battalion Commander with the Lermont call.
And when we got down to the bottom between multiples and redheads, there was a cross-fire with antitank-controlled missiles, with a "wheat", a 30-millimeter-millimeter grenade, a BMD automatic rifle, a small weapon.
Four cars went in front of me and behind three, and there were only two cars left.
An officer with the Lermont call tells us that at least 60 people were killed, dozens were wounded, many died after that.
The survivors are now providing medical assistance to those they have come to kill.
The prisoners are now surprised that so-called "terrorists" are dealing with them, giving them food, medicines.
While their own commanders actually lied to them and accused them of faithful death.
We've just been betrayed, they say.
A column, a battalion, to destroy it.
In the Donbass battalion, as did many of his companions, Alexei was a volunteer, because in Ukrainian news, they told about the atrocities that were allegedly committed in the south-east "separatists".
Alexei's already seen another picture here.
His mother in Lugansk was killed, not by anyone, but by Ukrainian soldiers.
My friend called me, told me that there was a minimony shot, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces, one of the soldiers, Alexei.
After that, I wanted to get out of the battalion.
We weren't released from Addisco, they said we were in the ring.
I've already agreed with the commander, and I've already written a report on care.
We've just been taken to Addiske with Zuracho's funerals.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were trapped in the "cat" under the Addisive.
Some survivors now recognize that if time could be returned, they would not enter the penal battalion for anything.
All the prisoners were handed over to the DNR force.
Everyone will be tested for involvement in war crimes.
In the region, there is a cost-restriction centre for products
In the country of Krasnoyarsk, a headquarters will be set up which, if necessary, will limit the increase in prices for products on the market in the region.
The order for the establishment of this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters was composed of members of the Government of the country, representatives of the executive authority and the supervisory authorities.
Together, they will monitor prices for agricultural production in the country.
Economy News ○ Will Kiev Rosnefti cost $140 million in losses?
Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, said that the company was appreciating damage to the shooting of the Lisican NPZ in Ukraine at $140 million.
That's what he reported in Spiegel's interview.
"We appreciate the damage of $140 million and will negotiate compensation negotiations with the Ukrainian Government," Secin said.
According to him, the implementation of the modernized company of Lisian NPZ was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no fighting, there were no "resurrection rebels," but the Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial site.
In addition, the technology oil that's stuck in the tube has disappeared," he said.
On 18 July, in connection with the attack by the Lisian NPZ, the oil storage tank was burned and the two warehouses were destroyed.
Lisican NPZ is the main oil-processing plant in Ukraine, firstly the company was built in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisian NPT is about 7 million tons of oil raw per year.
The plant is able to issue the Euro-4 fuel, as well as the Euro-5 fuel batch.
In March 2012, the supply of oil to Lisican NPZ was suspended due to its loss.
The company decided to start repairs.
Rosneft received the Lisian NPZ together with other Ukrainian TNC-WR assets a year later.
The DPRK has launched a small-scale project towards the Japanese Sea.
According to South Korean media, this occurred about 10:30 a.m. on the ground by the province of Chagando, which is on the North Korean and China border.
As told by Interfax in the Joint South Korean Headquarters Chiefs Committee, the missile probably crashed into the Japanese Sea after it had flown about 220 kilometres.
The rubble falls on the background of geopolitical pressure
In the Moscow Stock Exchange, the dollar grew to 3 copies up to 37.15 rubbing down to the biovoltaic corset in the face of geopolitical tension.
The exchange rate for the dollar for the ETS started with transactions at the borders of 37,11-37,2 rubs/$1, an average of two minutes of the rate recorded at 37,16 rubs/$1, that is 4 copies.
The Euro course was 48.79 rubbing for 1 euro, that's 3 cups.
The price of the bivalve mollusc added 3.5 copies and made up 42,395 rubles.
The U.S. dollar is traded at 23 copies. above the official course, the euro at 16 copies. above the official course.
The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but there was no panic this time.
He went on to be a hundred and a half years old, and he even updated the historical maxim to the dollar.
Investors are already experiencing a deterioration in the geopolitical environment and possible new sanctions to Russia.
However, it seems more like an artificial estuary, scattered through the media, especially the western ones.
The options for introducing new sanctions to the RF are not so much.
Teletrade "At the opening of the Moscow Stock Exchange, the ruble continues to be severely weakened against the biovolatile corset.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, both the Russian indices and the position of the national currency can be adjusted.
Orenburg Airlines will be tried with the "Ideal Tour"
The Orenburg Airlines presented an "ideal-tour" claim of a total amount of 4.7 billion rubles.
This is about two cases that will take place in October.
The case will be handled by different judges.
As Interfax reports, the first claim was filed on 14 August.
It's worth more than 425 million rubles.
The meeting was scheduled for 7 October.
The second statement was made on 18 August.
His sum is 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting was scheduled for 2 October.
As journalists in the Russian Union reported, judges in cases have been appointed different.
In July, the media reported an amount of 1.5 billion rubles on the “ideal-tour” debts in front of the “Orenburg Airlines”.
The Air Force Director, Victor Zukin, is talking about a sum of 1.6 billion rubles.
The head of the Aeroflot, Vitaly Saveliev, calls it another two billion rubles.
Twitter has tried to become more interesting for new users
The Twitter microblog service has changed the user registration process to involve new participants in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microbes.
Now, new Twitter users will be viewing a large number of recommended accounts during registration to form their reading circle immediately.
The recommendations are based on those identified in the registration of interests.
However, Twitter automatically sets the signature branch for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to manually shoot the cookies so that he does not read those who are not interested in him.
If microblog users have seen only the avatars of the recommended users before, Twitter will now close a sample of one of the popular tweets of a blogger to help make an impression on the person.
This is the biggest change in Twitter's foreign registration in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been active in modernising the service.
This activity is primarily linked to the ongoing efforts of the service to achieve safety.
In 2014, the microblog service experienced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a fall in reader activity.
The company is now desperately in need of more reliable consumer resources, which would last a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.
The day of knowledge in Moscow will be a dry and rainy day
The first September in the Moscow region would be cold and rainy throughout the day, meteorologists reported.
The air temperature in Moscow is between 16 and 18 degrees, in Podmoskova - 13-18 degrees.
When the weather is clear, there will be rain, and the wind of the eastern quarter will be quite weak, only 3-8 meters per second.
The car utility programme was renewed since 1 September.
With effect from 1 September, Russia is renewing the vehicle-utilization programme.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As Minpromtor's Head of the RF Denis Mantourov explained, money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the RF by redeployment from other areas of support.
The programme covers all cars over six years of age.
The amount of compensation shall be between 40,000 for the light car and 350 thousand rubles for the goods.
In Russia, such a vehicle-utilization programme had already been in place.
The main difference in the current project, explained by the Minister, is that not only is the use of machines to obtain a subsequent discount, but also the possibility, if the car is over six years old, to acquire a new one with a discount when the old one is placed in the "trade-in" to the dealer, is transmitted by the "Interfax".
Over 16 billion rubles have been lost in the previous federal tidal programme, which took place from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of light cars in 2010 was about 1.2 million (plus 101.4 per cent compared to 2009).
Creator Coming Out Simulator will issue a game about modern journalism
Gamemaker Nikki Casey, who was known for the Coming Out Simulator game, decided to play the game on modern journalism.
He told me about his project in Kill Screen interview.
Casey started work on the game a few weeks ago, but the fact has been widely known only now.
A source of inspiration for the game has become the events in Ferguson, where protests are now taking place after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be on how information about history has an impact on its impact.
Hero games, a civilian journalist, will need to photograph those in areas where police and population clashes occur.
Hero can take a different picture of what's going on, which affects what's going on.
If he shoots the scene so that the police will look like heroes, and the protesting gangs, the police will start to treat him better and let him go where he can't go.
If he's going to highlight events differently, his photographs can turn peaceful protests into a large rebellion.
The eyes of the game will have to be picked with a twitter, where new signatories will appear, if the photos presented there will be popular.
The game has not been named yet.
The date of exit and the platform on which it will appear are unknown.
Cases, however, published an image showing how the event could change depending on how the photograph was made and processed.
In an interview, Kill Screen Case explained that he had been considering the concept of such a game for a long time, but originally wanted to dedicate it to non-protests in the United States and to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting materials for the game, the game designer realized that he did not have enough knowledge and skills to highlight the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media highlighting the events in Ferguson, he decided to play the game on the grounds of what happened.
Nikki Casey is an independent developer who issues browser games.
His most famous project was the Coming Out Simulator, which came out in 2014.
This game, which tells about the events of Kees’ own life, is about how a bisexual teenager tries to tell his or her relationship with homophobic parents.
The Helmets Draw Ukraine into the Continuation of Blood
The call to prepare for the ordinary " tens of thousands" victims of the Defence Minister of Ukraine, Valerie Geletei, has led the people to continue the bloody resistance, says the Mid-Fi.
“In Moscow, of course, attention has been drawn to the statements made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valerie Gelete, who stated that “the completion of an operation to free the East of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of “The Great National War”, which would include “tens of thousands”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the Ukrainian military department, published on its page in Facebook, is the subject of a study of non-military professionals," the Russian diplomats reported.
They are hard to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On its page in Facebook, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “On informal channels, the Russian side has already threatened that in the event of continued resistance, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
He said, however, that the "operation on the liberation of the East of Ukraine" had been completed.
Through Hilton removed all the intimate photos of the stars and apologized
Today, more than 60 of the stars of Hollywood have been caught by the horrors.
Hackers broke primitive passwords in iCloud (data store) in smartphones, then their intimate photos appeared on the website of Perza Hilton.
True, not long ago.
The official star star Jennifer Lawrence has already reported stolen photos from her cell phone, and confirmed that all the photos that "sweet" in the Network are real.
Through Hilton, the creator of a single tabloid site, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues for publishing their photos, The Independent writes.
No, no one made me do that.
I wasn't contacted by their agents.
And now I'm gonna take a photo of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice," he wrote a blogger on Twitter.
However, all exposed photos of the stars have already flown over the Network.
David Beckham fell into the D.T.P. when he was hiding from the party.
David Beckham fell into a motorcycle D.T.P., saving himself from a pair.
This happened in Los Angeles on the way to the Boulevard Sanset.
The British footballer was separated by the error and dispersal of the muscles of his right hand.
Beckham got out of my dad's salon, where his parlors were waiting for him.
Since they were persecuted on motorcycles, he did not manage and fall, TMZ writes with reference to a close to the source footballer.
As a result, Beckham had a flaw, a right-hand muscle, and a carapine muscle.
Tony Stuart has an accident back on track.
Tony Stuart's return to the track ended a little more than in the middle of a race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stuart cut into the wall the second time after his front tire was broken down by 172 rounds, ending his speech.
Stuart took his car to the garage and then left without talking to the reporters.
His team leader, Chad Johnston, said that 14 members of the team were upset, but now focus on the race in the next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I would like to be a more successful attempt and a more successful finish for him," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hopefully we'll get better.
Stuart first cut into the wall earlier in the race on a resurrection night after meeting Kyle Bush, which required repair on his right side of the car.
"I started today with a pretty great hope to come to the finish," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded on the evac, and the team was gathered and ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during the ground track race in the north of New York.
He decided to return this week, and he had to win either at Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to participate in the prosecution.
He returned to work during a tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Youngest, who was on the road to express his discontent with Stuart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities announced on Friday that the investigation of the causes of the accident will continue for at least two more weeks.
A decision on whether to file an indictment was not taken by Stuart.
The three-time champion was met with loud applause and applause when he was presented before the race.
Starting with the 12th position, Stuart Shel in the first 10 at the start of the race, reaching the fourth position.
Then on 122 laps after the bus's restaurant number.
The car got 18 from the tractor on the way out of the turn 2 and cut into Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart continued, but remained until 21st position.
Sobtak and Vitorgan are eating cigarettes with Zwanecki in Odessa
Xenia Sobeck and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV conductor has not missed to report to his Instagram.
True, one photograph was very surprising, and the couple’s worshipers were greatly disturbed.
The photo was taken in Zwanecko.
"Tomorrow at Michael Michael Zvaneck's Maxim explains what the instagram is:)) #Odessa," she signed a photo of Xenia Sobeck.
However, there is nothing but cigarettes on the table.
No coffee, no scissors, no butter and nothing...
The worshipers of the couple decided that Xusha was smoking too, and they condemned her for that.
"And cigarettes whose?" "Cheer kills!" "Sometimes it's a cigarette morning," "I'd be like tomorrow, but only cigarettes on the table))) "" "Kenya, you're smoking too?"--were excited about your favorite signator of her blog.
Remember, the Nutchka recently enjoyed the first delicious meal that she had prepared for the first time in her life, Maxim Vitorgan.
"Happy is this when you come to the shower, and your husband has prepared dinner for your arrival (first for your wife's life, because it's delicious.
The picture shows that Maxim is making something with his heart, and the sun and the hot chicken are already on the table.
Bulgarian prison officials conducted a national protest
Hundreds of prisoners from all over Bulgaria have carried out a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to restore the old working conditions, which had recently been changed.
Increased salaries are also included in the list of requirements to be discussed with the Minister of Justice, Christo Ivanov.
During the month, the officers protested against a new schedule of work, requiring the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the union of prison officials met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice several times, the agreement was not reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BND) reported.
The negotiations continue, the Head of the Directorate-General for the Enforcement of the Sentences of Rosen Geljakov reported.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior will join in the protest of the union of prison officials.
The army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Praut (right) appointed Minister of Defence of the Rights of Wongsuvan (left)
The military governor and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praut Chan-Ocha, announced a new cabinet of ministers of the country, where more than three posts are held by generals or generals in resignation.
The military has received key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praut Chan-Ocha was approved as Prime Minister after the King of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the head of the temporary military Government.
The 60-year-old military who seized power in the country as a result of a bloodless coup on 22 May was the only candidate for the prime minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at the parliamentary meeting.
The army had previously appointed MPs.
According to Prauta Chan-Och, the reverse was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by the continuing half-years of demonstrations in which protesters demanded resignation from Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat.
Prutu Chan-Ocha will be officially a temporary prime minister, as the military is planning to hold a general election at the end of 2015.
However, there is fear that the military will try to strengthen its power in the country.
Soldiers arrived on 22 May
In the background of the full paralysis of the civil authority.
The leaders of the major political parties were under temporary arrest.
Immediately after the arrival of the military, they were arrested by the country ' s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yingluk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is rooted in 2006, when the army has resigned from the post of Prime Minister Yingluk Chinawat Taksin.
Both of them enjoy the popularity of the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has often made them successful in the elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the capital elite have entered the anti-government movement, which has practically paralyzed the country since November 2013.
Nobody said that the media room would be better, I didn't promise you that, the officer from the new Palm brewery was getting away.
It must be formally acknowledged that this is true, but the mind and the desire remain unexplained.
Because they've known long ago that we're saying "Belgium" -- mean the media, we're saying "media" -- meaning "Belgium."
Restaurants like to state in depth that the success of the institution depends on three factors: location, location and location.
There are places that are not so good, but even great, but some inconsistencies.
In a short time, when I was sitting behind Palm's chair, I remembered that there was once a coffee "The State" (in honor of the same TV broadcaster), then "Odesa-mama", and another restaurant "The God" and "The Friend".
Now here again is beer, but not nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Only the top of the iceberg was located above the ground: a bar stand and a pair of chairs, and the rest of the space is not even covered by the sunlight.
That's why it's fun here, like in a children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows, TVs, where girls and rubies swim.
The Belgian institutions in Petersburg have long been out of the news, so we can compare them to something.
Here are eight types of brewing beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 l) and a countless number of bottlenecks (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive official is happy to present the menu, saying that “medias are strong large seeds”, and it should be noted that, despite some shortcomings, service is the most positive side of Palm.
I am expected to be content, but often very unexpected to be fulfilled.
For example, someone has been warned that a meat roll with a walnut black (280 rubles) is actually a carpach, cut to the same size, so that the parchment paper compared to it is rendered indisputably thick.
It's possible to feel a taste, but it's only if you make a mistake together.
It's worse with salads.
The classic liege (260) would be best recognized as a crime against the Belgian people: some sleek iceberg, which was once opened a long time ago, a soaked Kenyan facade, squealed chips from the balcony, plus a seagull.
You don't want to meet anyone!
The ingredients of the Belgian salad were partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If there was still a blindfold for the missing quarter of the tomatoes or the overheated champions, why would the mediums look as if they had been able to freeze and open them several times for their lives!
I already know that there's quite a normal whitefish here!
They're placed in boxes "in sauce for your choice" (490-560 rubles per 0.5 kg).
The sousos of the pouch, the white wine, the celery, and the stamps, were not explicitly given.
There's fruit, and there's no aroma, whether there's wine or there's still a mystery.
That's why it's good to be in the middle of the free home with the Mayonese.
The chicken water here is not a pasta, so thick that depending on the mood you can solve, the first or second dish before you, and just a nice slipper.
It was stated that the rabbit was prepared in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
On the contrary, the situation was diametrically opposite: rosmarin blinded itself all.
It was impressive that this rabbit had been fed with only rosary pieces, from which the meat had acquired such an unusual aroma.
But the rabbit was attached to the knife - no, it was just an aperture in a caramelized leg.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also solid - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The clone sauce turned out to be too much hydrogen, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager at the table was very informally interested in the day - to - day impressions.
So you have to come back.
The dollar exchange rate rose to over 37 rubles on news of new sanctions against Russia in the West.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar was calculated "to-morrow" at 10:29 a.m. growth of 26.9 cups and was 37.02 rubles, the Euro course rose to 30 cups - up to 48.73 rubles, the Moscow Stock Exchange shows.
The variable corset grew by 28 copies to the previous closing level and stood at 42.28 rubles.
The dollar reached its peak on 19 February 2009 at which time it was 36.43 rubles, and on 3 March 2014, it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that the President of the United States, Barack Obama, and Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, were discussing the possibility of additional sanctions against Russia.
Weaknesses are long-term, in pairs with the euro, and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast meant this note, says the senior analyst, "Alpari" Anna Bodrov.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected in courses anyway.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
Today's hearings about the invasion of the troops have not been confirmed on either side, but the market has become very emotional.
All the talks that he had held on to such news were overrun yesterday.
A week is estimated to be around 36,90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period has ended, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, gas transit through Ukraine, all of which are a single chain.
The inflation gap is also forecast: the current price for autumn will be increased from 5 to 10 per cent.
In the meantime, seasonal plants and fruits will be completed, and some vacuum will occur while the networks are refocused on other suppliers.
"The dollar came to the mark in 37 rubles, passed it and returned, there was no powerful exodus," commented the head of the market analysis "Open Broker" Constantin Bushuev.
They will still see if they will introduce the promised sanctions on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
Rubl said that after the end of the tax season, the news went on in Ukraine, and the CB said last week that by the end of the year it had gone completely to the floating course and had refused any monetary interventions.
If you look at day-to-day fluctuations, it was nothing different from the previous month, everyone was afraid to note in 37 rubles, the analyst continues.
Well, there's nothing powerful about it.
The critical times for the currency market were recalled when an increased demand for the currency was observed at the end of January, as well as the third March, when the CB downloaded a record of the currency.
In UFS IC also see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, it is an increase in the income of the export budget, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers through import travel, says UFS chief analyst IC Alexei Kozlov.
The travel of imported goods and services can be carried to a negative point.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency have significantly reduced the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, caused inflationary pressures to increase, and consequently have become the cause of the money-laundering, which in turn would hamper the development of the country's economy.
When it comes to the stock market, the underestimation of the rubles is somewhat less than the price of the shares expressed in the rubles.
For example, the IMF index in the quarter trade decreased by 1.67% and the RTS index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative reduction of indexes is due to a decrease of less than 1.5 per cent during the day.
The weakening of the rubble is emotional and is due to a massive desire to buy the currency.
As the practice has shown, the emotions are gradually gone, and the scoreboards are partially or completely restored to lost positions.
"We believe we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency close to 36 rubles per dollar," notes Alexie Koslov.
Genetic violation is often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she had spent many years thinking she would die after a misdiagnosed diagnosis.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she remained living for a few years after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, it had a scarco-Mari-Tut (SMT) disease, a group of hereditary disorders that caused nerve damage outside the brain and the spinal cord.
The charity of CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis was a common problem among people with CMT because it was so little known about this condition.
Approximately 23,000 people in Britain are likely to have SMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, unbelievably walking, and raised legs.
Patients may experience inflammation or pain, and the condition is not healed and progresses, which means that symptoms are increasing over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought that she was suffering from the attack of Friedrich (AF) - a condition that was very poor.
Rogers thought she'd be attached to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and she'd die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "With riben, I knew I couldn't do what others could.
I fell off every day, and I had more time to spend.
I've never been able to get into roles or skateboards with other kids, and I've had a lot of fun at school because of how I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations, to free her head and lift her feet, she looked into the medical card when her doctor left the room, and it was written that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I had a nose that wasn't right, and that's why I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this situation in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received the information in reply, I was shocked and tried the most horrible panic as soon as possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair in 18 and I'd die before I turned 25, and I'd lose all my abilities in this middle.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funerals.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd already been in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that represents a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic studies, she found SMT.
"When he explained that it was a SMT, I thought I pulled out a happy ticket," she said.
The blessed organization of the United Kingdom SMT announced a month of information on the SMT in order to try to draw attention to this disease.
Tax burden on businesses in the Washington area is rising as the economy recovers
The restored economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
The state and local tax accounts for companies across the country increased steadily last year when the economy was restored, according to a new study published last week, and the Washington area was not an exception.
The companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia paid together $27.6 billion in the state and at the local level in the financial year 2013, with 3.8 per cent higher than the $22.6 billion collected for 2012.
The tax burden on businesses by state and local level increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent earlier, and this was the third half-year of growth after the next year, when the accounts decreased, in 2009 and 2010.
The taxes levied by the state increased faster, 4.3 per cent than the local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to a study carried out by a professional service firm, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, a tax policy group.
More than half of the income in the district, 56 per cent, is taxed on entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Maryland's income is taxed on companies.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, has the lowest tax income, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, tax revenue increased by return on the value of the company's real estate, researchers said that the real estate tax increased by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years, when the increase was less than 1 per cent.
While the majority of these revenues are large, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same is happening in the Washington area.
The companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia paid together $10 billion in real estate taxes at the state and local level last year, at $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate did not have a similar effect on the increase in State and local income in Maryland, where real estate taxes were barely more than one fifth of the company ' s tax accounts.
The companies in Virginia and the District of Colombia pay about half of the taxes on the state and at the local level in the form of real estate taxes.
"What is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Colombia, belongs either to the Government or to a non-profit organization that does not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay the same services in other states.
The recent increase in corporate tax income cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
Entrepreneur's income also appears to be changing according to this data.
Companies in the region have declared a corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion, for $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has collected $1 billion of corporate income from income tax, most in the region.
While trends are directed in one direction, corporate tax burdens at the local level are not increasing at the same rate in all three locations.
The rate of growth in the Colombian District was at the same level as the average country, 4.3 per cent, while the rate of growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
Only in Virginia was tax income below the average, equal to 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each of which was the same corporate rate) was 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the district it is relatively high at 9,975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia, taxes are lower for state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favourable climate with regard to corporate taxes than in Maryland.
The district was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantages, Virginia is experiencing competitive pressure from its southern neighbour.
North Carolina has recently signed a legislative act reducing the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continues to achieve tax income targets next year, this law could lead to an income tax rate for entrepreneurs up to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington area seems to feel better and thus pays more taxes at the state and local level, according to a recent study.
Tax for entrepreneurs paid in the form of an individual income tax by small business owners is a transitional structure whereby the majority of small companies in the District of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia have increased by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher rate of growth than for entrepreneurs in general.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in income from business taxes across the country are likely to continue this year when incomes from government and local incomes increased by 6.2 per cent for the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may be left because the decrease in federal spending affects the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The Grand Duchy World Cup brought two silver and seven bronze awards to Russia.
According to this indicator, the Russians have only become the main favorite of the Japanese collective competitions.
The tournament in Chelabina started on Monday, and the first day of the day brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who spoke in the category up to 60 kg.
However, in the same final fight against Baldbaator Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the opposition was only one comment received by the Russians.
And that's the second day of the tournament was the most successful for Russia's gathering - on Tuesday, three medals were won immediately.
In men's competitions of up to 66 kg of silver, Michael Pulaev was won, and the bronze was Kamal Han-Magomedov.
In the final one, the Russians won the 2011 and 2013 World Cup of Japanese Massai Abinum.
Han Magomedov, at the fourth final stage of the winning race, won a comforting tournament and became the owner of the bronze prize.
In the women's tournament, up to 52 kg, up to the third grade, Natalya Kusuvina was the first to arrive.
In the semifinal, she lost the current peace champion, Milinda Kelmandi, from Kosovo, who was the champion under the flag of the International Federation of Jews and successfully defended the title.
In the fight for the bronze Kusuvina won Ma Yanan from China, but after the tournament ended, it was admitted that third place was not exactly what she was counting on.
And once again, the Russians have become a gold miner at the end of the European championship, Kelmandi, who conquered Kusuutina.
On the third day, Musa Moguškov, a team of up to 73 kg, placed a tournament in the Chelibne Bronze in a collection of Russians.
In the fourth quarter, he was the former representative of Moldova, Victor Skowartz, now a member of the OAU team.
However, the Russian won two awards and became the winner of the prize.
Mojushkov was at the home champion with a big-ass trauma he was planning to treat in the near future, so he would take a break at the competitions.
As for ex-Moldovan Square, he and he reached the bronze medal on the tournament.
Interestingly, his other associate, who had adopted OAU's sporting nationality, Ivan Remarenko had completed his presentation in the bronze category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of CM-2014 also brought a bronze to the Russians, which, in the category up to 81 kg, won Ivan Nifont.
In a severe defeat, he won the Frenchman Alan Schmitt by commenting on the opponent.
On Friday, three prize sets were played on the tournament, but the Russians by tradition were limited by one bronze in the male tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Cyril Questionos, and the medal was guaranteed by the gathering of Russia: his rival at the comforting final was the associate of Cyril Denisov.
However, there was no understanding of it: the opponent of the Question was unable to leave on Dads because of the trauma.
The male bronze was won by the owners and on the sixth day of the contest, she was put in a collection piece by Renat Saidov, who spoke in a category of over 100 kg.
In the comforting finale, he won a clear victory over the Brazilian David Moore.
Thus, the individual part of the world’s preeminent has ended.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelabinsk, on Sunday, the world championships were playing in command contests.
Both the Russian and the male, and the female, were one of the main candidates for prizes, but, as in individual competitions, the representatives of the fine sex did not succeed - they did not succeed until the medal.
And here are the Russian Jews who won the command silver.
In the decisive opposition, they have replaced the Japan team with the main supporters of the 2-3 account.
The Russian assembly said 2-0 after Han Magomedov's and Willow's victory, Denis Yarzev (Wess to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories with their Japanese opponents, Murat Habatirov (81), Magomed Magomed (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope.
The script also developed a bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian assembly, led by 2-0, joined the Japanese - 2-3.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, was present at the team meetings in Chelabin, which, after the tournament, welcomed the male assembly with the silver.
"The second place is very early, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could become champions," said Putin, whose word is called the RIA News.
To play Japanese, to the grandparents, there's nothing strange about it.
But I'm sure you can win them.
The Russian Assembly at the World's Home Championship was much better than a year ago at a similar level held in Rio de Janeiro.
Then there were only three medals in the Russian team, one silver and two bronzes.
Meanwhile, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstian and Mansur Isaev.
We're all, of course, big maximists.
Yeah, he wants gold medals.
But let's remember, if a person in the Olympics is in the eighth most powerful, he's a potential winner of the Olympics.
The more sport like Judo," said RF Sports Minister Vitalie Mutko, whose speech is the champion's press.
The Japanese assembly was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various honors, five of which proved to be gold.
The next World Championship will take place in Astana next summer.

The Joan Rivers family is looking forward to the best
Joan Rivers was unconscious about coming to the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter hoped today that the 81-year-old comedian would recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in her statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai on Thursday after an emergency call that she had had a heart attack at a hospital in Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscope.
Doctors intend to keep her under drugs and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “hard”.
The response was widespread, including numerous Internet support from such as Donald Tramp, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
All the Kings Can Do It
In sale, the debut album of the Royal Blood Group is a new British year's hope that the rock-duet will be released from the clubs at the stadium.
Duet Royal Blood has been on stage all year, but it's already actively nominated for the BBC Music Award, the Arctic Monkeys War Tour, and a New York concert guest from Jimmy Paige himself.
Their debut single album was received in a few months before the release of 100,000 pre-orders, and the contract for its release is in the Major Label Warner Music portfolio.
In view of the current weeping situation in the music market, the situation is emerging from a number of vans, because it is not about the new Lane Del Ray or the regular sweet-sweeter representative of the "New R'n'B" and about the dutes of the British-types playing with that level of gravity and intensity, which was the last time in a couple of decades ago.
Overall, the first album rates for all the above-mentioned circumstances have been particularly high and have already been fully justified.
Duet was not blind to the name that he had been able to reach before, but that the desperate hairdressers were already, and the blood of the kings was running, as they think, in their lives, as well as understanding.
The point is, of course, above all, about the heroes of the last level Led Zeppelin: like a large quarter, Royal Blood is intended to raise the blood of the British year, bringing it to a new height.
To make predictions about the company's success so far, please, it's hurt, but something can be said.
The ten songs that have been recorded in thirty minutes and a few minutes are not so much a demonstration of the phenomenal compositional gift as a sure and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the honours of the individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: let's say, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by what is remembered, not by a melodic line, but by a drum party.
The musicians in the joke say that it's easier to knock than to drink.
It is also worth assigning the powerful Little Monster and closing the plastic "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeareic quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at the party of heavy year lovers, but when they are played, they are merged into a more or less uniform canvas.
And that's not necessarily bad, even the opposite.
The Royal Blood force is that they don't claim to be the laurel of the new Lennon and McCartney (they're already in Motörhead's successor), but they've got a lot of rock duets out of the ghetto Indian clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, was created for stadiums, in a room with fewer than a few thousand people, it was obviously close.
The secret is partly in the clever use of the bass that replaced the guitar in the usual format that was thought of at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
However, the case is not only in the instruments but also in the approach of making songs.
Heroes of the zeros with a lot of work were selected beyond the postmodernist paradigm, with a huge dismay to recognize themselves not just as epigons but as independent creative units.
But the Royal Blood is already sounding so powerful and sharp that this effort succeeds in grasping some secondaryity and stubbornness of the musical material.
Well, at the end of the day, who said that rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what he reported on Friday morning: Online Store and Video Producer, and a hundred other things, bought a Twitch stream service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news turned out to be a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch video service to Google for a good billion looked completely ready, and that combination seemed natural.
Twitch, based only three years ago on Justin.tv, aimed at being a common service, a real-time YouTube version.
Instead, he quickly became a platform where the gamers broadcast their internal moments; "YouTube for real time," says Business Insider.
Interface Twitch.
And let's play, a genre of videoists who know how to give (mainly, old) the treatment games, like in the "Tainn Theatre", are already popular on YouTube.
The thing is that YouTube is often mentioned when they describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met without special interest, a classic example of a sophisticated technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a secret why the YouTube deal failed, given that, according to the information available, he was willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from Executive Director Twitch Emmett Shira: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who say they're better at sports than watching it, it's hard to understand how attractive it is to watch games instead of taking a jostic hand.
One thing is to look through each other's shoulders at 3:00 a.m. when she walks through Resident Evil, and the other thing is to look at how some other person gets 20 shots in the head at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are calculated for one person, so to look at their collection without controlling the angle of view alone can be a recipe for the main pain that is worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the fast-tracking events where the Rogers of our electronic age are ending all the games in record time are entertaining.
But if it's not a virtual game or humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel would be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics know about me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and this is the fourth source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon work on this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will turn to Amazon Instant Video as perfectly as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has what any company would be pleased to get: a crowd of young men who are dreaming about.
As head of Twitch Shir, Amazon and Twitch said "both believe in the future game", and this channel does not give evidence of belief, even - oh - as a visual sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed as a result of the 2004 terrorist attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talking to survivors -- almost all the time -- with the parents of the deceased -- with the supervisor of the Garden of Angelov -- Ramon Kaspolatov, head of the Mother Beslan Committee of Susan Dudiev, who participated in the specialization of the PMS staff -- tells the correspondent of Elizabeth Antonov's Society, working on the special project.
As soon as they returned to Moscow, they met with Assalahanov, who had been the president's adviser to the North Caucasus 10 years ago and had talks with terrorists, as well as with the government officer "B" of the Russian Federation, Vajeslav Bocharov."
What struck me especially during the work on this subject is that there were no ten years in Beslan.
This subject is extremely painful for everyone who has a bearing on it, and people are hard to agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very difficult.
But you can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job," Antonova said.
A special project has been prepared by a study of Dutch Infographics Rambler & Co, which has been working in companies since spring this year.
Previous special projects were devoted to World War I and to the 15-year stay of Vladimir Putin in power.
The DPRK has launched a small-scale missile
North Korea launched a small-range rocket in the Japanese Sea, reports Renhap.
The launch was conducted about 10.30 a.m. on a local time basis by the province of Chagando, on the North Korean and China border.
It is likely that the missile fell into the Japanese Sea, about 220 km in the spring, and the Joint Committee of South Korean Chiefs declared it.
Members suggested speeding up the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative was successful, Russian data could not be stored on servers abroad since 1 January 2015
The draft law was introduced in the House, which provides for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Russian Personal Data Act from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative activities of the Lower House.
Its authors were Mr. Wadim Dengin, Mr. Jaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov (“One Russia”), Mr. Vladimir Parachin (“Just Russia”) and Mr. Alexander Yuštenko (CPRF).
This change will, in the opinion of the sponsors of the initiative, contribute more quickly and effectively to ensuring the rights of RF citizens to the preservation of personal data and to the confidentiality of correspondence on information and telecommunications networks.
The Act, which requires Parliamentarians to enter into force, requires that Russian personal data processed via the Internet be stored in the territory of the RF.
It also makes mandatory records, systematization, storage, storage, clarification and extraction of RF citizens' personal data in Russian-based databases, as well as information on the location of such databases.
In addition, the law grants Roscondour the right, on the basis of the court's decision, to restrict access to information processed in violation of RF law in the field of personal data.
The Act also proposes the establishment of so-called "black lists" of the "infringing sites" - an automated information system "List of personal data subjects " .
This law was adopted by the Lord of the summer.
The authors of the bill made statements by Andrei Lugov and Wadim Dengin from LDPR and Alexander Yuštenko from CRC.
Dengin and Yuštenko are also one of the authors of the current draft law on the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Those who don't have RF dates will have to pay for the rent.
Commenting on the draft bill of the first opinion of the Information Policy Committee, Leonid Levin said that he did not see any problem in transferring the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to him, companies that do not have their own Russian personal data storage in the territory of the RF by 1 January 2015 will be able to rent them, for example, in Rostelekoma, which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers in the rental and that they already provide their servers, in the Mail Group, to Western companies that are already providing their servers.
"There are also several independent data centres ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies decide to enforce the law and continue to work in the territory of the RF, I don't see any problems - they will get technological opportunities for placement," Levin said.
Proportional bill
As soon as the draft law was published, the Russian Electronic Communications Association feared that many global Internet services would no longer be able to use Russia's draft law.
In particular, this is about online air and air navigation services.
According to the association, “the bill derogates from the personal data subjects - citizens of the Russian Federation's right to have their own data dealt with imperatively by determining that their record, systematization, etc. should be provided only in the databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement stresses that the establishment of a user information mechanism on the location of the record would be more effective.
In such a case, you will be able to choose the territory in which these actions will take place.
The adoption of the same "localization" personal data laws in other countries has led to the neglect of global services and significant economic losses.
The cold water test was carried out by the driver
Isabel Roberts, from Britain, shouted so much when her head was poured out with cold water that damaged the bone structure of her face.
This cold water test didn't hurt that way.
The woman was hospitalized after she cried so much during the cold water test, which lifted her jaw.
Isabel Roberts shouted so furiously when her head was poured out with cold water that it damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I yelled, but when I did, my jaw began to cry," she said The Mirror.
Water's on the 20th.
Isabel Roberts in seconds to an accident
I tried to close my mouth, but he didn't close, he locked up, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister came up with the same idea and they began to want, but I had to drive immediately to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old woman from the United Kingdom was taken to the hospital to get her head up after participating in a popular involvement on Tuesday.
The clip has become an Internet sensation and has been published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The police transferred more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
In the Novorossia Army, they claim that the Ukrainian Su-27 was defeated and accused of violating the ceasefire agreement.
At 10 a.m. on 1 September, the police transferred 402 prisoners to Ukraine, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported by the press representative of the Novorossia Army.
He added that “by force of WFP in the Meresca area, the Su-27 aircraft would crash in violation of the ceasefire agreement”.
According to the interviewer of the agency, the Ukrainian side of the artillery shooting at the Lugan airport has applied cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions.
The representative of the press noted that at night the policemen were able to damage two Ukrainian HVV helicopters on one of the field airports, as well as to destroy two bronze carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
"The victims of the enemy's life force -- up to a hundred people killed and wounded -- have been captured by 13 people," said the representative of the headquarters.
The interface does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the “national republics” of Donbass stated that the Ukrainian side had been transferred under the ceasefire regime of 223 prisoners of war and soldiers of the Ukrainian National Guard.
At the same time, at night, the DND army, according to the Army of Novorossia, "has crossed the attempt of the enemy in violation of previous agreements to get out of the district of the district of gravity."
Then the police reported the destruction of two tanks in a short battle and two BMPs, captured six tanks and 198 military personnel.
According to the headquarters, the total enemy losses in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariúpolis) that night were five tanks, eight armoured cars, more than 120 killed and wounded
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers were surrounded by policemen in the Apisk area in the Danube region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the "national republics" to expel Ukrainian soldiers from the environment.
In the DND, they agreed to do so, provided that the opponent was handed over weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of military personnel began leaving the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defense battalion Donbass Semen Zemenchenko, 14 more people left the cat on Sunday night.
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded were "in prison with 137 poles of 32 RF Divisions and 9 RF Tank Brigades", where they dealt well with them.
Meanwhile, the Russian Ministry of Justice and Defence rejected reports by Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
MID RF: Russia will respond to the introduction of new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take response measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-dumping sanctions, reports the IMF.
The Russian Foreign Diplomatic Authority's communication states that the European Council ' s conclusions of 30 August have demonstrated the inability of EU member countries to overcome the inefficiency of their impartial support by the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia participates in the situation in the east of Ukraine, based on “absolutely unmistakable allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of the country”, the Department said.
The IMF regrets that, in spite of the interests of its Member States, Eurostat is being influenced by countries that are interested in strengthening confrontation with Russia.
Members of the Eurosavet should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine, as well as for conditions for a full “dialogue between the opposing parties”, the Department stressed.
The Committee also notes that there is now no objective assessment of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has occurred, as well as the number of victims among the peaceful population.
Let us recall that the European Union is planning to develop specific proposals for sanctions against the RF during the next seven months.
In this way, EU representatives work closely with US officials.
It is expected that they will correlate the measures introduced during the period of action and the degree of severity.
The new sanctions of the Euro Union can be directed towards energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in the field of defence, finance and oil-gas industry.
Smart ways to save on university textbooks
While the value of university textbooks for many students is over $1,00 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move on to the second course, thought of a clever way to reduce costs.
He has developed a system of taking books to the elders, offering them nominal compensation to delay their sale.
"My mathematical analysis textbook, which usually costs $180, I received at the $10 semester and the Chick-fil-A oven," says Schroeder, 19, who is taught at the College Convention in Georgia.
The required literature last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the Board of Colleges, the average student spends more than $1200 a year on textbooks and training, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online shops and creative ideas like the Schroeder system.
The books are becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often it is much cheaper than their purchases.
Nibo Incorporate, which has more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of books has grown twice since 2011.
The industry's studies show that about four books in university bookstores were taken out during the last spring semester, says Vice President Nibo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the professional association “National Association of University Stores”.
Here's an introduction course in the best ways to make a good deal.
Buy online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price for a new book can be one third of what you see in the university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematic Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hosteler is about $290 per pre-currant, but a new copy can be obtained for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of the detainee
If you're not against foreign marks or injuries, supported textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematic Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in a supported form at Chegg.com.
Matt Cassedy, a 25-year-old fourth-year-old student at the University of Brigem Yang, says he paid 42 cents at Amazon.com for a supported copy of the "Strategic Solutions in the Media: Understanding of the Business side of Advertising".
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Braci, director of the College without Wall at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, offer students to clarify their professors whether previous publications can be used.
At times, updates are not essential for the exercise.
In such cases, old editions can often be found to be very little of the value of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com sites, owned by eBay Inc., are a popular alternative to buying supported books.
Prokat
In order to take the books off, you have to think if you are good enough to deal with them, do not forget to return them and do not want to leave them after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to take the "Mathematic Analysis" for a semester of about $20.
Explain the rules of the store where you take books, including any fines that you can write for notes, accents and injuries.
If you take a book on your own, remember: if you don't return a book, fines can even exceed the value of a new copy.
E-Books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually taken for granted by obtaining an electronic license for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematic Analysis" project on Chegg.com for six months is worth approximately $61.
Braci says that students studying literature can often find the most beneficial prices, since many classics can now jump free of charge, while literature on natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look.
Joe Golt, 29 years old, who is going to start law school in Pepperdin, recommends using the ISBN number to figure out the book prices, as it guarantees that you are looking for the text you need.
Before ordering the Internet, Holt says, you must check if the book is in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he had acquired was delayed for four weeks, and at the end of the day, he paid the full price in the university bookstore.
Putin stated that the development fund in the Far East had been ineffective.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, announced at the meeting on the ownership of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East, that the long-east budgetary investment fund, established two years ago, was ineffective, reported by the Interfax.
"15 billion rubles remained on deposits," the president stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested that the list of developing territories in the Far East be accelerated.
He recalled that the draft law needed to be introduced to the House in the autumn.
The Federal Assembly, noted the President, until 1 July, did not adopt the list of developing territories in the Far East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also set out key challenges for the development of the Far East.
Among them, increased transport availability in the region, the removal of infrastructure constraints - both in the internal market and for export development.
In addition, there was a need to create a prerequisite for attracting additional investment in the region, as well as to form an emerging development area that should become competitive with the key business centres of the ATR, the President stressed.
It was previously reported that the developing territory could replace the OECD.

"Non-contained 3" Sylvester Stalin returned less than $30 million from his $90 million budget to the United States, while "The City of Sins: The woman for whom he was to be killed" only returned $12 million from his $70 million budget.
The "Home Video" with Cameron Diaz brought only $14.6 million to the first outputs, while children's movies, such as "How to Hand Dragon 2" are also disappointed by the output.
A film critic's article by Telegraph Robbie Collina suggests that when it comes to children's films, it may be a case of bad film quality.
Collin called 2014 "the worst" year in all history with regard to children's films, and called "How to assign dragon 2" a "functioning" fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at audiences a little older, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the same as films.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film that came out in the summer in the amount of 2000 copies between the Memorial Day in May and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account both filmmakers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film crop is similar to the previous year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that the case may be in changing viewing habits and growing popularity of Internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favro, who is currently working on the fast-tracked disco film "The Jungle Book" said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think the times are changing."
We must admit it and not try to get angry for what was before.
In contrast to the current decline in cash collection in Hollywood, Netflix's income from the flow of production service reached $1.2 billion, almost twice as high as the previous year's figure in $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spillberg criticised the studios for being too dependable on comics, and predicted the "scrams" of Hollywood.
In light of the current decline, some commentators claim that his dark predictions were part of the truth.
Because a number of potential cash hits are expected in 2015, including "Eri Altrons", "Minionovs" and "Uur Park", other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
The producer "People X" Simon Kinberg recently called the fall of cash collection just "cyclic," said Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the most cash summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Product sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with caucasian and medieval food, but for restaurants in the European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
In general, it is still preferable to replace prohibited imports of products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There is more salty heat than a bad mozarel," says Italian restaurant chief Barlotti Mariano Valerio about the quality of cheeses offered to him by suppliers in exchange for Italians.
Mozarella and the cheese burata are finished in the restaurant first, they have a little storage time.
The stockpiles shall be sufficient for a few months.
What to do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005, I was on the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio is making such an eye, which is clear: shocking memories do not leave him so far.
The meat was only about 20 inches [30 cm] in length!
There's balls in there!
Chris!
Then I said that for our restaurant we would never buy anything in Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe now everything's changed.
But on days, I got a sample of fish from the Far East.
That's how she got tired!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought this to us.
Valerio is surprised that many things are common to Italy for the Russian producer in the wild.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, the meat in the refrigerator is suspended for 10 days at 1-2 degrees.
It has to hang to make the muscles soft.
I've done all this with a local beef.
Then I was asked, "Where did you get that soft meat?
I said, "That's yours, Russian!"
Why don't you guys do that?
In five minutes' walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant Brasserie Bridge, the kitchen hangs a list of non-precious products: French oysters, seafood.
The head of the Brasserie Bridge restaurant and the Arrow Bar Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: the French strips have already replaced the strips from Tunisia, and instead of the French cheeses the restaurant will buy Swiss.
On the other hand, Regis is becoming more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "The flower cap is 200 rubles!
I'm asking, "Why is she so much worth?"
They say, "We have to earn too."
But this coat should not be worth 80 rubles!
We're buying the East Sides by weight, but they're 15-20 years old, you know how heavy their pancakes are?
The price is that it's superdelicate.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of fearsome foreign landmines.
The standard story: "The first three months were all good, then the quality fell sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot maintain stable calibration and quality.
Many restaurants in the European kitchen do not know what will happen to them when the cheese stocks are over.

Penalties menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are called primarily product sanctions.
The import of beef, pig, meat and offal from poultry, meat delicacy, fish, molluscs, milk, yoghurts, cheese, cheese, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups is prohibited in the country.
Restaurants have started a bar with suppliers: prices for products have grown, like other countries need to be urgently sought.
The most powerful thing that will be said is the expensive restaurants from the French, Italian, Spanish, where products were placed directly from the "maternal" countries.
The funeral was to be held early.
For example, in early 2014, Rosselhozhnadzor banned imports of Australian beef and a year earlier, American and Canadian meat.
In exchange, suppliers set up supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But summer-2014 sanctions were much more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which would rule out the prohibition of Atlantic salmon and furloughs, unsweetened milk, seed potatoes, sugar maize, mountains and garlic for sowing.
Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can still be softened.
As long as some restaurants are in uncertainty.
According to the East-West company, one of HoReCa's largest suppliers, the import share in the premium segment was up to 70 per cent.
"Dorgo restaurants will have to change the menu under what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergey Mironov, restaurant owner of the Restkonsalt Agency.
If the boss is strong, he won't have a problem.
We only have very little of this, and a new menu can be developed for two or three months.
The Trigel from the Brasserie Bridge restaurant is ready for this: to refuse from 10-15% of cattle, another half of the menu is to be processed.
In restaurants with mixed kitchens, there is already a substitute for a candle, such as a marble beef stick, says Sergei Mironov.
"The cheeses from Europe can be replaced by the Russian, Belarusian raw materials, the raw materials from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile, and the representatives of the East-West company, Oxana Glibchuk.
The stocks and milk products from Europe are similar in Russia and Belarus.
A U.S. chicken can be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, a salmon and a seven from Norway, a salmon, a seven from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of fruit and vegetables from European production can be offset by the production of domestic producers, proposed by Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironova, the budget grid restaurants will be rebuilt simply than the premium segment: there were hardly any gourmets that could distinguish the Italian mozarel from the Russian.
Although it is difficult for the Ginza Project institutions, he believes it.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with its menus.
There will be a time for replacement," Mironov says.
In Ginza, the comments were rejected, referring to the lack of landowners.
The coffee owners of the Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine stress that products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than European.
But there are also many restaurants whose sanctions are practically out of reach.
These include establishments from the kitchens of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in the Georgian kitchen," says Hatuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and coffee "Wy me!"
All cheeses are made for us in Russia, based on a lot of cows, a chicken file, and we don't use exotic vegetables."
In the Colbai institutions, they have not yet removed any candles from the menu.
Timura Lanski, the owner of Chihon N1 restaurants from the Uzbek kitchen, is also not disturbed by the sanctions: he will only have to change his lamb in New Zealand.
If Russia is to import from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win the price, it will be cheaper for us than for imports from Europe, he says.
You can get a cut, a lamb, a tomatoes, an oats, a fruit.
While they're bringing in from Central Asia, it's much better than plastics from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
The Uzbek tomatoes all know they're delicious, sweet.
No one's talking about Spanish.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of Uzbekistan Olymbai Artikov said that he planned to increase exports of fruit products to Russia by two by 2016.
Of its intention to replace European imports into Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions, Belarus and Kazakhstan stated.
The restaurants that responded to Deneg's request also respond fairly quietly to the sanctions.
McDonald's Press said that the location is over 85% and the network is working with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanov, the head of the Department of Subway Russia, about 80 per cent of the network purchases in Russia, although temporary difficulties may arise with the supply of fruit and rising prices for meat products produced from imported raw materials.
The term "licensing products" was generally not more than 4 per cent.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the Wocker pen.
KFC, Burger King and "Kroška Cartoška" did not respond to Deneg's request, but other market participants claim that the location of Burger King is significantly less than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are ready to buy more Chilean than Russian remote-east
In his pride.
While restaurants complain that the demand for price increases even for local products.
"Grabley's products have increased by 10-15% on average, and Cherry Mio's Italian restaurant is twice," says restaurant Roman Rožnikski.
Even in Georgian restaurants, self-esteem rates are rising by 5-10 per cent, and Colombia recognizes.
The West West does not deny this: "For example, the Belarusian milk production from the beginning of August was 10-15%".
"The Brazilian suppliers have raised prices for pigs almost twice, regrettably Sergey Rack, Deputy Director General Stardogs.
About 35 per cent of the chickens traveled.
We're looking for a price from China, maybe they're gonna stay hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, the Stardogs will have a projected 8 per cent increase in prices.
Now, it's so bad to raise prices, Rack says.
According to statistics, the increase in demand for second quarter 2014 was only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest post-2010 rate.
The different prices will grow further, he recognizes, but it is not clear how fast: while most restaurants have been saved by products for the next two months in the hope of shifts in purchase prices.
But what's going to happen two months later, nobody knows.
There are dozens of chairs decorated with greenery and wood in front of the Moscow Mary.
In the center of the stage, musicians play the dance.
It's a regional product festival called "There's Time."
"We've been going to have a local food party for a long time, and here, we've had a lot of sanctions, organized a festival," says one of the organizers.
On the scene with Greek drum musicians Anastas is making a salad made of macaroni and home confectionery, there was a master class on the day of the preparation of a boat with caramelized apples.
All Russian products are certified by organizers.
In the framework of the presentation of the achievements of the Russian population.
Honey from Baschiria, Olenina from Saleharda, from the sub-muscular "Sovhoza name Lenin", cheese from the obstetric Italian, Jay Clouz.
"The salmon for restaurants can be easily replaced by another salmon species from the Far East," says Philip Galkin, owner of the fish crayfish.
We've got nerves, ketchups, cockroaches, cockroaches, cockroaches, royal salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as a Norwegian salmon because it's a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is the same aquaculture.
You take him in your hand, he won't even move.
And you can't hold our far east salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace a national Italian mozarel
In the fall of his tent are the beds with the bar "Magadan", the grass, the omel, the muxun, the media with the Krem, the Countess from the Far East.
Galkin's sure it's been a long time since the Far East.
According to statistics, fish catches in Russia in 2013 amount to more than 4 million tonnes, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 were around 800 thousand tonnes.
His people have been working since 2012, selling fish through the Internet store, serving another half a dozen restaurants, such as "Spring things".
There have now been 15 more restaurants in Galkin.
The same droughts can be made from our fish, and it's burning.
We're tired, we've tried different recipes.
We're now selling droughts through the Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheap a couple of times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
Confirmed at the Galkin's uncle, they're making me a portion of Philadelphia with a cat.
Unlike the scrolls with seven, they have to eat longer, but the knowledge that this fish is our family adds strength.
On the site of "Your People" there's even the roles of the paltose and the seashell.
In the drylands, it is true that replacing the Norwegian salmon is preferable to Chilean.
Galkin explains that I'm going to make a new recipe with a long-term fish.
"Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us," explains owner Killfish Bar Dmitri Evseev.
The same situation with other products: Russian producers could take advantage of the free nest, but this did not happen.
According to the founder and owner of the LavkaLavka Boris Akimov project, it is now possible to talk more about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to replace the prohibited imports quickly, unlike our farmers.
That is to say, the main producers of other countries have won from the ban," Akimov says.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than product sanctions.
As a result of the mass out-of-the-art checks, the Rosustauzera has temporarily suspended the activities of three McDonald's companies in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg.
"We are studying the substance of the claims made to determine the actions needed to quickly open restaurants for visitors," said Dengam in McDonald's Press Service.
No one really understands what's going to happen.
If all is limited by product sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, - says an anonymity of a restaurant consultant.
If they start closing McDonald's all over the country, the script will be completely different.
"Europrotocol" instead of IDBDB files
Cascade payments can be received without an IDBB document, so the CB intends to promote the introduction of the Euro-Protocol in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft guidance that, from 1 September of this year, an insured car will be able to pay cash without the IDBD.
The truth is, it is only when an accident has been made on the "Europrotocol" without the involvement of the road police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the TTP, there were no physically injured persons, no damage exceeded the limit set, and both drivers reached agreement on the question of who was responsible for the accident.
From 2 August, the "Europrotocol" ceiling is 50 thousand rubbing, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad areas, it will increase to 400 thousand rubbings.
The fact is that even in cases of minor injuries, where the DTP can be formed through the “Europrotocol”, drivers who have fallen into an accident cause the DPS.
If there was a police officer, there was no way to get a refund without an IDBD file.
The parameters set out in the draft guidelines are designed to remove this obstacle to the introduction of the Europrotocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum cash payment for VAT made without IDBD staff should not be less than the limit for “Europrotocol”.
However, it cannot be higher than the limit set in the insurance contract for helmets.
The idea, of course, is useful and theoretically capable of unloading both DPS staff and roads.
Most likely, though, it will not be the driving force of cars or insurers.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which may lead to the introduction of new cash payment rules.
As far as drivers are concerned, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done in order to overcome the end-of-war Russian conservativeism.
In most cases, the driver will wait hours for the inspector to form a small accident, because it is more reliable.
And it is not yet known that it will be easier to beat the liars or convince the drivers of the 'europrotocol'.
The certificate shall be made by a name and by a non-repudiation
Minfin wants to ban the supplier's savings certificates, so he will allow banks to make them similar to the irrevocable contribution.
Minfin is preparing a bill that prohibits the supplier's safety certificates.
In recent times, this instrument has been gaining popularity, since the rates here are higher than for bank contributions.
The case is that the deposit insurance certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and the bank is treated in a cost-effective manner, as there is no need to make any deductions to the Fund of the Investment Insurance Agency (SAA).
The urgency of the situation is that this step is planned to take place because of small and medium-sized banks that issue such certificates and are affected by Sberbank and Bank Moscow, which, according to the ACV, control 98 per cent of the profile market.
However, the Bank of Moscow, according to the Agency, accounts for approximately 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the ASF, is that the clients of a small bank that has bought such a certificate are trying to obtain money in the ASF if it withdraws.
Some contributors may assume that their investments are insured without sufficient financial literacy and purchases of security certificates for the supplier.
The apparent lack of insurance payments for these certificates may lead to misunderstandings and social tensions in the event of withdrawal of a licence from the bank.
In practice, there were cases where the holders of the certificate attempted to obtain insurance compensation through the court," they said in ASV.
The problem is, of course, clever.
No one will be able to pay the buyers of the certificates anyway, since they have no right under the law to be reimbursed by the State.
If it were a case that an instrument was not insured in the ASV, it would also be prohibited to include metal accounts for which citizens' funds are taken into account in grams of one of the four metals, gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts also do not fall into the investment insurance system, but they are not being tried.
The case is most likely that the certificates on the applicant are a very valuable paper that can actually act as Quasidene.
However, their movement is virtually out of control: any client of the bank may purchase a certificate, pass it on to any citizen, and before such a certificate can change the number of owners.
The draft law does not provide that the certificate of protection must be a name-of-value paper to be stored in the depositary.
In order to sweeten the pill to the banks, such certificates shall be allowed to be issued without the right to an early termination.
That is to say, there is a similar unrelenting contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
The outcome was protested by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered at the center of Newport on March against NATO.
And on Sunday, at Cardiff, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff's rat at what was described as antisammite.
Stephen Fairklau followed us on the development of events during the exits and talked to protestors who came all the way from Bridgen to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will place weapons in Iraq to counter the militants from the Islamic State terrorist group, reporting on 31 August ITAR-TASS with reference to a decision taken following a meeting of representatives of the Government of Frog in the head with Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to send to Iraq 30 portable anti-tank missiles " Milan" and 500 charges, as well as 8,000 storms of G3 and G36.
The items will be implemented by the end of September.
In addition, the decision was made to allocate Iraq another 50 million euros for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will make a Government statement on the subject.
So far, Germany has not put its weapons in hot spots.
The views of the people of IWG on the dispatch of weapons to Iraqis have been divided.
Some believe that only the fighters from the Islamic State can be stopped, others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Policemen submerged the Ukrainian patrol station in the Asian Sea
The Donetsk militias had a Ukrainian patrol station in the Asian Sea, ITAR-TASS reported on 31 August.
According to the available data, this occurred in the Taganrog Bay near the Shirokino and the Inferno (10-20 km east of Mariupola).
A number of Ukrainian media reported a two-carriage attack on the coast guard.
It is clear that the incident occurred today at around 4:20 p.m.
Adolescents took the helicopters from the Blue Mountains
Two young busucokers were delivered to the helicopter in a safe place after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man were on a march shortly after Sunday at Govets Lip in Blackheit.
Concerned relatives called the police about eight nights before they returned home.
A search team was sent into the local police and rescue squad, and a couple found about 11 evenings around the Bridal Wayle Falls.
The girl had hurt her knees, and the young man had fallen and had his head pierced.
The officers stayed with the couple for the night, and they were picked up on the bed on Monday morning.
They were taken to the ambulance in a stable hospital in Blue Mountain.
Two Unions met
The negotiations at the summit in Minsk did not resolve the problems they had been brought up but gave rise to a new format: the first European Union members met with the first people of the future of the Eurasian
Let it also be alarmed (the situation around Ukraine of delays is not tolerated), EU leaders and the Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "burning problems".
If such a structure is capable of working effectively, it is impossible; therefore, it is clear who removed the branches from the summit.
This led to a fall on the evening of 26 August, when the Belarusians followed them and other Europeans saw the new President Lukashenko telenovate.
The Belarusian leader was an example of outstanding courtesy, it was the conduct of a man who had just broken the Jackpot - and planned a decent age in the highest society.
How Maydan Lucashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European Commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lucashenko and allowed him to address the final briefing on their behalf is not simply the legitimacy of the President with a 20-year stage.
This is an application for recognition by Minsk as a fully-fledged European policy entity and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The Senior Analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Research, Denis Meljanzov, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to talk to the Minas.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met a aunt with Lucashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will be frozen further," he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: the preparation for the collapse of the Belarusian authorities began long before the November Mayan in Kiev in 2013.
"The results have also been achieved with the EU - these are successful visa facilitation and readmission negotiations, dialogue on modernization - listed the interviewer Firenka, and international security negotiations have been held with the United States.
The States even removed some sanctions.
With regard to Ukraine's events, they themselves and their response to the leadership of Belarus have only led to this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, has managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko has been able to enter Belarus for negotiations.
Another was a Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the accession of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of the pro-Pro-Police militias in Donbass, who did not fight with Moscow.
Minsk did not come from the Customs Union, nor from the ODKB, but a Russian aviation base was located in Barranovic.
Brussels and Washington noted the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it by the Belarusian experts.
As long as the move to political diversification of Lukashenko has been successful, it will be evident how often in the near future Minsk will have to meet in the form of EU+TS.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Katherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions that Brussels expected from relations in a new format.
Press Secretary Ashton Maya Kosiancic said only "Fire", that in the face of war and peace issues, this issue was not a priority.
It was reported that the next meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format could also become Kazakhstan.
The Chief of Staff for Minsk has become a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbaeva, in which he acknowledged that he is personally requested by the representatives of the European Union.
However, in the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that not all parties objected to the fact that Minsk remained a central site for meetings both in the form of Russia-OSCE-Ukraine and at the level of Heads of State and High Representatives of the European Commission.
This means that "the last dictator of Europe" is the full-fledged European leader who helps solve the global problem.
Best Friend of the European Farmer
The membership of the EU delegation, including the European Trade and Energy Commissioners, has already emphasized the conclusion that the main sub-commitment of the summit is not the tragic situation in Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the timetable for future gas negotiations and against the fears of the countries of the TC on the Association Agreement with the EU is a more comprehensive achievement than the peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Carl De Gucht, however, pointed out that EU representatives had “come to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis, which had economic consequences rather than the opposite.”
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine "works" in Belarus in the economy.
Its consequences are, first and foremost, the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia, given to Minsk, which is currently experiencing the sanctions imposed on the manoeuvre.
According to the head of the Meses Research Centre, former candidate for the president of Belarus, Jaroslav Romančuk, European investors are actively interested in Belarus's ability to deliver agricultural products to the FF in the course of sanctions.
The supply schemes for which Vladimir Putin has hurried to the summit are being put forward.
"Initiators of this scheme," said Romanchuk "Fire," "are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out supply schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
The Russian business is urgently needed to restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian structures.
Second, the expert continues, because many Ukrainian companies do not want to create production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials as well as a Russian market.
Ukraine's producers have about 4 billion dollars of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian production trade schemes can now be very demanding."
In Romania's view, the role of the owner of the venue for EU and TS negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and in terms of economic relations with Europe.
He recalls that the EU agricultural sector's losses from Moscow's sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, while the European Commission has now offered only 125 million euros to farmers.
The Belarusian President may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for Eurofarmers.
This can raise the EU's authority to the unexpected height of Lukashenko.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the summit initiative.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk is re-elected from its active role in the TS+EU format, and the Belarusian leader at the meeting with the Ukrainian colleague stressed that the new format was the originator of Kiev.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any hesitation to discuss, not to decide from the barge, after signing the Treaty on Association with the EU, to deal with the situation that was then in Ukraine," he appealed to the camera to Peter Prosenko.
On the other hand, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which, according to the hearing, was against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increased its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic department, it is strongly stressed that Belarus does not pursue useful objectives in the organization of EU and TC interactions on its land, and the ultimate goal of such a format is the future of a single economic space from Lisbon to the Vladivostok.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that, in other areas, particularly in the field of security, promote and promote the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation," said Mr. Ognika in Mid-Belorussi, a department that has recently been scrupulously chosen.
In Moscow, there may be a free entry zone.
The Government of Moscow considers the introduction of pay-in zones as a means of combating overcrowding of central roads similar to other major cities of the world, reports M24.ru with reference to the Mosquire of Transport Maxim Liksutov.
One of the options that he has successfully recommended is a pay entrance.
That's an expert opinion, we'll have to study it, we'll look at all the negatives and the pluses.
To say that some decisions have been taken in this regard so far," said Liksutov.
He stressed that the capital authorities had a very important experience in Asian cities, which was similar to Moscow in terms of structure and load.
One of the decisions taken by these countries is the already being implemented construction of the central wheel road, Likstuov added.
The recent construction of the Central Wheel Road is an example of not having to miss all traffic through Moscow.
If there was enough traffic infrastructure, there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow," said the mayor.
Maxim Likstuov also stated that the introduction of pay-parks significantly destroyed the steel streets.
And, according to him, the customs authorities are not planning to halt the progress made.
On 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobianin, attended the ceremony of the building of the first Moscow Central Road Road (CCAD).
Temporarily incorrect
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodríguez "The City of Sins 2: The woman for whom it is worth killing" did not complete the revolution that could have been expected of him.
The first "Golden of Sins" (2005), which was removed from the minimal but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, has revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary novels.
The cycle is also revolutionary: in the sense that it destroys the fundamentals for modern thinking of the "thesis-antithesis-synthesis" (if you understand under these universe nuars and under the antithesis-comic space).
It should now be read: "thesis is antithesis is chaos."
"The City of Sins-2" is chaotic at both the dramatic and the philosophical level: he is chaotic at both times in the foolish sense of the word.
Yes, some heroes are familiar with the first "Gordo", although, here, the Marv (Micky Rourke) is remembered to have ended up living on an electric chair, and here, nothing but succeeds in exorcising - as part of the role of a folk wife - from the air of the knife and other punches.
But the elders literally lash out with pieces of novels, like breaking into the city from another film, about the meaning and the context of which viewers ask not to worry.
So, his story, unreasonably beaten by the authors in the most interesting place, is in the superlative game of Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
It's with Eva Green (Eva Green) and something she's got for Dwight (Jos Brooklyn).
But let's say that this trick in which Duyita is not to distinguish himself from Johnny -- the more people, as well as other parts of the body, suffer from incredibly regularity, not misery, not even weakness.
It's not people, but we understand that it's an archetype of nuara: a year-old bitch who's too confident of herself playing a "moon hunt" of a sex detective, a corrupt senator.
Well, when the archetype works with the archetype and the archetype runs, it's not a movie anymore, but it's an abstract life.
And to ask abstract questions about the logic of the subject is just funny.
Also, even in this sad world, there is something permanent.
Warheads from the first "Gorda" continue to maintain a circular defense against their native slums of the darkness.
Yeah, and Detective Hartigan's ghost isn't gonna look at the fire, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem of "The City of Sins-2" is the other.
Frank Miller was good at the fact that the painter had a talented comic book and a nuar, and the director had turned the idea of how to put comics on the screen.
Comics and nuars are two aggressively opposite "realities".
The phenomenon of modern comics was born at the end of the 1920s, when the Roman Daschila Hemmet "Crowding Jawat" (1929), "Maltian Soccoli" (1930) and "The Glass Key" (1931) created a cannon called the hard-boiled school.
Well, or pulp fiction.
The comics gave to Gollivud many dozens of heroes: from the sailor Pope, a spy who gave him a rich power, Superman, Batman and the treasurer Dick Tracy to Halka, Tora, Man-Pauka and others.
But in any comic film, there was something harmful: the painted characters did not want to grow a screen, remain a force in the surrounding world's "real" world of their will-slaves.
I'm just saying, they were completely devoid of "existence".
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After World Wars, the traditional novel, with its anxieties, character, family scandals, and historical background, has lost all confidence.
What sites, such as Tibo and Rugon-Makcara, even the Balkan and Rostos are generally considered after Verden, Osvencim and Hiroshima?
Such a novel was peacefully mutated in the form of a mill, and the criminal was defined as a marginal novel that rose to the level of the philosophical prose.
Hemmet found out on his skin that it's like working a sanitizer on the front.
He was a communist.
Like, they were at least close to the party and the columns of the genre, such as authors Horas McCoy and Jim Thompson, director Julessen, Joseph Louzi, Edward Dmitrick.
So the nuar, whose archetype they put, first, rough and cynical, and secondly, very social.
That's not the American version of socrealism.
The first "Cat of Sins" was remarkable because it was unnatural, but organically combined comics with nuara.
For the first time on the screen, the comic book was alive, not to feel any tension with its graphic nature, but to be a "present" movie.
The dark of the world of sale, where the cardinal ordered the murder, and the senator covered the monster son-in-law, was worthy of Hemmet.
And the pictures of the sort of cut heads that the sadist decorated his nest, the former genius James Ellroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best - is a declaratively gifted representative of the Neonoura.
"The City of Sins-2" is not even a retreat, but the capitalization of the radical stylistic of Miller-- Rodriguez before the comic tradition.
It's probably a lot of things that happened because of 3D technology.
When you look at the second "Crowd of Sins", you feel trapped in a glass layer in which the snow is falling asleep.
However, most of all, it's not snow, it's blood scars, but what's the difference?
Well, it's about socialism and it's about something.
It is possible only when we have a place where we sometimes have to let go to the edge of a dirty mud, but there is a normal world where we can bring back a girl who is on the path, or, say, to the helpless parents, that the loser is punished.
But when there is no place for sin in the city, there is no place for sin but for sin; and there is no sin but the law.
It's boring, like any rule.
The chaos of "The City of Sins 2" is simply boring.
Justice for the domestic curse has given this precious sin a small but perch.
The titres warn: the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
In terms of maturity, in the very vegan episode that is broken by the fingers of a human being, it gives a hell of a jumor.
Hemmet would like it.
French Socialists should "close and bring France in order," said key ally Frasua Holland
Mr. Wall called for deep-separate left forces to "show a warm attitude" to attack the President-in-Office of the socialist whose regimes had not been approved by the overwhelming majority of Frenchmen.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, calling out applause.
As a sign of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured his Government that it would not question the 35-hour working week in France, despite a heated conflict, it would have to weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland asked his socialist party associates to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Kristian Tobár, Minister of Justice, put his fingers in the wheel, contributing to the gathering of the disagreeable members of Parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lost faith in the future”.
Marin Le Pe, the leader of the extremely right National Front, expressed contempt for permanent internal conflicts among Socialists, said she did not imagine that the new Walla Government would last for a few months.
François Holland is a naked king, but a white prince and Prince Manuel Wall, who is forced to gather a new government when the summer had not lasted.
"There will also be no autumn or winter," Mrs. Penn told reporters.
She reiterated her party's call for parliament's dissolution, said she was confident that the party could easily win in the early elections and be ready to manage.
The ruling party of France has survived a riot at the March municipal elections, and the extremely right National Front has arrived first at the EU elections in May.
The survey of the resurrected Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French people believed that the Socialist Party was at risk of being divided into several rival factions until the end of the President's term of office of Mr. Holland in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a politician at the University of Cyan Po, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government could not fix the economy and the recordless unemployed.
"He has little time, but the public opinion needs to feel quickly about what's going on," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"A country without drugs" is missing.
The Sverdlovska arbitral tribunal left without consideration the request of the Regional Ministry for the Management of Hostility to the State Without Drugs fund.
The government intended to recover more than 7 million rubs from the organization as a rental fee for the building in the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear twice in court.
Today, the arbitral tribunal of the Sverdlovska area has left without consideration the executive direction of the Ministry of State Property Management (IUGISO) to the State-free fund (one of the founders - Mayor Ekaterinburg Evgenie Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities were seeking to recover from the organization 7.3 million rubs as a rent fee for the building.
It was known today that the complainant had not appeared twice before the court, and therefore a decision had been taken to refuse the hearing.
Due to the lack of representatives in the IUGISO Directorate, the Chief of Law, Maxim Titov, did not respond to telephone calls.
The Fund ' s representatives were also unable to contact.
It is recalled that the specialty that has been in the city centre on the street of Belinski, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
Such a decision was taken by former Governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property Management of Sverdlovska District applied to the Sverdlovska arbitral tribunal for the removal of the fund from the building.
According to the claim, the Authority requested through the court to recognize an unencumbered contract of free use in the premises of the monument.
In the opinion of the IUGISO Directorate, the agreement did not include substantial conditions for the rental of cultural heritage.
The Sverdlovska arbitral tribunal rejected the claim, and the 17th arbitral tribunal, Permi, which was satisfied, was appealed.
Then, in the same court, the fund filed a cassation complaint against the decision, which remained unsatisfying, after which the decision was appealed by the fund in the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court took the side of the board.
In 2013, a new lease contract was concluded, on which the fund began to pay the rent again, as the head of the city of Evgenie Roizman described it.
The rental fee was set at 300 thousand rubs a month.
The previous area administration transferred this building to us for free, recognizing our rights to fight drugs, in respect of the fund.
The current administration has decided otherwise," he said.

Why Mayor Ekaterinburg offered to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, Ekaterinburg's proud deputy, Alexander Kosinzev, suggested that the mayor of the city, Evgjan Roizman, be retired.
The case served as a criminal case for the suspect in the murder of a retired member of the pride of Oleg Kinev, who was considered a mayor's accomplice.
How the Evegation of the Rosemoon Found Criminal Case
On 1 July, it became known that a criminal case had been initiated under the “crime” (art. 128.1 UC RF) in the Ekaterinburg Mayor of Evgenia Roizman's blog.
This was reported to the IMF in the Sverdlovska area, where Anna Filatov, the legal director of the Law Centre, made a statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her in her blogging that she was involved in the crimes she had allegedly committed by her ex-wife.
Mary Ekaterinburg is convinced that "this is a regular attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone turns into a cookie
Before 9 September, when Apple is due to submit its new development, the press will have all the new leaks that could be expected from the presentation.
With reference to sources, American media reported that the sixth generation of iPhone would be equipped with cell phones as a result of the joint project Apple and Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Re/code Internet Resource, on 9 September, Apple can also announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, resulting in a new iPhone 6 smartphone.
The companies themselves have rejected any comments on this matter.
This function allows you to pay cash in a store with the help of a smartphone.
The identification of the payment will be carried out by the user on his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be the first time the NFC (near field communication) technology will be installed, which allows for a non-contact payment using a smartphone and the appropriate cash-counting device.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The first NFC function was presented in 2004 as part of the cooperation of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and hundreds of other companies in the so-called NFC Forum, the Association for the Promotion of Technology.
The first NFC phone was issued by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC function - Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google presented a Google Wallet system that allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and to pay off using a smartphone on Android.
However, American experts stress that, despite major investments by high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, the US riders are still careful about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on their stores with such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple's entry into this market will make it more rapid and active to implement this technology at its trading points.
Mid-France: Paris's position on supplies to Russia "Mistralai" does not change
The official representative of Mid France, Roman Nadal, stated that Paris was a permanent position on the delivery of the "Mistral" helicopters to Russia.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (France) in his interview with Le Monde on 20 August: " Today's level of sanctions does not prevent supply.
This is the decision of Europeans, not of France," he quoted Mr. Nadal "RIA News".
Thus, the representative of the French foreign policy department replied to the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would result in a change in the position of Paris to implement this contract.

Norwegian Cruise is approaching the $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is at the final stage of negotiations for the acquisition of a similar company Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to reports of people familiar with the situation.
The transaction would provide Norwegian Cruise, companies with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to luxury cruise ships and secured customers of Prestige Cruises, as it competes with larger competitors of the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced this week, and sources reported on the Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
The sources were asked to remain anonymous, as negotiations were not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, runs 13 cruise ships on roads covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 per cent more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Brands Oceania and Regent, which are jointly owned by eight cruise ships operating in Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than a year earlier.
It is expected that the $29 billion cross-cutting industry will benefit from an increase in the middle class in developing economies such as China and India in the years to come.
The promotion companies seek to position themselves as cross-operators preferred by these new clients.
Prestige Cruises was registered in U.S. regulators for the initial public placement of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the principal shareholder of the company after a $850 million transaction in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it is now, in 2000, as a result of a merger with a cruise operator belonging to Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and casino under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Teya.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting had a share of 28 per cent, Apollo had a share of 20 per cent, and the private investment company TPG Capital LP had a share of 8 per cent in the company, as reported at the end of June, according to the reporting.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises together account for 82 per cent of the cross-country traffic in North America, according to registration documents at the first public location of Prestige Cruises.
The Krem radio company can get 250 million rubles of subsidies
In Minsk, Russia is proposing to allocate 250 million rubles to the State Radio company "Crim" in 2014.
As indicated in the draft order of the Minkomsvezi, which is located on a single portal to disclose information on the preparation of regulations, the subsidy is planned to be spent “to cover the cost of creating conditions for the wide dissemination of the socio-economic situation and the development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.
Money will also go to the purchase of equipment, roof repair and power supply systems in the 1959 radio company building, reports RIA News.
Activists of the Hong Kong Democratic Movement echo the Chinese representative's statement the next day after the election decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood near the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the All-China People's Assembly on Sunday defined a procedure whereby only two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the elections of the Hong Kong leader in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support from the majority of members of the Movement Committee, which is likely to be the domain of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to fall into the ballot and has forced the democratic movement activists to promise again to stop Hong Kong's financial centre with the "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as China's party leaders are afraid that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of the Beijing document describing China's control of Hong Kong in June, democratic movement activists held an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city centre and set up a sit-down.
Briefing Li is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Office for Communications in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the People's Assembly of the People's People's People's Republic of Hong Kong and Macao of the Feng Wei State Council also had to make a series of briefings during the day.
Activists stated that they would gather at the Hong Kong Government ' s headquarters in the second half of the day.
Britain has not mentioned the democratic administration for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to join 400 ha of the land belonging to Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities announced that they would join 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, owned by Palestinian autonomy.
According to Bibi-si, the decision to join the country by South Wifley is linked to the desire to pay for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June of this year.
The Ministry of Defence of Israel declared on Sunday that it had ordered military administration on the west coast.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, the world community should call upon Israel to respond to “the ongoing settlement activity on the west bank of Jordan and East Jerusalem”.
Putin demands that Kiev start negotiations on "statehood" in eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government cease fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the " statehood " of the region.
His Press Secretary, Dmitri Peskov, later explained that Putin had no intention of suggesting that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of the separatists would be part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine should be revised to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putina's call to the Kiev Government to start negotiations with the pro-Pro-Russian rebels in line with the obvious strategy that she had been in since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: To help separatists to take the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossia real independence to approach Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with Putin State's First TV channel, the Ukrainian military campaign against the return of detained separatists in eastern Donecka and Lugana, which were captured in March and April after Moscow's annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula to Crimea on 18 March, was condemned.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently been called the occupied territories of Novorossia, or New Russia, which refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace talks would take place in the near future when Ukrainian policies began campaigning for parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government forces were attacking peaceful settlements in detained separatists in the regions, “the guardian of illusions”, ITARS reported.
"We must start the substantive negotiations immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political device of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, to express the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putina's state-of-the-art words were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussing for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm the fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict”.
The intervention of the secretary of the Kremlin to correct the “infidel interpretation” of Putina emphasized the decision of the Russian leadership to deal with the separatist uprising in the east rather than the open arrest of Crimea, where most of the 2 million people were ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much more difficult battle to join even the Doneck and Lugani area of eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million non-Russians were non-Russians, and prior to the beginning of the conflict there was widespread support for the wish to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy discussed by the Russian diplomats in international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, by handing Kremlin the actual control over the territory, which would unite the main territory of Russia with Crimea.
In the Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, there was a major Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and the Crimea, there are also mines, factories and Lithuanian factories that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko proposed, during his opening speech on 7 June, that after the new elections, Ukrainian legislators should postpone amendments to the Constitution to allow the regions to exercise greater control over their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy appears to be very different from that of Kremlin and the separatists in whose weapons and incitements Moscow is accused.
Putina's last call to Kiev to agree with the separatist leaders, as well, followed the new arrivals of the rebels last week after the Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from before the peace zone along the Azov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took over the city of Novozazovsk in the event that Ukrainian security officials said they were afraid that it was the beginning of a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory before the Crimea itself.
This has resulted in extensive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupola, a stable port of 50,000 inhabitants, which is between the Novozazov and the close passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, the European Union leaders gathered in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which had been independent for 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of no return," Warner warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a draft more severe sanctions against Russia, which would be adopted in the event of an escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Addisk after two columns of Russian Bronze Engineers and 1,000 soldiers had entered the Doneck region last week to support the difficulties encountered by separatists, Colonel Andrey Lysenko, the Press Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, informed reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were reportedly detained in Addis Ababa as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday with 10 Russian air carriers arrested in the Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko reported on Sunday.
The photo scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his aversion to the hackers who might have stolen photos of his bride, Gabi Greco, and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood was upset by the fact that a number of open-ended photographs by Jennifer Lourens were on the Internet as a result of a massive hacker scandal with celebrities.
They say that the hacker, responsible for this, has about 60 photographs of the star "Golden Games" Lawrence and the superstar, including the Kate Appton and Kara Delevin, the singer Rianna, Ariana Grande and Lia Michel and the actress Kirsten Danst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Ivonn Strahovski and who live in Melbourne Greece also reportedly stole photos from iCloud.
In list 101, the name of the celebrities.
Edelsten, who made a proposal to Greece last month, said confidential: "This is disgusting."
All private censuses and photographs must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to others.
Greco, who is in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was "posterous" and that the one she was being sent to "see that they were attacked".
The hacker is supposed to have 30 photos of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Spidman, including two frames where she's in the pool with her chest.
Palmer's work in the movie includes "Love and Honor" along with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, a movie star "Chak" Strahovski and an actress from "Restricted Admission" Browning yesterday did not comment on stolen photographs.
Representative Lawrence said TMZ: "This is a sudden invasion of private life."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his displeasure at the hacker, writing on Twitter: "Puting photos stolen from the mobile phone is really nothing different from selling stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen photographs cannot be tolerated.
A potential way to steal photos of detected celebrities has been found
A massive breakdown of the stars may be caused by vulnerability in the Find My Phone annex.
The potential scenario for the development of events described the resources of The Next Web.
A Python script was published to Gitub, which enabled you to select the password for the Find My Phone service of Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of your iPhone.
The same connection to the Apple ID and password is used for accessing it, as well as for access to the Apple iCloud cloud from which photos of celebrities have been stolen.
The script enabled you to retrieve a password from Find My Phone.
With this method, all possible combinations of symbols are consistently introduced, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that the number of password inputs in the Find My Phone service was unlimited.
In the correct organization of the security system after several unsuccessful attempts, the wrong password should be blocked and the user informed of the breach.
Because of vulnerability, users received no reports of attempts to improve their account password.
The hackers found an Apple ID password and used it to access iCloud.
According to the Twitter user Hackapp, vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and it wrote a script program for the selection of passwords.
To date, vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource was connected to the Hackapp user and he noted that the above vulnerability was characteristic of many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability was used to access the star account.
It's not me, plz RT
On Twitter, the Prime Minister again appeared on the sidelines
While there was no strong evidence that the theft of photographs had been used in finding My Phone vulnerabilities, the use of this service had already been harmful.
The hackers took over the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple stated to the media that the security of the cloud had not been compromised, but did not investigate how users had lost their accounts.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedev's Twitter has also been hacked earlier in Russia.
If the criminals had access to the iCloud as described above, there could be a password for the Government ' s head account in the micrologging service.
The Next Web resource has not been able to get Apple's comments on the vulnerability to Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to Ukraine ' s five-board
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to a well-known Ukrainian athlete Anne Burjek.
The relevant order is published on the web portal of legal information.
At the beginning of this year, the sportsman moved to Russia to a permanent place of residence and asked the Federation to provide her with an opportunity to speak for the RF collection.
In 2013, she won two phases of the World Cup, won a silver medal for Europe's championship in private and became a world champion in a mixed stadium, which is one of the new types of sports programmes.
It also holds leadership positions in the current season.
In accordance with the rules for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, it will be required to obtain a special authorization from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee.
Anna Burrick is not the first Ukrainian sportsman to change his nationality.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian chess passport to Ekaterin Lagno, the Livova harvester, a two-time European champion (2005, 2008), peace in the vicinity (2010) and quick chess (2014).
A female team of Ukrainian sportsmen was the winner of the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the world championship in Astana (2013) and the European team championship in Warsaw (2013).
SCR terminated investigation of the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo
The Russian Investigation Committee (RCC) has terminated the criminal case of the aircraft crash of the Red Wings.
This is reported by the press department.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the commander of the aircraft and the shipowner.
The trial has shown that the cause of the disaster has been an increase in landing speed, failure to implement standard landing procedures, as well as an unintended exit of engines for increased direct traffic.
The Red Wings Airplane, following the Prague-Moscow flight, was violated on 29 December 2012 when it landed at the Moscow airport of Vnukovo.

The anger was the most universal and functional human emotion.
A hearty person is biologically universal to humanity, and every member of the body and group of muscles is not random, but is an additional means of expression of power and threats, the scientists of Australia and the United States have identified.
They told about their openings in the magazine Evolution and Human Behavior, and they can be read briefly in the press release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.
Angry expression is the persons who are pushed down and down the bridges, drawn in a thin line of loss, scattered nostrils are the same in all cultures, and make it even blind from the birth of a child, never seen him, notes the lead author of the Aron Sell study.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists found that this emotion had arisen to deal effectively with disputes during the conflict.
The more physical damage one can cause to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his circumstances, and he brings it to the interviewer with anger.
Researchers have found confirmations and another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and go to handcuffs, consider themselves to be entitled to impose other disadvantages on them, as well as to prefer powerful ways of resolving conflicts peacefully.
Apart from the fact that anger is primarily a “emotion of the market”, scientists have concluded that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles that create a hearty expression of persons should be more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interviewer, thus making it possible to agree as soon as possible with his or her conditions in order to avoid conflict.
To verify this hypothesis, the researchers modeled and showed them to the informants on a computer where each of the seven elements of an angry person was present or not.
Although the abandoned bridges or the pointed forwards of the submarines did not make a person evil, the more powerful physical participants of the human race recognized the same.
Man’s anger, as in animals, is a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of his own power, forcing him to accept and obey.
A man breaks his nose and lifts his lips for the same purpose as a couch that rises, or a baboon that shows his claws.
“Angrily “begins” by refusing to accept the situation, and the person immediately adopts a form that is most effective in demonstrating the opposite side of the refusal.
But the most devastating is that none of the components of an angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same thing," said Anthropologist John Tuby.
