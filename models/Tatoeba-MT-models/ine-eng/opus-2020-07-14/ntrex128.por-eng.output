Members of the Assembly of the Wales Country are afraid to "pass through Marretas"
There is a consensus by some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) on the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Galês Parliament Members).
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly for "Galês Parliament".
Some members of this House, from all political backgrounds, were afraid that this would make them laugh.
One AM worker said that the group is concerned about the fact that "the designation rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For non-galese readers: in Galese language, "twp" means "Idiot" and "pwp" means "excrements".
A Plaid AM said that the group in its globality "was not content" and suggested alternatives.
A French Conservative said that the group was "open-minded" about the change of name, but said that the MWP designation was literally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in galese has a statement similar to that of the letter or in the English of Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Assembly, currently drafting legislation to introduce the amendments to the name, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the Assembly are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves".
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave its assembly the powers to change names.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which registered a general support for the proposal to appoint the meeting by 'Galês Parliament'.
On the issue of the title of the AMs, the Commission favoured "Galês Parliament's Members", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favourable in public consultation.
The AMs are apparently suggesting alternatives, but the effort to gather consensus can be a headache for the President, Elin Jones, who should present a draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other amendments to the way in which the assembly carries out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AMs and the configuration of the committee system.
When they discuss legislation, the AMs will have the final word on the question of how to be designated.
Macedonians will refer to the change of country name
The electors will vote on Sunday on the change of their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a conflict of decades with neighboring Greece, which integrates a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has been very insisting that the name of its neighbor to the north constitutes a claim on its territory, having repeatedly objected to its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposition to the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the rapporteur's supporters, among them Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is no more than the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
Sons of St. Martin calms at a time when the churches of Harlem struggle for survival
"No historical perspective, the elders I spoke to told me that there was a bar and a church on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's neither one."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, got it.
"People socialize differently" today, he said.
"The bars have stopped being the living rooms of the neighborhood where people are heading regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned about the possibility of the money gained with the sale of heritage not to last as long as the leaders expect" and that, sooner or later, everything will return exactly to the point of departure."
The churches, added, can be replaced by apartments with condominiums inhabited by people who will not support the sanctuaries of the neighborhood that still remain.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so will the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, for it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was then laid by a black congregation that carried out its worship in the immediate vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the 125th Street lodgers, an important commercial street in Harlem that resisted the recruitment and promotion of black workers.
A fire in 1939 left the building seriously damaged. However, when they made plans for their reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the carriage.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the carriage "the signs of the poor".
The specialist who touched the carriage in July called it another thing: "a cultural treasure" and a "historical instrument irreplaceable".
This specialist, Tiffany Ng, at the University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the first carriage of the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the largest carriage in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace it.
What happened in St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish made up of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that this "procurator would pass over the costs", unfortunately the fact that he was not involved in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tubarão causes injuries in a 13-year-old teen in a lice-hunting dive in California
A pipeline attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a hunting dive at the Lagos in California on the first day of the Lagos season, the authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help, then finished in his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was only a matter of enthusiasm for having caught a hostage, but then he realized that the boy was shouting "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The entire clavicle area was dilated, Hammel described what he observed when he arrived at the boy.
"I cried to everyone to get out of the water: "There's a tube in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The type of tube responsible for the attack is unknown.
The life-saving Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that had been alerted to a tube in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the trunk.
The authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for research and security reasons.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of tubers in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetic market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with cosmetic sections in the style of large warehouses, supported by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain a quota on the UK cosmetic market, assessed at 2.8 billion pounds, which has continued to grow as sales of fashion clothing and articles for home return, these major cosmetic sections will be tested in 11 stores distributed by the country and will be implemented in more stores in the year that comes if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics results from the search by supermarkets in ways to use other exposure space used for TVs, microwaves and household articles.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would duplicate its beauty product catalogue with the offer of up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oréal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand areas similar to those of the Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its range of boutique makeup to make most of the products comply with vegan recipes, something more and more required by younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London, last week. It is expected that the second one, in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, opens near the end of the year.
Online purchases and changing food shopping habits for small daily quantities in nearby stores have led to the fact that supermarkets now have to make more efforts to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses, at a time when the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has come to install Argos sales points in hundreds of stores, also having installed a series of Habitats, since he acquired both chains two years ago, and says that this has strengthened the sales of merchandise products and made the purchases most profitable.
The company's previous attempt to renew its departments of cosmetics and pharmacies ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a difference on the distribution of revenue from health products stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy emerges after Sainsbury's three years of selling his pharmaceutical business with 281 points of sale to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores a wide range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and essence of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the customer.
Our range of brands has been designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an insatiable point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways to make purchases."
Peter Jones "burning" after Holly Willoughby left business 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, the Dragons Den star, became "furnished" after the TV show Holly Willoughby had abandoned a business of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of articles for the home and True accessories.
The business of both had been compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of this Morning, 37 years old, announced in Instagram that he would abandon the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons Dan Peter Jones star when he left the lucrative brand in the last minute to concentrate on his new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones became "furnished" when the gold girl admitted, during a tight meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new business (which value can go up to 1.5 million pounds) meant that he would stop having time to dedicate himself to his brand of household articles and Truly accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to duplicate Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced in Instagram that he would leave True, Jones was picking up a plane for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said, "Truly was far above Holly's priorities.
It would mean the long-term resolution of its future and would be financial support for the next two decades.
Your decision to leave left everyone absolutely scared.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of items ready to sell in Marlow's headquarters."
Experts believe that the outcome of this Morning presenter, which is among the most lucrative stars in Britain, can cost the company millions, given the increased investment in products, which go from lunches and watch the clothes and articles for the home, and from the potential for additional delays in the launch.
Moreover, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and Dan Baldwin's husband, are close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp ten years ago.
Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the project as president in March.
The couple make vacations together and Jones has a 40% share in the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I'm The Celebrity of ITV program.
A nearby source of Jones said last night that "We don't want to comment on your business".
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
The President of the United States made a playful mention of the criticisms that would be the target of the media by making a comment that some would consider a "indignity of a president" and by revealing such a positive attitude to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said, in his fake voice of "telejournal pivo".
"I didn't give up on anything."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, and stressed that it would be a big step in the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for denuclearization are drawing up.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the most important North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North sees no "corresponding " response from the United States to the first steps towards disarmament in North Korea.
Instead, he said, the US continues to impose sanctions for maintaining pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic point of view in his speech at the beginning.
"It's running very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been dead.
We now have this excellent relationship."
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim led to positive results: the end of the fire tests, support for the liberation of hostages and the return to the country of the dead remains of US soldiers.
In addition, he defended his approach when he spoke in relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of them.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia cause destruction on an island, causing the death of hundreds of people
In the heat of the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was said to foreign non-governmental organizations that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had been unoccupied, no national disaster was declared, a pre-requisite for the channelling of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they were, in many cases, clear to say that they are not asking for international help; therefore, it becomes a little difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the national disaster response agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes of Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although it has been built in Aceh, shelters against tsunamis are not formally alerted to other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a series of tsunami alarms in Palu, a bad degree of validity of a warning, had contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, travelling among many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to deal with earthquakes victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new disaster.
President Joko Widodo, who made the improvement of the infrastructure decreases a central part of his electoral campaign, spent enormous amounts on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr Joko's executive, at a time when he faces his re-election in the coming year.
The president is also being pressured by the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative way of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were evicted while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes a long finish for the empate goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal on the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's bag, with his team losing for 1-0.
He gave a touch to his left before he made a finish towards the second track.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the big area when heading to the top right corner of the network.
In the end, the ball fell on an Arrizabalaga Kepa on a flight and fell inside the network.
"I was just trying to reach that position, to go to the ball, and the players like Shaq made as much progress as possible, so I was just making as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I had a touch, and I didn't think too much about it. I just finished."
Chelsea won for 1-0 at the interval after marking a goal in the 25th minute, from the Belgian Eden Hazard star.
In this game, the progress of the blues gave a step back to Mateo Kovacic before unmarking near the midfield and performing a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick middle-field pass.
Then he made a beautiful finish that crossed the counter-defence, leading Hazard to the great area.
This overrun the defenses and made the goal against the network of the second track with a finish with the left foot that passed through the Alison Becker network of Liverpool.
Liverpool faces Naples in the group phase of the League of Champions at three o'clock on Thursday afternoon, at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face the videoton at the UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. in London.
Number of deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia rise to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, at the beginning of Sunday the country's disaster response agency declared.
There are reports that describe a large number of people trapped in the ruins of buildings that disappeared during the magnitude earthquake 7.5 on Friday, which triggered waves that reached the 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said, the agency's spokesman, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the ruins of the ruined buildings.
Police arrests a man 32 years of suspicion of murder after the disappearance of a woman until death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The victim, 44 years old, was found at 7:55 a.m. in the morning with gun wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street, having a 32-year-old man arrested for murder.
The police have urged the population in the area that may have witnessed something to give information.

I also want to appeal to those who may have obtained pictures with tables, particularly taxi drivers, who contact us, because they may have crucial information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was located within a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the victim went to the site of the incident to investigate the place where she had been found this morning.
The investigations are under way, with the police saying that they are currently reporting to the next relatives of the victim.

Parliament's Cromwell statue became the most recent monument swallowed by the content of "historic revisionism"
His removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for his destruction, which reminds the perpetuity of the Taliban, of so many cultural and religious English artifacts, and which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that, in the current debate on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell's figure next to the Westminster Palace would become an aim of abstinence.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the acts of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testimony of the 19th century's opinion and from historiography to a figure that many still believe to be worthy of honor.
Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is addressed by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of the monarchy.
If this is the case, or not an entirely precise description, it is the subject of a further historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th-century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents one side of this division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and commemoration."
Dog killer attack and kill Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to reports of local media.
The man, identified only by his so-called "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut and covered blood artery, near a pocket in the market in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, read in South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farmer prepares to inject pigs vaccines in a pig culture on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, you will have traveled with the cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to an open neighbor's pocket.
In that pocket, he said, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig had attacked the pig until death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered with blood and crushed, said the cousin, referred to by his so-called "Wu", according to Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage show Yuan entering the market at 440 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent other people from attacking while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Reports state that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on human beings have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in her fifth in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig with 300 kilos immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to scare the animal.
After a Oregon farm had been eaten by its pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can work as "stimulous".
"They're just playing.
They like to beautify, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them due respect," he said.
Residues of the Rosa furcan should bring strong generalized rain to the southwest of the United States
As expected, the Rosa furcan is weakened by moving on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains to all the north and south-west of the United States in the coming days.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, in the east of Sunday, the Rosa caused redundancies of 137 km/h, a category 1 hole, located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
However, it begins to take shape a depression on the Pacific Ocean that moves to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the peninsula of Baja California, Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical humidity towards the north in the south-west area of the United States.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation which can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, tropical humidity interacting with the approaching depression will produce strong rains widespread in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain may cause dangerous sudden floods, storms of destruction and possibly desert lands.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation were expected in southwest areas, especially over most of Arizona.
They are possible sudden flooding with the conditions in rapid aggravation due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is highly unadvisable to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
The strong precipitation can cause the defilades to become good rivers and the encounters will bring strong windpoints and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring with it strong precipitation over parts of the southern coast line of California.
Total precipitations of more than 12 mm may be possible, which may cause small spills of debris and steep roads.
This may be the first precipitation of the region's wet station.
They will begin to take place in Arizona some scattered tropical waters at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered at the end of Monday and on the third.
The strong rain will spread on the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last up to fourth.
The month of October can record strong temperature variations throughout the U.S. territory as the Arctic cools. However, tropical areas will remain quite threatening.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes in short distances.
There is an excellent example of the dramatic differences in temperature throughout the central U.S. area on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will tend to increase and expand again.
It is hoped that much of the central and eastern U.S. area will begin in October, with temperatures ranging from 27 to 30 degrees from the South Planets to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach the 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States until the end of the first half of October.
Over 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people attended six television stations yesterday at Brett Kavanaugh's witnesses, appointed to the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political impasse continued, with the stations interrupting regular programming due to a turnaround of the last hour: an agreement drawn up by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that he had absolute certainty that Kavanaugh had beaten her while she was drunk and tried to disarm her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed witness, said he has absolute certainty that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, numbered by Nielsen on Friday, have attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of viewers in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The numbers of the other stations that transmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring hearings of those who see programs in offices.
To give some perspective, this is a level of hearings similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the hearing that lasted all day, referred to Nielsen.
The ABC was seconded by 3.26 million spectators.
Then comes CBS 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen referred to.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the Office of the moderate Republican issued a statement stating that its vote would be in favour of Kavanaugh, the senator was arrested by the CNN and CBS chambers on Friday morning to be verbally attacked by protesters when he tried to enter a lift to address a hearing of the Judicial Commission.
The senator remained immovable to look to the ground while he was being criticized directly to the CNN cameras.
"I'm here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you have power while so many women have no power."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would say more at the committee hearing.
The cable and radio stations were all covering the event in just hours later, when the Judicial Commission voted to make the appointment of Kavanaugh continue to vote in plenary session of the Senate.
However, Flake said that he would only do so in the sense that the FBI would investigate the charges against him during the next week, something the democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation by the FBI into allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
The Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of his plans to abandon the European Union to "politicise" with the future of Britain and to harm national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservatory Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
Another interview with which he gave on the first page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the Minister's "Checkers Plan" for Brexit, stating that a proposal that provides for Britain and the EU to cover the prices of the other party is "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims Homicide: police arrest the suspect Dyteon Simpson of the LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect of Sims' death shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player in the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department's communication.
The authorities released a video of the comparison between Sims and Simpson, with the police claiming that Sims lost his eyes during the fight.
The police recovered them at the scene and declared that they had found Simpson's DNA, news to WAFB, a CBS subsidiary.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said that he had killed Wayde with a firearm.
A loan of USD 350 000 was established, the lawyer said.
The medical-legal office of the East Baton Rouge parish issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head extending to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the state police action group in Louisiana, the criminal lab of the state police, the South University police and residents of the area involved in the investigation led to this detention.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the authorities in the area for their "diligence and effort to get justice".
Yeah, he was 20 years old.
This advanced, 1.98 m high, grew in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Its average was 5.6 points and 2.6 highlights per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "damaged" and "in shock" for Wade's death.
"That's what we care about for eternity," Wade said.
Vulcan ejects ashes in Mexico City
Emanating ashes of the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the south coast of the capital of Mexico.
On Sunday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 gas and ashes emissions within 24 hours.
The center has detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images in the social networks showed fine layers of ashes covering the car vans in the neighborhoods of Mexico City as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometres from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Comparisons between the Catalan police and separatists before the voting anniversary for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independent protesters and the intervention police, while thousands of people joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizer referring to catalysis.
A group of masked separatists, worked by the intervention police, touched it with eggs and threw ink in dust, creating dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There were also confrontations later, in which the police used batons to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independent groups who sang "Don't forget, we don't forgive" faced unionist protestors, who shouted "Long Life for Spain".
Fourteen people have received treatment of minor injuries suffered in protests, can be read in the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region inclined to independence, one year after the reference of 1 October which was considered illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
The electors chose the independence desperately, although the flow to the urns had been low, with a majority boycott of those against.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to block the current vote in votes spread by the region, resulting in violent confrontations.
The independent groups had camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
Although this event was performed, it was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year, we lived our best moments.
I have seen my parents cry with joy because they can vote, but now we are blocked," he said.
Although they have gained a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections in December, the Catalan independent parties have had difficulties maintaining the impact this year, with their most well-known leaders in voluntary exile or in waiting for judgment for their role in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who registered the police protest with his cell phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"He's becoming more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained for trial since last year, announced that he would apply to the European Parliament in the elections next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that we see on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after car attack against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car had been beaten repeatedly in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage occurred in the gates and in the building itself.
At a certain point, someone may also have shot a beast against the car.
Menga's attack gives a victory of 1-0 to Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone secured the victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, frightened the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of only two in 18 games as a tech at the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changes level, with the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team, which continues without a victory out of the house in the first division this season, faces Hearts leaders, with more than eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face at home the Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
However, Livingstone has expanded its six games to match without defeats in the division, with the main Holt coach without losing once since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against disturbed visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead in the marker long before the goal, because the incisive character of their game was causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but he let himself be dragged in front of the ball, and then Alan Lithgow managed only to direct his effort far after he had hesitated to find Craig Halkett's head on the ball.
The house team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of her, knowing that she could cause problems to the visitors in the ball games.
And it was that way that the crucial goal arose.
Rangers gave a free and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to pass to Menga, which gave a touch and scored from the center of the big area.
At this point, Rangers dominated the ball's possession, but faced a defense of the impenetrable house team, and Liam Kelly's network guard had no big problems.
This pattern continued in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the Rangers' network guard's feet, Allan McGregor, and Lithgov gave a long shot from another liveston ball game.
They continued to come across crossings to the great area of Livingstone, which were subsequently resolved, and two high-punitive claims, one after Halkett's investment on Glenn Middleton's replacement and the other after one hand, were rejected by the arbitrator.
Livingstone's Phenomenal Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, from BBC Scotland, on Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed the expectations in this upward path.
Your game style and staff have not changed since their return to the big teams, but it is necessary to commend Holt for the way in which he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossesal, achieving an extremely well-organised defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to give their maximum during the game.
Either way, Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality demonstrated by Gerrard at times, the team remained very close to these standards.
His final game was not inspired (only once they were able to open the house team), constituting a kind of warning to Rangers, which is the middle of the table.
Erdogan is received ambitiously in Colonia
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, whose objective was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The difference involved issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then addressed the Colony to open up a new and giant mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside its country.
The police have argued security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25 000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters have noted the presence in the emergency to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also became heard, condemning both the president's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisionist character of a visitor praised as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the Beswod Street crossing with Evelyn Street, a street moving in Deptford, on the west of the city, about 10 a.m., British summer time.
The driver stopped and a relief team intervened, but the cyclist died at the site.
This collision takes place months after the death of another cyclist in a collision with escape on the Children Street, about a mile and a half of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents are trying to identify the person and inform his family.
There were barriers and deviations to buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six agents injured in disorders
Six prison officers were injured in a high-security male prison, the Prison Office said.
The still ongoing disturbances began at the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 0930, British summer time on Saturday.
Special agents were called "Tornado" to solve the problem, which involves eight prisoners and is restricted to one wing.
Agents received treatment for small facial injuries at the site.
A spokesperson for the Prison Services stated: "Specially trained teams have been used to resolve the current incident at the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received treatment for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it must be made clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind the ranks."
The HMP Long Lartin accommodates more than 500 prisoners, among them some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, agents of the intervention police were called to resolve a serious disturbance in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Furacão Rosa threat Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the areas affected by drought can benefit)
It is rare for tropical depression to reach Arizona, but it is exactly what is planned for the beginning of next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa hurricane to cross the South-West Desert, involving the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flooding notices for Monday and Tuesday, for the south and east of Nevada, for the south of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is hoped that Rosa will take a direct tour of Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the end of Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix referred to a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression in a radius of 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the Furacone National Centre provide 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated quantities that can reach 15 mm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Bacia, will be able to receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of all isolated ones that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden flooding, the rain of the Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by the drought.
Although the floods are a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, because the southwest is currently affected by the drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, little more than 40% of Arizona suffers at least extreme drought, the second most serious category," the weather.com site reported.
First of all, the Rosa train will reach the continental mass through the peninsula of Baja California, in Mexico.
The Rosa, still with force of furakon on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected that it reaches the coastal area in Mexico with a tropical storm force in the afternoon or when it falls from the night of Monday.
Strong precipitation may occur in parts of Mexico, resulting in a significant risk of flooding.
"Total precipitations of 8 to 10 mm from the Baja California to the north-west of Sonora were expected, with a maximum of 25 mm possible," the weather.com site reported.
The Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the first hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then head south of Utah in the last hours of the night of Tuesday.
"The main expected danger of the Rosa or her rescue is the very high precipitation in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and in the South-West Desert of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to produce sudden and widespread floods of deserts, with life risk, and shelters in mountainous lands.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three male adolescents and one 20-year-old man were arrested for murder after a 16-year-old boy had been found with cutting gun injuries in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, close to 4h, British summer time on Saturday.
It was transported to the hospital, where it remains "stable".
During the night, a 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds, and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock area, were arrested, and Avon and Somerset police reported.
Agents have called on everyone who can have mobile videos of the event that they present.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "was the victim of evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the implodable and ultrasonic tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a comedy in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "was the victim of evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during its appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified to the Congress on Thursday, with a strong and emotionally disillusioned charge of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually abused her for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified in the hearing on his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed the brilliantism, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A vote of confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum," said a number of Western Virginia supporters.
The President later referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican affluence to the polls in the inter-chamber elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not competing, but I'm actually competing," he said.
"That's why I'm going all the way to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the democrats are in a mission of "resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, CNN said a main deputy of the Republican Party's leadership.
Hundreds of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves with up to six meters high beat on the beach late, dragging many to death and causing a trail of destruction on their way.
The tsunami occurred following a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the threat of tsunamis arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and they did not run away immediately, having been victims of the incident," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the agency to minimize the effect of Indonesia's catastrophes (BNPB) in a communication in Jacarta.
"The tsunami didn't move alone: it dragged cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastal line.
Some people scuttle the trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency show many destroyed buildings and stores, deformed and damaged bridges, and a mixed water.
The coastal city continued to be swept away by replicas on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in a statement that energy released by the huge Friday abatement was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb spread over Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, read in the statement.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had disappeared.
Several victims were found trapped under the ruins of the ruined buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage can be deeper along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, an area called Dongala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely incapacitated and there was no information" about Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were heading for affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it may worsen much more," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves had emerged at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film published on social networks, you can see a man on the top floor of a building shouting frenetic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, for people on the street below.
In a space of minutes, a water wall fell on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the filming.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive cut in energy that interrupted communications in the area of Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with Jacarta's help and other cities. However, the evacuations still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo made a visit to Palau's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia rises exponentially to more than 800.
It's too bad.
Although he managed to reach the city of Palu safely, where the staff are staying in shelters in the yard of his offices, the staff of the World Vision of Dongala went through devastating scenes on his way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's too bad.
Even when the aid groups began to start their dark task of assisting the victims of the disaster, some complained that the highly experienced workers of foreign aid were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and foreign personnel may only be available to the site if it is declared "national disaster zone".
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a level of provincial catastrophe," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"When the government says "OK, this is a national disaster" we can open doors to international assistance, but this status is not yet available."
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunamis of Friday, friends and relatives of the still missing ones still had the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that attenuated the dark spots of the natural catastrophes.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from a dump.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been arrested in the shed for two days next to the mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian national team of paragliding, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, completed at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were their students.
"As senior practicer of paragliding, I have to carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon said that, in the hours after the news of the breakdown of Hotel Roa Roa began to circulate among the paragliding community, he sent messages to whatsApp for the athletes in Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a grey check mark instead of a pair of blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves carry 26 750 USD during the automatic box recharge in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole 26 750 USD to an officer from Brink's who recharged an automatic box in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was evacuating an automatic box in the fun complex and preparing to introduce more money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, another man "runs behind the Brink's staff" and stole a bag of money that was intended for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Those who have information about their identities should contact the Newport police by number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper rename for Ye
The Kanye West rapper has changed his name--to Ye.
By announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "To be previously known by Kanye West".
West, 41 years old, received some Ye and used it as a title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before your participation in Saturday Night Live, where you are expected to present your new Yandhi album.
This intervention is intended to replace that of the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled it for "emotional reasons", informed the creator of the show.
At the same time as an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "tu"," said West at the beginning of this year, when he commented on the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So I am you, I am us, we are us.
Come from Kanye, which means "one", for only Ye - being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, of everything.
The album is another reflection of who we are."
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known alternately by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hiffen and maescules.
In Mexico, AMLO undertakes not to use military against civilians
The Mexican elected president Andres Manuel López Obador committed himself not to using the military force against civilians, at a time when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
López Worker promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have risen to 300, when left-wing student movements were deployed throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obador committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by granting them monthly grants to those studying and opening more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people to the gangs of criminals.
The United States should duplicate the financing of artificial intelligence
At a time when China is strengthening its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should duplicate the costs of research in this field, the investor and professional in the Kai-Fu Lee area, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
The comments take place after several U.S. government departments have made announcements related to IA, even though the country does not have a comprehensive formal strategy on the subject.
However, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead innovation in IA by 2030.
"Duplicate the IA research budget would be a good start, as all the other countries are so behind the United States and we are looking for the new revolution in IA," Lee said.
Duplicate funding can duplicate the chances of the next great success of the IA being achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent companies in IA in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated Othello's most well-classed American player. Later, he performed executive functions in Microsoft Research and was president of the Google branch in China.
Lee credited the previous U.S. government technological contests as the Robotics Challenge Agency of the Department of Defence for Advanced Research Projects and asked when it would be next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have a great deal of effort to obtain state funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's stealing academic leaders; it's companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired universities to work in IA.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the US to implement its efforts in the field of IA.
"I was of the opinion that green cards should be automatically granted to doctors in IA," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Artificial Intelligence of the Next Generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Sciences Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve partners in the industry and the academic environment, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month an investment of $2 billion in an initiative designated by AI Next.
With regard to the NSF, it currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in research in the field of IA.
However, the legislation of the United States, which was intended to establish a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, did not go forward months ago.
Macedonians vote on the change of country name
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on the change of the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked its requests for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that its neighbour's name in the north represents a complaint about his territory and vetoed his entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal for a new name, but the opposition nationalists argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population, mostly Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the flow to the polls would be sufficient to meet the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The rapporteur's question was: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying to continue the accession efforts in agencies with the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I come today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the reference is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament said that it would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Elections Committee stated that there had been no irregularity records until one afternoon.
However, the fluency was only 16% compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters appeared to vote.
"I voted for my children; our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a capital elector, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on the change of country name, which would open the doors for his accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who would boycott the referent.
"We are by NATO and the EU, but we want to stick with our heads up rather than the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to receive us as Macedonia, we can address others as China and Russia to become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that the entry into NATO will bring much needed investments to Macedonia, which will account for a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
According to him, a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required flow.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV from Macedonia found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote.
For the rapporteur's success, the fluency must be more than 50% more than one vote.
The failure of the rapporteur would represent the first major disaster in the policy of the pro-Western government since it took place in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero do Manchester City across the entire Brighton defense towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling forgot Brighton's defense in the 2-0 win against Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
I'll make it look ridiculously easy on your neck in a minute 65.
The Argentinian advanced got a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the game.
He made a sprint between three Brighton defenses before cutting to reach open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He filed a defense before neutralizing the race more than others within the limits of the great area of Brighton.
Then he took a walk to his left, where he was Sterling.
The advanced English used its first touch in the big area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right button, defeated the Brighton Mathew Ryan netguard with a finish to the right side of the network.
"Aguero's having some trouble at his feet," he told reporters Pep Guardiola, city coach.
"We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky for him to score a goal right now."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage against the Premier League.
That goal was marked at 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball right in Brighton's territory in that game.
He took a walk on the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before driving Sterling in the direction of the second train.
Sky Blues' advance dropped the ball to the network immediately before going off the border of the field.
The city faces the Hoffenheim in the group phase of the League of Champions at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make Rockies' life difficult
With the nations removed from the end, there were not many reasons to force another start.
However, the always competitive Scherzer has hopes to enter the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the Rockies at the end, which hold a leadership of a game about the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a victory of 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to ensure their title of the first division.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can go into the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Why would I not want to compete in these conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the launcher titled for Sunday, but there are those who say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to launch the launches in this situation.
Scherzer, who would perform his 34th beginning, held a session in the bullpen on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
Washington's right player goes 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump starts in West Virginia
The President later referred to the situation involving his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he mentioned the importance of republican influence in the intercalal elections.
"All we've done is in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the great, great... I'm not competing, but I'm competing, and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "They're seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical democrats, they're seeing it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power using all necessary means. Are they seeing evil, folly?
They don't care who they are, who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, have the mission of "resisting and obstructing".
"And they've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling it "aggressive, evil, dirty and lying" to the democrats.
The President referred to the name of Diane Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judicial Committee, having received public sounds.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you get away with the document?
Whoa, whoa, what?
No, um, no, I, wait, one - that was a very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party has ceased to be involved.
It is intolerant to those who openly give their opinion
When the activists of the Momentum of my local party organization voted to censor me, it wasn't a surprise to me.
At the end of the report, I am the most recent of a number of Members of Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our opinions.
My colleague in this House, Joan Ryan, was the target of similar treatment because he had resolvedly faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for discontinuing Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues in relation to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement to the Nottingham East Labour Meeting at the sixth fair mentioned that "we assume that the meetings are inclusive and productive".
During most of my eight years as a local worker representative in parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "more kind and kind" policy has been much forgotten, if it has ever been realized.
It has become increasingly apparent that the different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged whether or not it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because the colleagues with whom he thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect me to return and assume positions with which he would never agree - whether they were on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn't really matter what I say), there's a torrent of insults on the social networks that call for "reparation", denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I don't have to belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one who's going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments that I am directed tend to be political.
I am afraid of the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a barbarous set of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never return to them.
One of the most disillusioned aspects of this era of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have stopped being inclusive, and with each motion of "censorship" or change of the rules of selection the party narrows its views.
I have received numerous advice over the last two years, I urge myself to keep my head low, not to be so expressive, and so "it would be all right" for me.
But that's not what I came for.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, implicated by the neglect of the government of Thatcher who left the classroom of my school covering literally in trash, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as an author or as a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my policies, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country is headed for a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, not understanding the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for Nottingham's Momento; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "reparation" or political files will prevent me from acting in the sense that I believe it is the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the impatitable Ayr goes to the top
Two late tests sent the result somehow, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting game of Tennent's Premiership of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better management of the risks that the house team made the best, and coach Peter Murchie had all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "The merit goes to Ayr. They manage the risks better than we do."
Grant Anderson's trial at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr in the front, but a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, handed over to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to express the numbers, having taken advantage of an unconverted trial.
Climo extended the advantage of Ayr with a great penalty, before, immediately before mid-time, having marked and then converted a soil test to place the marker on 17-5 for Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose began the second part well and Patrick Anderson's test, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
There was a long interruption due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, which was transported from maca to the outside and, after the resumption, Ayr reinforced leadership with a trial by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr's current captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense pressure invested.
However, the house team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having destroyed Climo without the ball, in the launch of criminality, MacPherson placed the ball on the ground behind the evil in progress of Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately to follow the reincarnation, after Kyle Rowe had picked up David Armstrong's kickbox and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth trial of the house team.
Styl Game star ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, seems ready to enter the restaurant sector after knowing that a licensed restaurant company was appointed director.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, who writes and participates with the long-time comedian partner Greg Hemhill.
The couple announced that the ninth season, soon to star, will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is Director of Aföringmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was going to engage in the "flowerful business of the restoration of Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a land unspoiled from the coast, expects the court to take a path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a covered ship base of rope in La Paz.
Public buildings offer a blue-marine flag.
The ship bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazons bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Getting him back is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia, a land without coast, there is still the memory of a lost coastal line for Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be at the highest point in decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course it is a positive perspective on the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivarians will see the provision of the TIJ judgment in giant screens scattered by the country, hoping that the Hague court will act in favour of its country's claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile is forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election in the coming year, also has a lot to play in the judgment of Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", were the President's votes last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will act in favour of Bolivia, and that it would not change much even if it did.
The United Nations agency, based in the Netherlands, has no powers to assign Chilean territory to another country and has provided that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the TIJ's judgment is issued only six months after the final allegations are heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have damaged it.
"The issue of access to the sea was kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has lost some Chilean good-willed remnant, he suggested.
At a future time, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in Haia, rejected the idea that the court's decision process was infinitely fast.
The next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, another of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political crusade.
"Bolivia will never exceed its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to go beyond the past."
North Korea claims that there will be no disarmament without the country trusting in the US
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, said that his nation would never shed its nuclear weapons if he didn't trust Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfil the promises they made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of the rival countries.
Your comments arise when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to resume nuclear diplomacy in impasse, more than three months after Singapore's summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said that it is an impossible dream to consider that the continued sanctions and the objection of the United States to a declaration that puts an end to the Korean war will sometimes lead the North to settle down.
Washington was about to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are calling for a second summit.
However, there is a generalized cyticism about Pyongyang really intends to reduce an arsenal that the country is still probably the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang in the month that comes to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented in the passela a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which left the style set in Paris Fashion Week frightened.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very few practical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to pass it.
Valentino's most prominent piece was an extravagant bege hat decorated with a wide aba similar to a pain that flooded the head of the models.
Other top-sized accessories included jayed melons, a cotton hat and even a pineapple, although they have not been designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks... even at the time of the carnival.
Many of the colored masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with a high knife.
One of the creations resembled the diving equipment, with tubes and glasses, while the other looked like a frozen cone.
And if you want to continue this great statement of fashion, you're lucky.
The stylistic observers predict that these huge hats are on the way to a store near you.
The top-sized hats appear effervescent in the path of "La Bomba", the hat with a 61 cm abba that has been used by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand of worship behind the very little practical hat that spread through the social networks sent another great creation for the passersby: a beach bag almost as large as the model in fact of bathroom that transported it.
The hot orange strip bag, decorated with raffia strips and with a white leather stick, was the most prominent piece of the spring-summer collection La Riviera of 2019 by Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I am looking forward to seeing large hats and beach bags arrive at the shops for the next summer. Since the designer had so much impact, it would be difficult to ignore the search for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for global citizens
The independent schools in Scotland benefit from a course of academic excellence, with this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students scattered throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools intend to prepare their students for deepening their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a school curriculum to the extent, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after theme in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter his heart."
This quote reminds us that we cannot depend only on English when we intend to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year's recent examinations, we verify that the languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign languages achieved the maximum classification of A.
This data, collected in 74 schools under the age of SCIS, shows that 72% of students received the highest score of A in mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are favoring foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
The languages, as an option, are now addressed in the same way as the themes STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and not only.
A United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission survey in 2014 concluded that among the reasons for the difficulties faced by employers in filling gaps, 17% dealt with the lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities to demand language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with a skill for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person in front of competition.
According to a survey by YouGov to over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation, being French the only language spoken by a proportion of two digits, 15%.
Therefore, investing in language teaching is important for children today.
The field of various languages, particularly those in developing countries, will give children better chances of finding employment with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the United Kingdom for the 2020 horizon, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be a set of languages to choose in independent schools, supported by teaching staff specialized in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills necessary for success, whatever the future reserves them.
Today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this option with diversity and excellence for young Scottish people.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron starts at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is about to end for fans who want to see LeBron James start at Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Lakers coach, announced that James will participate in the pre-season opening game of Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes will play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Laker journalist Mike Trudell posted a tweet claiming that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was interrogated on his plans for the calendar of six Lakers games in the pre-time period.
"I don't need pre-time games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Time and channel of YouTube from Trump's start in West Virginia
President Donald Trump launches a campaign round tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five comics scheduled for next week, which include parking in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the pending vote of compliance for their election to the wave of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to strengthen the support for the interim elections to be held shortly, since the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's beginning in West Virginia tonight and how do you see him online?
The beginning of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, is marked for the 7th of the afternoon, East Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You will be able to see Trump's beginning in West Virginia online below in a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably address this week's hearings to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, who have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse.
However, the main goal of this torrent of comics is to help Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, to gain some momentum.
Thus, leaders of President Trump's campaign said that these five comedians next week intended to "give energy to volunteers and supporters at a time when the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they maintain in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so fundamental to the President's agenda that it will visit as many states as possible, as we approach the excitement of the campaign season," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign who resigned, told Reuters.
Marked for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the logo at night may attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and obtain coverage of the media in the Pittsburgh area", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, in disadvantage in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him help in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows that it has the strength to fight to keep the hope alive before Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, the Saturday afternoon forums may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of the impact is a completely invented sports concept, but it is one in which players truly believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where did they say the impotent will come now?
"They have an advantage of six points and now there are four, so we're dealing with this as a bit of a push, I would say," said Jordan Spieth while he was leaving the camp at the end of the day.
Europe is in advantage, of course, with four points forward and with more than twelve in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, still have some energy of reserve and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them achieved three points in four.
Speeth has been the killer of tea to the green and is leading by example.
Those party gutural screams were getting taller as the round continued, with a crucial putt that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His dick that won the game on the 15th produced a similar scream, of that guy who reveals he still believes that the American team continues in the competition.
"It is only necessary that we concentrate and worry about our own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left to each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Speeth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of Ryder Cup.
The European couple, impossible but adorable, is with four in four and cannot be mistaken.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and on the back nine on Sunday morning.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, the idea that they are the players fighting on Sundays is reinforced, and that there is no more popular player to seal a European victory potential for the sun in Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
By preference, both at the same time in different holes.
However, the talk on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs this morning, when he and Alex Noren were on the team.
A bogey and two doubles in the front of the nine have thrown Spanish and Swedish into a hole that they've never been close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see from close because of the interactions between partners, the advice that they give and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better in the team so far and has acquired a significant advantage on the final day. However, this foursome session has also shown that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe with a leadership of 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter on the last day of Ryder Cup with a marked advantage after leaving the fourballs and foursomes of the Saturday games with a leadership of 10-6 in front of the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari's inspired duet led the load with two victories on a Tiger Woods with difficulties to get to the Le Golf National classification, so far, four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, fighting to preserve the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning's fourballs, winning the 3-1 series.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes with two winnings, but failed to reduce the disadvantage.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points in Sunday's single day 12 to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points followed when he and Molinari, who received some "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the only duet to win four points in their four opening games in Ryder Cup's history.
Having smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they greatly consolidated the advantage, defeating a Woods powerless and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, which crashed during two games on Saturday, revealed occasional access to genius, but has already lost 19 of the games he fought in fourballs and foursomes, and seven followed.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson on the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third rankings in the world ranking.
However, on this pleasant day with a light breeze in southwest Paris, Europe has not always taken the best.
Jordan Spieth, winner for three times the main male tournaments, and Justin Thomas defined the reference to Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet won a brave 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain, and returned later to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4&3 in the fursoms, losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a team has invested a four-point disadvantage before the singles, although the Furyk team, the title holder, just needs to empatriate to preserve the trophy.
After two days in the second position, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "don't think" a unilateral untrustworthy disarmament
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was exacerbating the mistrust of the United States and that there was no way of the country unilaterally denying its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant good-will measures" last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear testing centre and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the USA," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way we will proceed to our first disarmament."
Although Ri has recycled North-Korean complaints already known about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as gradual steps were taken, its statements appear to be significant in so far as they do not deliberately reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast to the previous positions of Pyongyang.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump at the first summit held between a US president in operation and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim undertook to work in the sense of "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has sought to achieve a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States says Pyongyang has first left its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted appeals to mitigate the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first denuclearization" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive way, opposed to the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of people who don't know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of sanctions is exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been mentioned by US leaders in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the party concerned was South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse".
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly to guide North Korea's rockets towards the U.S. territory it was inevitable after "Mr. President Mau" Trump had called Kim "the man of the rockets" in a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which had threatened to "destruct completely" North Korea, has filled Kim with praise for his courage to take steps in the sense of disarmament, but has said that there was much still to be done and that the sanctions would have to continue until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Thursday, Trump said he did not have a calendar for this, saying that "to take two years, three years or five months, doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps he has taken.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue vigorously until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to stifle the financing of North Korea nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the side of the UN General Assembly and declared after visiting Pyongyang again in the month he came to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, although then North Korea had denounced him for "making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantle a missile installation and also a nuclear complex if the United States "takes appropriate measures".
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they sought were the security guarantees taken by Trump in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses that teach them to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to sleep more, an initiative to combat the machist culture of studying in "rights" impregnated with caffeine.
One professor concluded that students of this university at the top of the world ranking did not often have the slightest idea about the most basic concepts of care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believes to be the first of his type in the United States.
The inspiration for the course arose after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation in learning.
"In the end, a girl came to have me and said, "Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?"
The young man said that no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, served for the first time this year, explains to the students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said that the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course of one hour includes a series of interactive tasks.
In the section there is a picture of a bedroom where the students click on cafes, curtains, shoes and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by the lack of sleep, and the importance of a routine to pick up the bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risks of AVC, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that it won't change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, as we all have the right to know the effects on the health of the smoking option," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "direct action" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students make this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we sleep enough and quality should be a "secret weapon" of the students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid overcrowding, because the deprivation of sleep puts the brain in a hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
The course opened her eyes and inspired her to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, she said.
The next step, according to its expectations, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar study programme before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students weigh the use of an alarm for the time to go to bed, as well as wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can deregulate the circadian rhythm and lead the problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal destroys the men of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another access of sadness outside the house when the attack by Dolly Menga caused Steven Gerrard's unscrupulous team a 1-0 defeat at the Livingstone stage.
The Ibrox team was trying to record its first victory in its race from the 1-0 win in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team ended up in the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games, leaving its team eight points behind the unencumbered Hearts, leader of the first Scottish division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and the Rangers' collective, inexperienced of inspiration, never seemed to be equal.
With the Rangers now coming down to the sixth position, Livingstone goes up to the third, and just behind the Hibernian for the difference of goals.
And more problems may arise for Rangers after the Calum Spence line prosecutor has been treated with a head injury caused by an object apparently shot from the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that exceeded Ayr in the mid-finals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same eleven of Livingstone who stole a point to the Hearts last week, and will have been delighted with the way his well-known team smacked the opponents in each game.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingstone did more with what he had.
The team could have marked after two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's bag, but the average lost his big opportunity out.
A long free trip from Keaghan Jacobs went to meet Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow managed only to finish off in the direction of the second train.
Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have been granted a great penalty at the fourth hour with his collision with Steven Lawless, but Albert Steven Thomson refused the Colombian appeals.
The Rangers managed only two completions on the first part, but the old Ibrox Liam Kelly network had little to worry about with Lassana Coulibally's head finish and Ovie Ejaria's weak finish.
Although Livingston's goal at the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected of the development of the game, it is inexcusable that the team deserved it, no longer due to its tenacity.
Once again, Rangers failed to deal with a long stop ball game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher took a walk to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in the range, having replaced Coulibally by Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had an immediate impact when the advanced later came to Morelos, but impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the block.
However, Livingstone continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgov and Halkett to take a long walk behind a long pass.
Holt's team may have increased its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a great penalty when he got married in Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored the request.
German: Geiger's inventor
And now a page from our German "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and continues to CONTAR ...was born in Germany the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that ended up taking the device known as Geiger counter.
The main part of science since then, Count Geiger has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely vacuum scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals as a uranium.
When we put these auricules, we can even hear the effects of atoms released from radioactive activity in minerals."
Evans: "Look, now you're really shaking!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd anniversary.
But the invention he gave his name still persists.
New vaccine for cancer teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new vaccine for cancer teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its change in the laboratory
These cells, which can "see" a common protein to many cancers, are then injected again into the body
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a series of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her cancer in the ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its change in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to many cancers, designated by HER2. These cells are then injected again into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer", including those of the mother, the ovary, the lungs and also the colorretals, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach involves removing immune cells from patients and "teaching them" to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West boards a Trump support diet by turning a MAGA hat after its appearance in the SNL.
It didn't work out well.
Kanye West went to the studio on Saturday Night Live after an inconsistency in which he praised US President Donald Trump, claiming that he would apply to the presidential elections in 2020.
After performing his night song, with the name of Ghost Town, in which he enlisted a hat "Make America Great", he started a bravata against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white man and he says to me, 'How can you like Trump? He's racist!'
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have abandoned America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star broke the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been transmitted, the West Bravata scene was published in the social networks by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to change West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had gone through a bad mouth in the builders because of the hat.
"I was intimidated by the builders.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
I was scared!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the marginalization?", saying that "it was my superman's coat, because that means no one tells me what to do.
They're trying to love."
His comments provoked public noise and the participants in the SNL appeared to be embarrassed, he told Variety, having someone from the program said to the newspaper: "The whole study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with the execution of song I Love it discolored by Perrier bottle.
West received a demonstration of support from the director of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the tweet: "One of our bravest spirits: BRIDGE FOR ENFRENTING THE TURBA".
However, the interview programmer Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying that West was simply "to be what it is, and that is absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or by supporting his "art") who I believe to be welcoming and spreading harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And we too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, claiming that he was now "the former known by Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to be renamed, following Diddy's past, also known by Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg has already used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known by Prince".
Accusation of attempted murder after defamation in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man had been stabbed in a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
It is expected that the case will be brought before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be analysed by the public ministry.
Star of the Battle of the Thrones Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a scrimist like Jon Snow in the violent series of medieval fantasy of HBO, the Thrones War.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the Machist hero, claiming that such papers on the screen often make boys feel that they have to be hard to be respected.
In a conversation with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the Rose Leslie Thrones War, also at 31 years of age, admitted that he has a "very strong position" with regard to addressing the problem.
"I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they're growing up in terms of the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
And he went on, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that make young people feel they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big issues of our time: how can we change this?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young."
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequelities or sequels of the Thrones War when the series ended in the next summer, referring to him that the "fighting camps and horses" ended.
As of November, Kit will participate in a Republished True West of Sam Shepard, which is the story of a cinema producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believed that finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Thrones War.
"I met my wife in this series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from here on," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the loving interest of the character of Kit, Jon Snow, in the series of guaranteed fantasy with Emmys.
The couple gave the knot in June 2018 in the land of the Leslie family's property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual relations, which marks a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV has rapidly spread in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to practically zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was described in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against the LGBT community is frequent.
Studies have estimated that, due to the conservative values in the country, 70 to 90% of men who have had sexual relations with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases result from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters desperately flees information about Republican senators by a collaborator and attacks the "dangerous lies" and the "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information from three U.S. Senate members on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that the accusations were promoted by opinion leaders and "ultradright" sites.
"Treatable lies, lies and more lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information published allegedly includes the homes and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on the charges of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The information escape occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as the Gateway Pundit and the RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with the Waters office and published the data of a Waters staff member, The Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated charge is totally false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility in this leak of information.
This unsubstantiated charge is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticisms, including those of the former press secretary of the White House Ari Flescher.
"This mess is coleric," Flescher wrote.
"That suggests she doesn't have the temper to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something that is not your responsibility, he can't be angry.
You can't have a challenging position.
You can't question the accused's motives.
You have to reveal calm and serenity."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing to be too choleric during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will dispute the Waters place in the intercalary elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," she read on her tweet.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned "the competent authorities" of these fraudulent allegations.
"We ensure that the guilty will be revealed," he continued, "and will be legally responsible for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff."
Review by Johnny English Back to Attack - weak spying movie parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British flavor, and this seems to actually apply to the new edition in the series of comedy and action Johnny English, started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Regresso de Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satisfaction about being so bad is the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his unexplained eyes and an excessively elastic expression, obtained his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, more than anything, which is a comprehensive comic creation for non-anglophene filmers.
He is, of course, the idiot secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a soft glamorous, has a little of Cloiseau, a petite of Mr. Bean and something of that fulan who contributed with a single note to the theme of the film "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In addition, his character was originally based on the international traveler and mysterious man whose role Atkinson played in TV ads for Barclaycard, who left chaos on his track.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JJ.
I loved the scene in which Johnny English approached a helicopter holding a medieval armor, with the rotor's legs making a short noise of carriage against the hat.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is obvious, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that the "series" films like 007 and the Impossible Mission now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We are left with the idea that humor is directed to children and not adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English's bizarre disadvantages are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's shift film numbers in Bean's character.
Now, the assumption, always current, is that Britain is in a serious hurry.
A computer pirate infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground for consternation of the service agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who incarnates a pompous and conflictous figure, suffering already a total decal of political impoularity: Emma Thompson gives his best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give much material for large flights.
Your Secret Service Advisers inform you that, since all the agents in the asset have been committed, you will have to remove someone from the reform.
And that's the desperate Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a little school, but giving non-official lessons about how to be an infiltrated spy: there are some interesting numbers here, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "School of Rock".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and to reunite with your auxiliary Bough, a paper played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attached to a submarine commander, a fusing character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the catastrophe at His Majesty's Secret Service are back to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin, a paper played by Olga Kurylenko.
However, the prime minister is being severely harassed by the billionaire charismatics of technologies that claim to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sad Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their hate of absurd acts of desolation: dissembled by table employees, burned a visionary French restaurant, created the confusion penetrated as clandestines in the luxurious Volta yacht, and English launched pure anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the interior of the Volta house.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but for the most sympathetic and temperamental of all, the set has a lot of TV for children.
The result is quite medium.
And as in Johnny English's other films, I couldn't stop questioning: couldn't the British cinematographic industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
The workers say they're developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but getting five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be weighing a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day work week, but with five days paid.
Reports suggest that the party wants the patrons to pass the savings with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) for the workers, giving them a day of additional strike.
The workers got a three-day weekend, but keeping the order.
Sources refer to the idea of "adjusting" the party's economic programme, which redirects the country to the workers' interests.
The transition to a four-day work week obtained the favourable opinion of the Congress of Trade Unions as a form of workers taking part in economic change.
A high manager of the Workers' Party said to The Sunday Times: "We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It won't happen from one day to the other, but a four-day work week is a aspirations adapted to the party's approach to the rebalance of the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the overall strategy of the party to the industrial sector."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a four-day work week during its 2017 legislative election campaign.
However, this ambition is not currently favoured by the whole of the Labour Party.
One party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not part of the party's policy, and we are not considering it."
The shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party's conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover the power of the "no-faced directors" and the "speculators" of the basic services companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the total shareholding of current water companies, as the Labour Party may make 'deductions' on the basis of the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to place workers in company management councils and create inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the private company's share to employees, which can embody dividends annually that can go up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the "60 minutes" if the FBI's investigation to Kavanaugh can do them or not change ideas
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, raising questions as to whether the conclusions could lead Republican senators to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be conducted on Sunday, Scott Pelley's "60 Minutes" correspondent asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy proved more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"That's when I went to the hearing, he said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this claim came up, and I asked him, "Did you?"
He has been resolved, determined, without doubt."
Graham's vote, however, seems unpopular.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh and would require an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a very hard one," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything changing again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the city of New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive list of stars that will act on an equally impressive mission: eradicate poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people in the Grand Revaldo of Central Park, not only to attend the events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness of the real objective of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of defenses that hopes to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (at least if they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, a phone call or any other significant ways that contribute to raising awareness for the purpose of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of "clickivism" - do we find that it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who have put pressure on achieving a number of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, contributed to the announcement by world leaders of commitments and policies valued at over $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, with at least $10 billion related to them already disbursed or aggravated.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people scattered around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom, bringing together investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end sub-nutrition in the country. This after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, the donors, the national governments and the Global Citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of sub-nutrition a footnote to history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to a crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5000 pressure actions on the United Kingdom in terms of improving the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, the Power of Nutrition, which would cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the level of nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions from the site, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen answers: "It was a long and tortuous way - sometimes we fell and failed.
But like the great movements of civil and anti-apartheid rights that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
USA can use the Navy as a "block" to put an obstacle to the energy exports of Russia - Interior Secretary
"If necessary," Washington may use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed the US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that the involvement of Russia in Syria, in particular where the legitimate government is invited, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they intend to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the south-east of Europe," he said.
And according to the governor, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has the ability, with its Navy, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to block to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants in an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In his speech, he continued to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, suggesting that they are effectively the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to slow down and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "magic of a single trick" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements arise at a time when the Trump administration is in a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this purpose, the Trump administration authorities, including the president themselves, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inadequate" North Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has become a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stated that the North Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, intends to double the existing capacity for 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons, being an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," Russia's Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position motivated a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the German Industry Federation (BDI), appealed to the US to keep away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, chief of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will analyze deeply" the possibility of applying to the presidency in 2020, said Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he will "be an in-depth analysis" of the possibility of applying to the presidency to follow the intercalal elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would weigh the possibility of applying.
"It took time for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and this includes a woman as the highest responsible," The Hill said.
"After November 6th, I will thoroughly examine the possibility of applying for the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying that "he was taking the country in the wrong direction".
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been a harsh vocal critic of Trump and his appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "it is clear that we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a survey carried out on Thursday revealed that the majority of Warren's own constituents were not of the opinion that it should be applied to the presidency in 2020.
59% of the "probably" electors of Massachusetts said that the senator should not apply, according to the poll of the Political Research Centre at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
32% support your candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for a candidacy of the former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other prominent names of the Democratic Party discussed regarding a potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions the post-traumatic stress of Track Palin at the beginning of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence
"What my own son is going on, what's going on after he's back, I can identify with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds with which our soldiers actually come back," said the public of a show in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "return a little different, return hardened, re-examined whether there is this respect for why his comrades soldiers and aviators, and all the other members of the armed forces, gave it to the country".
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence on a woman and possession of weapons while alcoholized, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Department of the Police of Wasilla.
Eleven states and the District of Colombia support the new asylum policy
Eleven states and the District of Colombia are giving their support to a legal challenge of a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims who flee from gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district sent a friendly statement curiae (friends of the court) on Friday in Washington, in support of an asylum seeker who is responding to this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complaint in the Grace vs. Sessions process that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against politics was not revealed.
The person claimed that his partner "and his children, members of a violent gang", abused her, but the US authorities rejected his asylum application on 20 July.
The complaint was arrested in Texas.
The government ministries supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States, such as nations facing generalized problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Resources Council allowing immigrants without documents of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia Karl Racine stated, in a statement on Friday, that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle," it reads in the statement of friends curiae.
The lawyers also argued in this statement that the ban on immigration police affects the US economy negatively, stating that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "available the necessary labour".
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims who were fleeing from domestic violence and walking in June.
"The asylum is available to those who abandon their country because of persecution or fear based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion," Sessions said in their policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day throughout the world.
Rescue efforts desperate in Palu when the number of dead doubles in a counter-hour to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother of a febrile baby of male sex, comforting him in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water."
Residents were warned that they would return to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find among their water-supposed parts.
There were hundreds of wounded and the hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who broke the ribs and shoulder, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where the patients were treated outside due to the strong replicas they continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears when he reported what he felt when the violent earthquake hit him in the hotel room of the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then, silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "advertising ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a US daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, referred last Thursday to China Daily's payment supplement at Des Moines Register, the most outgoing newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 elections to the Congress, an accusation made by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked the beginning of what the US authorities, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in the growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently making an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides apply tariff gaps on imports from the other.
China's relativity rates at the initial stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support the Republican Trump Party, Chinese and US specialists said.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged workers, farmers and American companies.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is now putting foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertising ads in our free press".
"With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the established American tradition of freedom of expression and press publishing a payment notice in the Des Moines Register," Branstad said.
"In contrast, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissident voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of opinions that the Chinese may have of the country's worrying economic trajectory, because the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not mention which.
Republicans alienate women's voters before intercalal elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warns analysts
At a time when many important Republicans support and defend the appointment to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various charges of sexual assault, analysts have warned that this may lead to a negative reaction, particularly of women, during the short-term elections.
The emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to move forward for a vote.
These things have no backlog," said The Hill Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher stated that he doubted that the last hour's pressure on Senator Jeff Flake (Republic of Arizona) to carry out an FBI investigation would be sufficient to silence the rebels.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November," said on Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and National Speaker of the Progressive Group MoveOn, according to the Washington newspaper D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors sang "November is at the door!" when they appeared in the Senate's courtroom, given that the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee chose to advance with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat all the memories," said the news site Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst without a party affiliate.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among the indecisive voters in the suburban areas and the younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public witness describing his allegations of sexual assault against the appointed Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans made progress with the confirmation.
"This has become a trap for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, or about if Kavanaugh will take his place as a judge. It's also about how the Republicans dealt with the issue and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps to elect democrats, to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about whom to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41% of respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% claimed they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% claimed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or absolutely in his testimony, while only 30% claimed the same about Ford.
After the Flake proposal, the FBI initiated an investigation into Ford's allegations as well as another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford referred under oath to the Senate Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually harassed her while alcoholized, when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the appointment to the Supreme Court exposed its genital organs when the two attended a party during the period during which they both studied in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor intends to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest design of this legendary character of technology, Inrupt, is a company that takes part in the Berners-Lee open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention underlying the Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own online personal data storage, or POD.
This can contain contact lists, to-dos, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a browser and at the same time.
What is unique about online personal data storage is that it is exclusively for the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through the data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
At the beginning of this week, the world-wide technology creators will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to the "Facebook and Google about the introduction or not of a total change in which all your business models are turned from one day's notice to the other.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a publication in the Media on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic with this next era of the Web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Honor the clergyman decorated with Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergy of the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during the First Great War was honored in their home city for 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann got the decoration on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellengliese and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a French actress four days later and never knew he had received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren set off a memorial plate at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "excellently symbolic" that the plate had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that he gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Coronel Vann led his battle on the crossing of the Saint-Quentin Canal "no very thick snow and under closed fire of portable and machine guns".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage", led the line forward before attacking only one cannon and killing three soldiers of the show.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German French actress on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know he would never be able to equalize, but also a lesson of humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the stop, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the stand" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is to be demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people".
Fans of mixed martial arts all night to see the Bellator 206 watch instead of the Porca Peppa
Imagine this: You wake up all night to see the Bellator 206, full of stars and in the end, you are prevented from seeing the main event.
The San José series included 13 matches, with six of the main groups, and was being shown live during the night in the United Kingdom, Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the spectators in the United Kingdom were frightened when the cover changed to Porca Peppa.
Some were not impressed after they had been agreed to until morning especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change for animated designs for children as "a kind of bad taste joke".
"The regulation of the government says that the content is not suitable for the six in the morning, so they had to switch to another programming," said Dave Schwartz, administrator of the marketing and communications portfolio when questioned about the transmission.
"Peppa Porca," yes.
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said that it will re-establish the schedule of transmissions to include future visitors to the United Kingdom.
"I think that when I think about the repetition, I think we can solve the problem," Coker said.
"But there are six Sunday mornings there and we will not be able to solve it until our Sunday time, which is a second fair in British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that, when the programming changed, there were many messages exchanged and none very nice.
We're trying to solve the problem, and we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about his sexuality
Olympic dancer Tom Daley said he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he got into high school that "no one is like me."
In an interview with the first Desert Island Disks of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was in favour of the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a father made him less concerned with winning the Olympic Games.
The program’s long-term regular presenter, Kirsty Young, took a few months’ break due to the disease.
Looking like a couple in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "lower" to everyone else because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
In his words, "to this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that has given me the power and strength to achieve success".
Their goal was to prove that it was "someone," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to appeal to more countries to describe homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The world's trifle said to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "he caught me by surprise".
Daley married Oscar's winner last year, 20 years older, although he said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When we go through when we are so young" - his first participation in the Olympic Games was at 14 years of age and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through high and low similar.
The couple had a son last year in June, called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, everything that mattered was "to win a gold medal," he said.
There are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
Your son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011, 40 years after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had the tickets for the London games in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you that "you're not going to be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and got a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of a multitude of compatriots in the Olympic Games ... there was no better feeling," he said.
All this was also the inspiration of his first choice of song - Proud, by Heather Small - with which he had been identified during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Disks takes place on BBC Radio 4 at 11.15 a.m. on Sunday, British summer time.
Mickelson down in the bank at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will strike a record on Saturday when fighting his 47th game on a Ryder Cup, but he will have to recover his way to prevent the frame from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing at the biennial event for the 12th time, a record of participation, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk in the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as many times it has been in the United States teams, the five-time winner of the main male championships divided the day between the role of support and work in their field in the hope of restoring what afflicts him.
Having never given touch of the most challenges even in the height of your career, the 48-year-old player is not ideal for the Le Golf National field, where the long rough usually punishes the wrong touch.
And if the field by itself wasn't quite frightening enough, Mikkelson, on Sunday's ninth, will face the exact British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who teamed up with beginner Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four games they fought this week.
If Americans, with a four-point disadvantage to start the 12 single games, register a good start, Mikkelson's game can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he couldn't say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a palm tree on my back, placed his arm around me and said it would be soon tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a respected champion who gave these teams a lot last week, and also this week.
I probably didn't have to see him playing two games.
I thought more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we'd have to keep going.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else."
Mikkelson will pass over Nick Faldo's record on Sunday of the biggest number of games in Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of a career in Ryder Cup that has never equaled the successes of your individual career.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven empathies, although Fury has said that his presence has created some countless advantages for the team.
"He's sarcastic, funny and spiritual, he likes to play with people and he's a great person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players have had fun dating him also this week, which was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage can disappear in an apex
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows by experience that his leadership in the last day of singles at Ryder Cup can easily become an accident.
The Danish had his star at the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the nose with the narrowest of the margins, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We always try to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little by little," said Bjorn, in the image, after attending the 2018 Cup victory for 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, to lead for 10-5 in Le Golf National.
So the story has shown me and all those who are in this team that this has not yet ended.
Tomorrow, give your best.
Go over there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the approach should remain.
I have always said I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of who is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted with the performance of their players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never join myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters is individual performances and this involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we're there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested at the most.
This is the message you need to convey to players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they're going to leave the partner and he has to go and give the best of himself too."
In contrast with Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek that his players have a better performance individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
The Furyk himself was already on both sides of these great revolutions on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before ending to lose when Europe took out the "Milagre in Medina" from the cartel.
"I remember all the words," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get that fast start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medina.
When this impulse is directed towards one side, the pressure is very large in these parts of the middle.
We organized our team accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, we're going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counter-attack, confronts Rory McIlroy in the main game, being Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Puller the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players for this order because I think it covers the entire route," Bjorn said about his choices for the singles.
New German warship once more delayed
The most recent wreckage of the German Navy should have entered the service in 2014 to replace warships of the time of the Cold War. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to accidents and an exponential growth cost, according to local means of communication.
The entrance to the service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the command ship of the new baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the worrying post-delivery problems have undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Navy had ordered in 2007 will serve to replace the broken old Bremen class.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-shipships, as well as some furtive technologies such as the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenances, which would allow the most recent missions to be sent to missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the late continuums have made it possible that with the last-generation warships, considered as a form of Germany designing power beyond borders, they will already be dissatisfied when they enter service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made munches last year when the German Navy refused to put it in service, having returned it to the Blohm & Voss stables in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
It is little known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cites a series of critical "hardware and software defects" that would make the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 mariners, only half of the required quota in the oldest Bremen class fractures.
It was also known that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the marine capacity to install additional features in the future.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons has the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to hardware failures, the total project price, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion, an increase in the initially budgeted 2.2 billion.
The problems affecting the most recent fractures have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy is currently leaving ships capable of being used."
The politician said that the problem had grown exponentially over time, because older ships were placed outside service without ships to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg fractures could have joined the Navy.
National Trust spys the secret life of the morgues
New investigations are being carried out in a property in the Scottish Highlands with the aim of revealing how the pieces use the landscape to look for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common pieces and fruit, as well as long ears and Daubenton pieces in the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations spread by the property to follow the activities of the pieces along the station.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS personnel and volunteers with portable detectors.
The analysis by experts of all recordings will evaluate the frequency of the calls of the pieces and what each species is doing.
A map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of its behaviour on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, consultant for the conservation of the nature of the NTS, expects the results to reveal which areas of the most important habitat for the bites and how the same are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to ensure the maintenance of forests for bats and associated species.
The population of pieces in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect the bedrooms and reduce habitat.
The wind turbines and the lamps are also a threat, together with the moss paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, the pieces are not blind.
However, given your night hunting habits, your ears are more useful than your eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
It is used by them a sophisticated eco location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes the pieces very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who perform regular studies, dormitories and sometimes rescues.
It also created the first reservation in Scotland dedicated exclusively to the pieces, in the property Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish pieces.
The owner, David Thompson, says the same is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrave we have an excellent area for pieces," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many old trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still much about the pieces we do not know, so the work we are doing here and in other properties will help us to know more about what they need to flourish."
It stressed the importance of checking whether there are pieces before maintaining the properties, because the non-intended destruction of only one maternity bedroom can lead to the death of up to 400 young women and animals, which could eradicate the whole of the local population.
The bites are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, sit them down, disturb them or destroy their bedrooms.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish maintainer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our pieces, and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are vinging."
Ronaldo desperately charges of rape when his lawyers prepare to process German newspaper
Christian Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to promote themselves" using their name.
Your lawyers are preparing to process the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The advance of the Portuguese and Juventus selection was charged with violating an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that then I will pay $375 000 for the alleged victim to remain silent about the accident, read in Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram at its 142 million followers hours after the disclosure of the allegations, Ronaldo, aged 33, characterized the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," he told the chamber the winner of five Golden Balls.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to process Der Spiegel on the allegations, which have characterized as "an unacceptable report of suspects in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would require compensation for moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident will take place in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga will have reportedly gone to the player's room, where he will have violated it annually, according to the documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo lay down his knees after the alleged incident and told him it was "99%" "a good guy", damaged by "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she addressed the police and had photos of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to enter an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "feared by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "being humiliated publicly".
The woman, who is 34 years old, now claims that she intends to cancel the agreement, because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Royal Madrid, leaving Manchester United at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve in a business of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will regret it forever" to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent forever" if it lost its world leader status in the car factory after Brexit, said the Secretary for the Greg Clark Companies.
Clark also said that Toyota in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of delays on borders in the case of a Brexit without agreement could lead to loss of jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, which produces the Auris and Avensis models in Toyota, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My perspective is that if Britain accidentally leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed concerns about the EU's exit without an agreement on the level of operation of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, said that it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is managed on a "just-in-time" basis, with the pieces coming every 37 minutes, from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU, for cars manufactured by order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day stock in its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production would stop.
Clark said that Theresa May's "Checkers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "suitably calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We have to have an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the benefit of this opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4 today program.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to continue with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Although it was not possible to estimate the time to stop, Toyota said that in the long term, the increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and could lead to the loss of jobs sooner or later.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the factory in Burnaston for 24 years and coordinates the United Union trade union in that place, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never return again.
A government spokesman said that "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "adjourned another week" given that there is still no understanding of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, referred to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's advisers and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump could be preparing the resignation of the Deputy Attorney-General, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of discontinuing conversations with Trump and the possibility of depositing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, having information that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, which was held in the United Nations, in New York.
Trump said that "I would prefer not to fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then delayed to avoid the overlap with a hearing by the Senate Justice Commission in which they testified to Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation with a week's duration on the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press consultant, Sarah Sanders, participated in Fox News Sunday.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been marked, it may be this week, but it may also be delayed for another week, given all that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see, I always like keeping the press informed."
Some journalists would not agree with this statement: Sanders has not organized a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences is not due to a deviation from the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said: "Do not disagree with the fact that they like protagonism."
He then realized that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President has more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, adding, without adding evidence: "We have analysed these numbers."
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has an opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is infinitely better than to talk to me.
We have often tried to do so and have seen that we have done so in the last few weeks, and the fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
The press conferences on the ground are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way in front of the journalists present.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers in the Scottish National Health Service on the fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and request that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months from the EU's UK exit.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to paying applications for the status of EU citizens working in decentralized public services in the country.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, and decisions are expected for this autumn.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this moment how much I value the contribution of each official, regardless of his nationality.
The colleagues from all over the EU and other sources bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to continue here much."
Christion Abercrombie submitted to emergency surgery after having had head injuries
The Tennessee State Tigers' defense, Christian Abercrombie, was submitted to an emergency surgery after having had head injuries on Saturday for 31-27 in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ, told the Tigers.
The coach of the Tennessee team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
"She approached the sideline and almost declined," Reed reported.
The technical team and medical staff placed Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before laying it in a monkey and transporting it to a deeper assessment.
A team representative told Chris Harris of the Nashville WSMV, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/gravity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when this happened.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended the studies during the first season with Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five flags on Saturday before leaving the game, which raises his entire season to 18 labels.
A higher stamp tax will be charged to foreign buyers when acquiring properties in the United Kingdom
The Conservative Party announced plans to charge a higher stamp tax to foreign buyers who acquired properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to the homeless
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract the youngest electorate
The increase in stamp tax will affect buyers who are not taxed in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp tax will be charged to foreign buyers who have acquired properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to the homeless, today Theresa May will announce.
The measure is addressed as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's campaign's success to attract the youngest electorate, with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and to charge higher incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will affect people and companies who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to boost the government's campaign to offer a roof to the homeless.
The surplus - added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second rooms and purchases for rent - may rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the measure will allow up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new constructions in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, making prices rise and making it difficult for first-house buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "phantom cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers that spend most of the time away from the country.
The new policy emerges weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a cut of the stamp tax to help young people acquire their first residence.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining the prices of the high properties by loading land that they do not use, demanding that Mrs. May leave the quotas on the accessible rooms to resolve the "damage of accommodation" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an appealing set of proposals for housing reform, including income controls and the end of "without justification".
He also wants to assign extended powers to municipalities for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: "In the past year, I said that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for every new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not true that it is so easy to buy a house for people living outside the United Kingdom and for foreign companies as for British resident workers.
For too many people the dream of being the owner of your house has become too far away and the shame of those who sleep on the slowly continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland's coach Jack Ross said his "last ambition" is coming to become Scotland's electorate.
The 42-year-old Scottish has been successful in the challenge of giving a new life to the North-East club, which is currently third in the First League, to three points of leadership.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on his return to the Scottish First Division in the past.
"May represent my country as a player.
But I just got an internationalization B," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound program.
"I grew to see Scotland playing in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if you have success in the management of clubs."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's coach include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he did not feel afraid of the names so consecrated in such a large-scale club, after rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town invitations.
"For me, at the moment the success is summed up as "can I take the club back to the Premier League?"
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to take the club back, but I'll just think I've done well here when I reach that goal."
Ross's career as a coach is only three years old, after a period as an assistant coach of Dumbarton and 15 months in the hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the decline to the third division and took St. Mirren from the threat of depromotion to the championship title in the following time.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he once felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Considering Alloa "was a real cross," he recalls.
"I've always seen myself more in the coach's role than the player's.
It seems strange because it went well, I won life as a player, and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and load pressures, but I feel very good as a coach.
I always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than ever I felt during my adult life."

The perfect time for a painting is 17:30 a.m. on Saturday, according to a study
The heat wave of the summer filled the British pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
The restaurant groups recorded a 2.7% growth in July sales, but the occupation of the restaurants declined 4.8%, showing the statistics.
Peter Martin, CGA consultant, who compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of good time and England's career in the Football World Championship, longer than expected, made the pattern of June, in which the pubs recorded a growth of 2.8% in sales, would repeat in July, but the restaurants met a reunion.
The fall of 1.8% recorded in the sales of the restaurant in June was worse in July.
Pubs and bars with the business absent in the drinks have far had the best performance, with a homologous growth more than they paid off the downfall of the restaurants.
Pubs with business absent in the meals also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the restoration operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars managed directly, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6% during the month, with the meals falling back by 3%."
Paul Newman, of the analyst of the laser sectors and RSM restoration, said: "These results extend the trend we have recorded since the end of April.
Meteorology and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors that influence the sales of the food market outside the home.
It is not surprising that the recovery groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is particularly harmful when it comes to the extension of the cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not reach the worst time for the operators with the business absent in the meals. Only time will tell if the worst temperatures we know in August will provide such relief."
The growth of the total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the brand launch banning.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator of sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes the performance data of 47 operating groups, with a combined business volume of more than 9 billion pounds, being recognized as the benchmark of the sector.
One in every five children hidden from their parents secret accounts on social networks
One in every five children - some with only 11 years of age - has secret accounts in the social networks that hide parents and teachers, has revealed a study
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "false" pages in Instagram
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "principal" account to show their parents
One in every five children - some with only 11 years of age - creates accounts on the social networks that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in "false" accounts on the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students claimed to have an innocent "principal" account to show their parents, while having private accounts at the same time.
A mother who found the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter discovered that the teenager was encouraging others to "violate her."
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools, revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which he admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Council
Elid Doyle was elected Non-Executive Director of the Scottish Athletic Council at the annual General Assembly of the Regulator.
Doyle is the most successful Scottish athlete. President Ian Beattie described the nomination as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilid is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and global community of athletics and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have much to gain with their presence in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be able to act like the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to contribute really to helping to guide sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 and 400 metres in the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, stopped walking after a transient ischemic accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: "Do today a month that suffers from a stroke.
I stopped walking.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could recover and to what point.
It has been a painful job, but I achieve a total recovery, I resume walking and even do exercises of agility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Announcement of milk extraction pump compares mothers to cows, dividing opinions online
A dairy extraction bomb company divided the opinions online with an ad comparing mothers who breast-feed cows in order.
To mark the launch of what is described as the "first silent portable milk extraction bomb", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic announcement inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom granted by the new milk pump to mothers who extract milk.
Four mothers dance in a full-time feno-song-song of music that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm ordering, but I'm not safe" and "If you haven't repaired, I don't have tits, these are my breasts."
The refroner continues: "Bomb, bomb, baby food, bomb, bomb, I'm ordering my kids."
However, the ad published on the company's Facebook page generated online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, with many saying that it alleviates the "horrors" of the Latin industry.
"You have decided to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen to them a few days after they were born," one viewer wrote.
The Elvie extraction pump is discreetly contained within a breast-feeding medium (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Comprehensively traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why don't you use them to announce an extraction bomb for mothers who can stay with their babies?"
Someone said, "An announcement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad, like a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarant".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a crazy little bit, but it makes all sense.
This product is great," wrote one of the women.
Another commented: "It is a fun ad directed to mothers who extract milk (many times in bathrooms or in the workplace) and feel like "vacs".
It is not an announcement to commend or judge the Latin industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the Sutians.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie bomb is completely silent, has no wires or pipes and head discreetly within a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, take their babies and even leave home while they extract milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of "Mother", commented: "The Elvie Bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between women who extract milk and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while we presented in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible feeling of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was shot.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the passerelle for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children displaced discreetly for camping at the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has reached a peak, although the monthly crossings of the border have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the severe rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to meet.
Traditionally, most of the "fathers" are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own ability to stay in the country by offering themselves to a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential patterns and other adult members of their family aggregates should register their fingerprints, being the data shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Alfândegas Immigration and Control Service, testified to the Congress that the service held dozens of people who applied for minors who were not accompanied.
The service subsequently confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
"About 80% of the parents or members of their family members are illegal in the country, many of them being foreigners with criminal records.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," Mr Albence said.
In order to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month from the date of detention, instead of 60 days, the previous rule, according to the officials of the reception centres.
Many are present for videoconference, not in person, to defend their application for legal status before a judge of the immigration court.
Those considered to be eligible for aid shall be promptly deported.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which may lead to access to violence or attempts to escape, according to the staff of the reception centres and reports produced by the system in recent months.
The rights defenders of immigrants say that these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as those of Tornillo, where the large dimension contributes to the neglect of children.
They add that the transfer of children to camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to get rid of friends exacerbates the trauma that many are already discussing.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal from the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also requested the return of Syrian refugees to the home, despite the war in the country in his eighth year.
Mouleem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally in the Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they will "be treated as such".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that has left millions of displaced.
He said that Damascus would continue to "make this sacred battle until we free all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "all and any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country devastated by war.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spare irrational fears" that led refugees to stay abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in the last major Idlib rebel base created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by the Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement established "clear places" and expressed hope that the military action aimed at the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, would "be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moulem laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Because Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the challenge and scandals will soon end their presidency.
In that I would no doubt constitute "the most final drama of a presidency of all time"!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue from the spectators.
Since 2014, senior hearings have doubled by 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled by 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in good time, a rise of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the cable hearings with up to 3.5 million spectators on the big news nights.
"This is a strong call for people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Designed Survivor" program on a cabinet chief who becomes President after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veterinarian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another theory.
Remember when you called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him he was going to vote Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
The chaos has value of entertainment.
Of course, unlike television programs, Washington's stories can determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to the family meeting of immigrants and the health of the global economy.
Switching from program is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can give.
And yet, it is more than being an informed citizen when we are attending a six-hour debate by experts on the use by Bob Woodward of sources "with deep knowledge" in his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15 000-dollar leather blouse ("a piece of clothing full of insomnia", as Washington Post said) and the implications of stormy Daniels'... um... President Trump's anatomy.
For my part, I'll never face Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he's done looks like a reality show because he gives us something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", on Trump's dynamic list and the daily rounds of the circle (antagonise with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
We can't lose any episode or stay back.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was closed at home, seeing MSNBC while recording CNN.
He did not detract from television while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to witness to the Senate Justice Commission, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said: this is the principle of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but at last they were right."

Significant external financing in the intercal elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania Circle has a flow of funding, thanks to a realisation of the electoral circles that left two holders in the race for the same place.
The recent adjustment of Pittsburgh's suburban circles put the Democratic Conor Lamb in the race, which won its place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb applies to another holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which is largely superior to the new 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had decided in January that the former circles would unconstitutionally favor the Republicans.
The race for the 17th round triggered a difficult dispute over the financing of the campaign between the main parties' financial arms, the Democratic Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the extremely controversial extraordinary March elections for the 18th electoral circle of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This place was occupied more than a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump won 20 percentage points in the circle.
Analysts have attributed a slight advantage to democrats.
USA thought to penalize El Salvador for supporting China, then retreating
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests in Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization from the management.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to call the leaders of North American diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after the "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, a spokesperson of the Department of State, in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received approximately US$ 140 million in 2017, including for control of drug trafficking, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial assistance and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high rates of unemployment and homicides.
With the continuation of internal meetings, North and Central American representatives held a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials of the Administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, putting aside all and any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has arranged an intervention at the conference, now marked for mid-October, in a sign of the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three U.S. representatives discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any hard messages or punishments from Washington.
The spokesperson of the White House for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about the internal deliberations to the coverage of the anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst near the Administration, who also requested the anonymity.
Study the History
The next bomb to be released may be the report of legal counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, which currently has substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will be allegedly guiding his investigation in order to determine whether Trump's campaign has conspired with Russia in order to attack the elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face responsibility by that body, while preparing to present himself again to the electors and perhaps to be judged by their parents.
They are many hypotheses and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - not even his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, a few German officials were prepared to deposit Hitler in a coup, since the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We talked and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnificin that followed.
The course of history revolves around points of inflection like this, in which the inexorable march of democracy is speeded up or slowed down.
The Americans are currently facing several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested to secretly record the President, speculating on his inability to perform the task.
Rosenstein says The Times news is wrong.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court, despite the credible charges of sexual abuse and dishonest witnesses?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress responsible for Mr Trump?
If we dump these tests, democracy will be about to go through a long desert.
But I believe we're not going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that in time occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to set sails from Sabath on that table with suastics.
With a legacy of these, how could he not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Optimist Rangers before the game with the Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers receive the Rapid of Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive empathy in Spain with the Villareal at the beginning of the month, will leave them in a good position to qualify in the G Group of the League of Europe.
A injury in the knee prevented middle Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the time until the empatt to two goals with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers will be able to use this result as a trampolim for higher flights.
"It was a good point for us because Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We found the game with a positive mentality and we won a point.
Perhaps we could have gained close to the end, but in global terms, the impact was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first part, but we turned around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game, but, with the support of the public, I am sure we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
Last year was very hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training runs well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past and achieve success."
Women are losing sleep with fear of this rescue-reform account
Although participants in the survey have a clear idea of the type of care they intend to take, few people have talked to their family about the matter.
About half of the individuals questioned in the Nationalwide study referred to talking to their respective spouses about the cost of continued care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to the children about the same subject.
"People want a family to take care of themselves, but they're not having this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Branch.
That's how it starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your family to care if you do not let them know your desires with proper background.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Includes your financial consultant: Your consultant may also help you find a way to pay these expenses.
Their continuing care financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary valuation to help cover these costs or funding using their own savings, provided that they have these available values.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Name a health care investigator, choosing a person of your trust to supervise your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes in case you are prevented from communicating them.
Consider the establishment of a search for your finances.
You will have to select someone you trust to make the financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suffers from a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you like to answer the questions about medication and allergies?
Includes this information in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only are financial issues at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is medication?
Who'll take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan."
Men targeted multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was hit several times with an air pressure when he returned home after one night in the city.
The victim, in the house of the forty years, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when it was reached in the chest, in the abdomen and in the hand.
The agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "advantage act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries do not involve life risk and the police have asked for witnesses.
Systems and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities said, and were expected to increase the number of deaths.
With the interrupted communications, the rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a region located more than 300 km from the coast, in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with administrative status below one province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also important in the province, but mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Fire Ring, being regularly hit by Sismos.
Here are some of the main sixsomes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in the north of Sumatra, originated a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong sixsomes reached the western coast of Sumatra, at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Island, along Sumatra.
2006: A 6,8 magnitude earthquake hit the south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, originating in a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of Mentawai islands along Sumatra, disposing of a tsunami with waves up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among the people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
This time no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died buried under the ruins of the buildings.
2018: Great Sismos hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The Sismos destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of aggression.
Palin, 29-year-old resident in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested by suspects of domestic violence, interference in an investigation on domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he picked up his phone.
Palin was previously detained in the pre-trial detention centre of Mat-Su, subject to a $500 loan, informed KTUU.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously innocent," the station reported.
Palin faces charges for three Class A crimes, which means he can be sentenced to a penalty of up to a year and fined at $250,000.
It was also charged with a class B offence, punishable with a day of chains and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges against Palin are filed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being brought before the Alasca Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of arms under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.

Sism and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died following a earthquake that hit Sulawesi's Indonesian island on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks were cut off, hoping that the number of dead will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the Sulawesi Central region, northeastern Indonesia's capital, Jacarta.
They circulate videos on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public ministry rarely seeks capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York
The New York Public Ministry seeks the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to execute an attack in October, a cycle in West Side Highway, in the Manhattan Bay, finding pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and "intendedly" inflicted serious injuries, according to the notification requesting the death penalty, registered in the South of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight charges of murder to the service of organized crime, normally used by the Public Ministry in cases of organised crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded a "considerable planning and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed it as "atrocious, cruel and devious".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", refers to the notification.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago the South Zone of New York did not ask the death penalty for an accusation.
Reu, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the penalty was commuted to a permanent prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit spying for the Soviet Union, two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court's documentation, Saipov, natural of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months that followed the attack.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charge.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He declared himself innocent in relation to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense lawyers, said they were "evidently disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for eternal imprisonment, without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Conservatory Congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians were supposed to " feel the pressure" of the Euro peans, while one of Theresa May's members suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Vice-Chairman Peter Bone said in Birmingham's demonstration that the United Kingdom would "be gone" if Farage was the minister of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to reconcile her deeply divided corridors was underlined by the conservatives who advocated the permanence, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has debated to maintain his commitment plan, known as the Chequers Plan, against the attacks of Brexit's supporters, the defenders of life and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing the Euro-Cetitics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said at the beginning of the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he intended to "end the Plan".
Bone suggested that Farage's responsibilities should have been assigned to the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have already left," he said.
Mr Wellingborough added, "I will continue to defend Brexit, but we should end the Plan."
Strengthening its opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone rejected the allegations that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their ideas and intend to stay is completely out of reach".
Brexit defender Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstration, claiming to journalists: "I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, is imppopulate in our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the street and to whom we owe our election.
Let the Chequers Plan fall and start listening."
In a message to Mrs May, she added: "Only the prime ministers who know how to keep the promises keep their jobs."
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should " feel the pressure" if they rush to bring the decision out of the 2016 referendum.
"This has become a matter of trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them they're not going to get rid of it."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want them to pressure our political class, who is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that has given us the victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud United Kingdom and self-government."
However, the defenders of residence marched to Birmingham before organizing a two-hour start in the city center.
A crowd of activists pushed bands with the message "Conservators against Brexit" after the group was released this weekend.
The representative of the Workers in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with the party's application at the opening of the congress.
"It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for 'Canada more', for the non-arthritis border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he concluded.
Warren's plan to "seriously put" any candidacy to the President
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says that he will "put the presidential candidacy seriously" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about their future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a usual critic of President Donald Trump, is candidate for the re-election in November against Republikano Geoff Diehl, co-mandate of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that you will be able to face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of debate since Trump took possession.
One of the participants asked him if he was planning to apply for the Presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to correct the problems of our government and that includes a woman in the top place.
Detention under the murder of Wayde Sims of LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the case of the LSU Tigers basketball player's murder, Wayde Sims, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the 20-year-old Detention of Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
The police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the images.
Yes, 20 years old, he was shot near the campus at Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims took a shot at the head, followed by his dying," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was targeted by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to his presence at the site, pushing a weapon, recognizing having targeted Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without showing resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police team.
Yes, a 1.98-metre junior created in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and was titled for 10 times in the past, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoverys per game.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the time that Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders in Mercedes played a central role in the race.
Leaving the pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind in defending his position on the first two curves, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the boxes and made Hamilton have to face the traffic of the end of the platoon, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxes one time later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton passed it after a renegotiated scarf, after which Ferrari's pilot repeatedly left the inside of the free track, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in the seventh place at the end of the first time, on the day of his 21st anniversary.
He then led a large part of the race, changing very late tires, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, aiming to cross over Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He ended up coming to the boxes on the 44th round but failed to improve his pace in the last eight rounds, which allowed Raikkonen to end up in a room.
"It's a hard day because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real knight, letting me pass it.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Third body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein in a comedy on Saturday because of his insistence that he would not have revealed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
Speaking on a commission in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Commission, commenting instead of what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "more, more evil and false".
"See the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate in the last days, see the anger, see how people are more, evil and false," Trump said.
"When we see the leaks of information and the communicators and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, running away from you?
Remember the answer to her... has she published the document?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't leave me.'
Well, let's wait.
The escape departed from us... no, it wasn't us," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape took place in early September, but he denied that the escape had left his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to be confidential, and I obeyed her request."
But his discontent did not convince the President, who commented during the beginning of Saturday night: "You know what, that was a bad body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the appointment of the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in his favour.
"They are determined to regain power using all means.
We see evil, evil, no interest in who can reach, who have to walk to assume power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat by Belfast Giants for 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals by Giants versus Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered from the defeat on Friday in the game of the First Division against the Belfast Giants, winning the second hand for 5-3 on Saturday, in Dundee.
The Giants got an initial advantage of two goals with Patrick Dwyer's and Francis Beauvillier's finishes.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie went to the house team before Dwyer put the Giants in front again.
François Bouchard came to Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald guarantee the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had achieved a turning on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee by 2-1.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, having the Giants won the three previous games.
Dwyer's first goal arose in the fourth minute (3:35) following a Kendall McFaul's assistance, with David Rutherford to attend Beauvillier to increase the advantage four minutes later.
In the first frenzy, Sullivan again placed the team of the house in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided Cownie's empathy at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants arrived at the first stage in the leadership, marking their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The team of the house reorganized and Bouchard recaptured with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, guaranteeing victory by marking the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, received Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Aerial controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has been hailed as a hero after dying to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers is safely landing.
More than 800 people died and many continue to disappear after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, originating in a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to attack the region, leaving many residents buried in the trash in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had fled to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his seat while the control tower was invading violence at the airport of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri, in Palu.
It was kept focused to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was then on the track, landed safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower, in front of the prominent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for the Indonesian air navigation agency, Yohannes Sirat, said the decision could save hundreds of lives, announced the Australian TV chain ABC News.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"We were devastated with this news," he added.
However, the authorities feared that the number of deaths could reach thousands, referring to the disaster management agency in the country that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, since there are many bodies buried by the debris that we have not yet been able to rescue," said the spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral takes place on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting help and maintenance to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute they get ambulances with bodies.
There's no drinking water.
The minimers are being pillaged all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, responsible for the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to the CNN: "The Red Cross is in a race against time to help survivors, but we do not know what we will find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces on the spot and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations. Are they ready?"
At the beginning of this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by six men who killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports that there is a man missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The air carrier responsible for the plane that exploded in a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a man missing after having reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely rescued from the plane to sink.
In a statement, Air Niugini stated that, from Saturday to Saturday, he could not confirm the parade of a male passenger.
The area company has claimed to be collaborating with hospitals, researchers and local authorities to locate man.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local vessels helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane had landed in the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline has advanced that six passengers remain hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
We still do not know what was the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in saying that the plane failed to reach the track and amorred in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was off the track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was very low.
"That was the best thing that happened," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other people had managed to drag themselves with the water through the belt and get to the emergency exits of the plane to sink.
He said that the boat attendants had panicked and started shouting, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, the mariners who were working on an improvement of a mill in the vicinity also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable ship to transport people to the ground before the plane sinking at 30 metres (100 feet) of depth.
Based on data collected by Aviation Safety Network, in the last two decades, 111 people died in accidents with PNG registered airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the night events in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the phone records to reconstruct the movements of the 20-year-old Quintom Tellis argument, and the 19-year-old Jessica Chamber victim on the night of her death.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several phones that confirm that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had made earlier.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in his car that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the car was in Nashville."
Another incongruity in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
Telephone records indicated that they only met a week ago.
Rowlett said that, some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis turned off SMS messages, calls and contact information from Chambers on his cell phone.
"He caught her from her life," Hale said.
The defence should begin to present its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would start to be analyzed by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trick wants to change the negative tone of the gender by filling your music with positive messages.
The High Breed Group of Bristol states that the hip hop has deviated from its roots of political and social criticism.
They want to return to these roots and return the popularity to the conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Commons have attended a recent renaissance in the United Kingdom thanks to the intervention of other interpreters, such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
Love of New York married process by dismissal through a "racist" SMS message
A New York lady is processing a marriage for discriminatory dismissal after she has received a mother's text message of complaint that "it was more black".
The couple denied the charges of racism, claiming that the process was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, showed some fear when she discovered that her new girlfriend Giselle Maurice was black when she presented herself for her first day of work in 2016.
"I CAN'T THINK... NO MORE PRETA," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the message to his husband, he sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when it was perceived from its gaffe, a Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice claiming the wrong performance of the previous African-American love and was waiting for a Filipino love.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day of work and sent to Uber's house.
Now, Giselle Maurice is processing the couple and asking for compensation of $350/day for the period of six months for which she had been chosen without contract.
"I want to show them that they cannot be punished," the Post said on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple rejected the allegations of racism, saying that dismissing Giselle was perfectly logical given that they were afraid they could not trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent you something that I didn't really want to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco told Post.
"Would your children trust someone who had treated you badly?
Your newborn son?
I don't believe it."
In appeal to the process of "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had been a mother only two months ago and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
"Are they going to pursue someone like that?
It's not very nice," the investment bank added.
While the legal process is taking place, the court of public opinion was jealous of condemning the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals that the editors of Paddington were afraid that readers could not identify themselves with a speaking bear
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented the letter: "It's hard to get into someone's skin who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know this now, after Paddington's been so successful."
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a little bear to write the children's book, would not have taken his chest if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60-year-old anniversary of the publication had a cheerful taste for his death last year.
About Paddington, who described as "a very important member of our family," said the father was very proud of the success achieved.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to gabarolic," he said.
"But as Paddington was so real to him, it was like he had a successful son: we were proud even when the fact is not ours.
I think it was the way he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to give up on the phone.
Soon after landing, the girl had been taken by emergency to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"No one used to call to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that she had to fire me from her.
That's what I did.
He said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
Soon we'll be together.
Together.
The medicines that the doctors had given you to keep the heart working were slowly giving up and getting out of your system.
He had died a while ago and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or complain because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to count."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now in mourning for her daughter's loss, boarded the plane along with other passengers allied to prove why she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I've always cut my head off.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a tremendous compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women of mourning lay cards on bridges to avoid suicides
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide struggle to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed cards on a galley bridge with motivation messages and phone numbers that people can use to get support.
Tyler, the son of Sharon Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want no father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Sharon Davis, 45-year-old resident in Lydney, said the son was a promising boss with a contagional smile.
"He was known for his smile.
They all said I was lighting the room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he had "mirbled in the darkness".
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible impact."
Sharon Davis created the posters "to know that there are people who are available to help and with whom they can talk, not even a friend.
Don't close yourself, you have to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, a long-term friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, his 15-year-old companion, shortly after his mother-in-law's death.
"I didn't say I was sad or depressed," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, it was a trap. When the kids opened the presents, they didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something you have to overcome: "Distorte a family.
Nobody's indifferent.
But we all have to keep on living and fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake with the start of the FBI investigation
"I thought that in terms like what I was asking for - a research with a defined time and scope - we could be more united," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, fearing that the committee would be "demonstrated" against a rooted party impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Its repulsibility is just a temporary issue.
The interim elections are only five weeks away. On 6 November, if the Republicans are expected to have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the frustrated Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met Ashley, Bush's personal secretary at that time.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not true that Kavanaugh is able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to cast the vote of resignation and confirm his seat in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean deserters decreased during Kim's regime
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean deserters for North Korea has decreased since the rise to the power of Kim Jong-one seven years ago.
Byeong-seug Park indicated that 1127 deserts occurred last year compared to 2706 of 2011.
Park said that the more stringent border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers from people asked for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang didn't make any public statements.
General rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean deserters.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority flee from China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strongly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers the deserters to be illegal and non-refugeed migrants, and it is frequent to repatriate them.
The relationship between North Korea and South Korea (technically still in war) has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that are in an impasse.
The talks took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general, to cooperate in the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Ministers, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the U.S. for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, a minority leader in the House, said that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterical and temporarily unfit to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted like this, she would be called hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all sexual abuse links to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made an emotional opening statement, sometimes in a loud and soluble voice, speaking of his family and years of high school.
He also explicitly accused the Committee's Democrats, invoking the allegations made against him of "a murder of a grotesque and conspiracy character" organized by liberals by Hillary Clinton having lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that the witness of Kavanaugh proves that he has no conditions to serve in the Supreme Court because of his preconceived behaviour against the Democrats.
"I think he has dequalified himself with his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When he was asked whether he would try to challenge the effective appointment of Kavanaugh and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you do not meet the conditions to be in the Supreme Court, nor even to serve in your current court," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge in the Court of Justice of the Circumstance of D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he received potential opinions from Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act (more known by Obamacare) or the Roe vs Wade case, given the fame of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions about the possibility of adjourning certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not a time to choose someone hysterical and preconceived for the Supreme Court and to expect us to be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women must be able to control their emotions.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury to cross, and cannot escape without crying.
"We were singing when we cried," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"Don't I think it's weird, don't you think?"
A woman with an executive position in a company has helped me tremendously. She told me that she also cried when she was angry, but had created a technique. When she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And he kept going.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant.", Mrs. Steinem went on.
The tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misunderstood.
I remember perfectly that, in an old job in a office dominated by men in which he was crying inexplicable anger, being grabbed by an older woman's neck - an unfriendly manager that frightened me a little - and literally dragged to the stairs to hear it say
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're gonna be happy because they got to affect you."
Patricia Schroeder, on the day of the Democratic Congress of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his candidacy with the presidents.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extra-marriage relationship on board a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not apply herself to the presidents.
"It wasn't a very thoughty decision," he said laughing 30 years later.
"Now there were seven other candidates and another was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who called the situation of "The Snow White and the Seven Years."
In view of its late entry, the fundraising was now desirable and he swore that he would only enter the race if he managed to raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He discovered that some of his sympathies gave him only 250 dollars, although they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not enter a formal campaign, the emotions came up - gratitude for the people who had supported it, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fund-raising and making the message reach voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism - and tears arose.
"Even it seemed that she was depressed," recalled Patricia Schroeder when he spoke of the reaction of the media.
"I'd have thought Kleinex was my business sponsor.
What would you write in my epitaph now?
"She cried?"
How the trade war between the U.S. and China can be beneficial to Beijing
The first rescue of the trade war between the US and China was absurd, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, in the perspective of the specialists, the removal of the two countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning in the beginning of the year when he taxed important Chinese imports including solar, steel and aluminium panels.
This week it was a stage of a significant deterioration in the situation with the new rates to affect goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), taxing in reality half of all goods sent by China to the United States.
Pequim always retaliated in the same currency, rising recently the rates from 5 to 10 per cent for American goods at the value of $60 billion.
China has committed itself to following the U.S. steps and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will be vacillated in the coming days.
Making Washington back would mean meeting the demands, but showing a public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its trunks, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the US can sustain China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"In fact, the fact that Washington or Beijing's interim political decision can result in an economic crisis in both countries is much more dangerous than observers could have anticipated," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to Asia's study at the Center for New American Security, a reflection group.
Minister for Foreign Affairs states that Syria is prepared for the return of refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help for the reconstruction of a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moulem, said that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily life and livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have stayed in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime would receive a good deal of help for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the revolt.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The selection of Europe beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National around Paris, France.
The U.S. has now accumulated six consecutive defeats in European soil since the last time they defeated Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is returning victorious after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reaches the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The North American star Phil Mickelson, who proved to have serious difficulties during almost all the tournament, took the tea off to the water at the hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined on all its rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 for the worst-class player in the selection of Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's most well-classed player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 for Ian Poulter of England where he may have been his last participation in Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most prized European of all tournaments with 25.5 points of career.
"It's not my habit to cry, but today I couldn't contain myself.
It was a difficult year.
I can't stop thanking Thomas for choosing and believing me.
I'm so happy that we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I am happy to have been able to help," said an emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
Pass the word to his compatriot Jon Rham who defeated the legend of the North American golf, Tiger Woods, for 2&1 in singulars on Sunday.
"It is impossible to describe the pride that I feel because of defeating Tiger Woods. I grew to see him play," Rahm, 23 years old, said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record at Ryder Cup.
Intubated statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 great titles won and only hit by Jack Nicklus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-calibre performance throughout the tournament, the remaining elements of the U.S. Selection were debated by reaching the fairway.
The U.S. captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after the disappointing performance of his team. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we were able to put some fear in Europe.
Let's fight.
My congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All your 12 players were excellent.
We are going to reorganize ourselves and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I like many of these 12 players and I'm proud to be your captain.
I have to take the hat off to the other team.
They were better."
