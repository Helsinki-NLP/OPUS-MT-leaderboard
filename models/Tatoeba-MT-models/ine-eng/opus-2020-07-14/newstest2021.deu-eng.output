Mamming: Corona-mass infection: 174 harvesters planted
After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and must not leave the holding.
A security service shall monitor the exit ban.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positively on the Corona Erreger Sars-CoV-2, as reported by the Dingolfing-Landau Land Board on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we must take this step to protect the population," said the Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Seven employees had already been infected in the operation before - this was the occasion of the census.
The farm is a large vegetable garden, strawberries, barley, coal and red beet - but the gourmets are only for depositary readers.
Mamming is a rural community with a population of 3300 people not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW work.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "After our information it is a closed circle of persons".
The court has been separated from non-infectious employees, the site is now surrounded by a barrier.
Greens and SPDs gave the government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions proposed to the Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet to neglect the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be worse if such local infectious events occur and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
This is similar to the SPD: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof Mid-May we have already requested a special control programme for farms with crop aid," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"The health conditions at work and living conditions must be strictly controlled from our perspective.
This is obviously not happening."
The outbreak was "with ansage".
Aidenbachstraße U-Bahnhof: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-olds fall to Schubser's bed

There was no danger through an invading train.
As the police reported, there were disputes between the two of them again.
The 17-year-old escaped from the tator, but his staff could be found in the afterlife.
With his father, he went to police inspection 29.

Report: Seehofer insists on longer advance data storage
Pre-recorded data storage is currently being suspended.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended pre-recorded data storage after a media report - instead of the planned ten weeks a year.
As the "Picture on Sunday" reports, Seehofer asked Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter about a rapid change of law.
It is therefore intended to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He considered it meaningful to "make the necessary adjustments in the law already," the newspaper quoted from the letter.
The pre-recorded data storage is currently being suspended.
A decision by the EuGH is expected.
But seehofer already wants the amendments to be applied immediately after a possible positive decision, that is to say in the report.
One speaker of the Ministry of Justice said the newspaper said that it was only reasonable to examine whether legal adjustments were necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the domestic ministers of the countries, had already spoken of a pre-recorded data storage in June.
NBA: Stripclub Åger for Clippers-Star Lou Williams
Exciting at the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball profi of the Los Angeles Clippers, is supposed to leave the tournament neighborhood in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a review.
According to U.S. news, he visited the "Magic City" strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who should have given the visit according to ESPN data, is again in isolation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for these waves.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (a different strip club in Atlanta, Dr. R.) have the best waves in the city".
NBA-Insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday at Twitter that NBA Williams has arranged a ten-day quarantine.
This way the Clippers star misses the first two official parties after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finals starting at night on Friday.
Söder expresses himself after mass infection to the Corona location
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) already announced on Sunday a tefofensive for large farms.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the Dingolfing-Landau district has frightened authorities and politicians.
At the large vegetable farm, almost 500 farmers from several countries are currently working, over a third have been infected with the Corona Erreger.
The court is currently under quarantine and is closed with a construction site.
No one can leave the land, food is supplied.
The good 3300 inhabitants of the municipality now offer free Corona tests.
Since the farmers had little contact with the local population, the Land Council has so far assumed that the infection did not spread beyond the court.
"Wisdom bisse": Explanation of the moderate firefight of Nantes
"My mandate has been cooperative," said counsel Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defendant added: "He greatly regrets the deeds, the confession was a release to him."
His mandate is "obtained by consciousness and is very involved in the extent of destruction".
In the case of a conviction, the man is threatened by ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged last Saturday at a fire.
The fire was broken out in three distant places in the church.
Laboratory investigations undermined the suspicion of fire foundation.
The suspect now arrested had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man worked as a volunteer for the diocese Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the night before the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent entry into the church, he quickly went to the scene of the assassin.
Discussion on the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that we consider the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"The German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates facts," said the "Picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the associations that can be dangerous to the former Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work at all: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate is not about whether it is forbidden to join organizations that want to break into this phalanx to facilitate the involvement of investors."
However, he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations prohibited in the Federal League by the 50+1 rule.
"There remains a legal risk of attracting the Bundesliga economic location in a European internal market," Grindel said.
The former DFB-Chief sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competition balance in the federal league, ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top-clubs at European level, but do not cause too much tension in the championship".
Even a equal distribution of TV money will not produce a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already huge among the first three associations.
The other 15 associations have an average budget of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"There have been people who have noticed this mistake and passed through the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said about the adoption of a expensive watch that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
"I've already been very busy with this."
He received the gift in the value of around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I have committed a violation of compliance, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
"With the ominous watch gift, I've gone completely transparent and madly.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He never made a "helm out of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naive, in any case this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": injured and a dead
The protests against police violence in the United States have reinvigorated the use of federal police in several cities by Donald Trumps.
On Saturday, there were clashes between demonstrators and policemen in different cities.
In Louisville, three people were injured, 16 people were arrested in Seattle.

As the police reported, one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was taken to the hospital.
In addition, there was also a window in a courtroom and a fire was put in place, as the police reported.
Investigations were carried out.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historic Costumes Trotzen Corona
Although the great Sause in Kurstadt was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the large parties in the city were missing, the people's masses and program heights such as Saale, Rakoczy ball or solid suit were burned, many of them were at their expense in the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we've managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair," Kurd Director Sylvie Thormann says.
The guests would have taken it well.
In principle, you return to the beginnings of the Rakoczy Festival, and only the historians stood in the focus of the festival.
Satisfying atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting with her husband for more than 25 years at the Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen.
The same is true this time in the Corona year.
The couple enjoyed the Luitpold Casino, watched the historics in the flange and heard the Cuban live music at the game bank restaurant.
"I also find it so pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She misses the masses that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But for this you miss the usual program highlights, all ahead of the hall burn on Friday night, as well as the historic dress and the final fireworks on Sunday night.
"It's already bad.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy-Ritturnier to take place again
In part, the alternative programme meant more work for the representatives of the historical Kurgs.
For example, Christina Gold, who is involved in a normal year at the party and is there to see on the corner of the Kurgartencafe.
This year she was traveling on Saturday and Sunday in Kostüm on foot in the city.
"That's more exciting, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The rider association had less to do, even though individual riders in the park were on their way.
"We very much hope that the riderquadrel will be able to take place again next year," says President Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of pause, 2021 would also have a Rakoczy riding tournament again.

Radprofi Tony Martin: Career continuation possible
Time travel specialist Tony Martin thinks about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can fully imagine continuing his career in cycling.
"I am just putting down the framework conditions with the team, how and in what form it could go on," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.

Argentina rejects the offer of creditors
The new requirements could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires informed on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," said one opinion.
"While 50 percent of children live in Argentina in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer relevant to the current conditions.
That is why Argentina asks its private creditors to refuse part of their claims of around $66 billion (about €59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country will again be threatened by the State.
It would be the ninth payout in the Argentine history.
In the past, the creditors had demanded higher interest rates on State bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
The Argentine Government, however, remains firm in its last offer and is not prepared for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a difficult financial and economic crisis.
The last inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts estimate a decrease in economic power by about 10 percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not made interest payments in the amount of US$503 million and was therefore made in a limited payment discount.
Professional arrival - not yet private
"It's going great" - this is Dr. Stefanie Kramer drawing after her first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end, everything went very fast: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer found out that she was going to be the successor of Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelder Notariat.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the promoted lawyer took up the work that the normal daily business takes on full tours for a long time.
"In private, however, I still have to get there," she explains in the conversation with the Rotaller advert and laughs.
The short period of time has not, of course, been able to reduce Regensburg's food point completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolingerin.
At present, she and her husband, who is a judge in Regensburg, are looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband has been able to apply for a short parental period to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 111⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to spend every day from Regensburg, they sometimes also have an opportunity to spend the night with their parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39th.
Grown up in the neighborhood of neighboring countries, you are of course a concept for a long time.
When visiting the site with her family in the past months, she recently found: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
More than that, she was pleased that she had made the race in the selection process around the free place.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career, her home Niederbayern plays a central role: after the Jura-Studium in Passau she completed her reference period and the second state exam in Regensburg.
After several stations as notarassessesorin, including in Rehau and Court in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in the Lower Gäu and Regensburg - during this time she also buried the promotion in labour law - in 2012 she entered her first position as notary in Rotthalmünster in the Passau district.
In 2016 she went in parental time, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notaries.
When the post in Eggenfelde was written out because of the close rest of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for the full professional re-entry, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the Notariatstation, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and at the same time has a praise for the staff of the office: "It's going great!"
The fact that she is able to leave her place on the scene here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
In the case of children's garden and crippling sites, she has already contacted a local facility.
And hits everything she wants, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here too soon - and meet the most beautiful jogging trails of the root valley.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled with 20 percent for the start of the season in the case of a fan-back.
"Because of the distance regime that is mandatory, we plan to maintain at present with 12,000 to 15,000 viewers," said Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer the "day mirror".
Usually, the arena in the river city at the Bundesliga games is a little more than 81,000 spectators.
In the spirit games caused by the Corona pandemic last season, the BVB per party lost about four million euros.
The BVB responsible for marketing, digitalisation and internationalisation hopes that, in addition to the normal sighting sites, some of the approximately 4,000 places in the hospital area can be reopened: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues are completely removed."
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, all are "well advised to take a stable side length for the first time".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are alone in short work in Germany, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer said.
The Dortmund Marketing-Chief praised the BVB profile for its pay drop, which should contribute to the overcoming of the crisis: "Of course, players know that its pay drop has a different effect than when we put 100 people working in marketing."
Twenty Wonders: Early start in life with a few hundred grams
Hardly harder than a packer butter, just once three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 fruits that are cared for annually at the Grazer Children's Clinic.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme light weights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early that neither lungs, intestines, or muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so dull that they could damage the electrodes of an EKG.
And they're so tiny that they wear occasionally doll clothes and especially mini-winters made for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be with voice - "and how," smunzelt Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the Whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theatre in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage just before the start of the holiday was the 9th class of the Sankt-Jakbus Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd.
Artist Julia Sylvester from the theatre of the city of Aalen presented the students with the production "The Home Dress" - and even by video.
Following this, the students and students via Skype were able to exchange with the actor and director Winfried Tobias about the piece and performance.
The idea of the implementation format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the expansion of the teaching.
Even if all the participants agreed at the conclusion that the direct meeting in the theatre and stage room would offer additional travel, the theater also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the gaming operation," stressed Director Winfried Tobias.
First round: the TSV 1860 would meet in the DFB Pokal on Entrach Frankfurt
If the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB pool, the lions meet at Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the discharge on Sunday.

The lions would meet with a successful qualification at the entrance of Frankfurt.
This resulted in the release on Sunday evening at the ARD sports show.

There the lions meet either at the Würzburger Kickers or Victoria Ashcherenburg.
If the Würzburg secondary climber reached the finish, sixty would already be qualified for the first round in the DFB pool.
Otherwise, the Giesinger had to carry out in the final game against Regionalligist Ashchenburg.
The first round of the DFB Pocal will be held between September 11th and 14th and a week before the third start.

In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the main role of "To Each His Own".
The film was released in Germany under the title "Motherheart".
Three years later the award came as the best actor in William Wyler's "The Heirness" (The Erbin).
She was also awarded a lot of recognition as a neurotic eccentrician in "The Dark Mirror" and "The snake grave".
In 1952, Daphne du Maurier proposed her main role in filming her novel "My cousin Rachel".
The piece became a global success.
With her long-term friend, Bette Davis, she played in "Wage song for a body".
From the marriage with the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953), the son of Benjamin emerged.
In Paris de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage is broken, too.
Sounds about an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
Road to Timmendorf: Beachvolleyball: Skip Tole/Wickler Finals at Comeback
The WM Second Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the finals at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the Top Teams in Düsseldorf, they presented their national teammates Nils Ehlers and Lars flights with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Last year, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.
In the final game at the Rhein, their relations with the Ehlers/Flights against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde had a defeat with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Beach in early September: the tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz design confirmed by AFD - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AFD is, in the view of the FDP, only a "feeing sheet" and does not change the character of the party.
"AfD is the parliamentary arm of the legal extremities in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only a part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AFD," said the FDP Home Politician Benjamin Strasser of the News Agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of negotiations, the Federal Court of Justice of the AFD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which was decided by the Federal Board in May by majority.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AFD Group in Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AFD were really going to remove law extremists consistently from their party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his followers would have been excluded for the longest time," said Strasser.
"There is, however, no political will in the AFD because the legal extremism is currently part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "This Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and changes nothing," he said the "World on Sunday".
"It speaks more of bonds than many frenetic supporters still have a legal extremist in the middle of the AFD."
Blume assumes that in the future, the AFD will be re-elected under five percent in elections.
"The days of AfD in Parliament are numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmans of the currently officially dissolved "flights" around the Thuringian president of the AfD and Group Björn Höcke; the protection of the Constitution undermines the breach as a "secured right-wing attempt".
In May, the AfD-Bundeschut Kalbitz was expelled from the party.
As a reason, Kalbitz did not state his party's earlier membership in the currently prohibited legal "Heimatreueen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans.
Kalbitz contests membership in HDJ.
Also, the president of the Left Group in Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, stressed that the decision of the Federal Court of Justice does not change anything in the character of AFD: "The Wolf has only shrunk cride.
The AFD remains a right-wing party, whether with or without calbitz".
Neither will the Federal Party be weakened by this decision nor by the right wing.
"The management of the Meuthen group is transparent.
A further observation is to be taken through the protection of the Constitution and is trying to get through the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not leave the spirits who called her.
There is no change in a draft," said Brandenburger SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn in Kalbitz.
"Here the AFD and the Group have been held as their right leader."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AFD will continue.
This announced on Saturday, he will now proceed in civil law against the decision of the Federal Court of Justice.
North Sea Windparks deliver good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea have eaten electricity in the first six months of the year 11,51 Terawatt hours.
These are well 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet shared in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea current to mainland and the transmission through the German power grid.
The windfalls on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet’s network area, have consumed another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind current from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea comes to 13,73 TWh, compared to good 11,64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The windmill on the sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany; these are about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind parks provide higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is made in addition to the wind ratios of higher production capacities, as in the last 12 months new wind parks have gone online.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at the same time with full force, they could generate 6.7 gigawatt power.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; it is based on Tennet at 7.1 gigawatt.
By 2030 it will rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands we invest up to 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections," said Tennet businessman Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind parks can also not exploit their capacity on lakes, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2 when the North Sea Windparks generated more than six gigawatt power.
On average, the North Sea windmills produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt power, corresponding to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the art gallery.
That was almost a little anniversary celebration to 130.
Birthday of the Kunstvereins Gmünder: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold exploded the usual frame after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual pursued the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Art Association, Professor Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent delivered the band "Defenders of the Universe" to the southern cornhouse.
In the north of the gallery, the association "sandtogether" engaged.
Free: Windbergfest rejected for Corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people visited this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and - in consciousness, how difficult it is for the participants - hoped for until the last minute," said Uwe Rumberg (partios).
"But finally, we are responsible here as organizers for the health of many thousands of people."
For if tens of thousands of people had flocked to the mainland and to the mainland, minimum conditions, hygiene rules and a follow-up to contact could not be complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not be much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring burden would increase disproportionately over a number of times.
Rumberg was voting for next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary, including the winter festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of the Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressur-Olympiasierin Werth not to beat in Achilles
Achleiten - The six-time Olympicist Isabel Werth was the outstanding rider at the dress-up tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four wins at the weekend.
After she had won a Grand Prix each for the occasion with Weihigold and Quantaz, she was also not to be beaten on Sunday at the Grand Prix Special and in the choir.

Also in the church was the German on Saturday on Quantaz clear before her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werths Siegerpferd Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful hairdresser in the world is to establish the ten-year hanging in the Grand Prix.
For Quanta, it was the first cow at all.
At the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Worth had won all the important four tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is planned there for August 14th to 16.
More planes in Worms in the future
The Wormser University continues to fly: The "DFS German Aviation Safety" establishes a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The Treaty was first concluded for three years and started in 2021.
The professor has the opportunity to allow the start of the study not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This enables as many students to be trained twice as ever.
At the same time, both in the university and at the Air Safety Academy of the DFS are equally charged.
The DFS will advise the university in the establishment and establishment of the professor.
Presented at the University since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been trained in flight training at the University of Worms in the Air Traffic Management studio.
This year, nine students have already started.
So far, the experience of the DFS is very positive, the students' performance is excellent.
The combination of study and Lotsen training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the Lotsen profession.
"In these times, the promotion is not easy.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and to grow again in the long term.
In order to meet our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Schürle, CEO of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation professorship is a future-proof investment, which will provide the fleets with a long-term broad, professionally cross-cutting knowledge base.
We therefore continue to cooperate well with the university and at the same time undermine our attractiveness as an employer."
Professor Jens Hermsdorf, president of the University of Worms, also underlines this: "The foundation professorship is an important bridge between science and the economy.
With her we would like to join the existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flying as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's study Air Traffic Management".
The confidence of German aviation insurance is to further develop its teaching and research competence in the future fields of air transport at the same time as the University of Worms motivation and commitment.
In use for tomorrow's flights, the university with the first foundation professor for a dual course of study could place very special highlights and innovative focus for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary of the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasises: "The University of Worms, with its focus on air transport, has a unique feature in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the Cooperation Treaty strengthens the profile of the university."
Rescuer land on A 45
Around 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was completely shut down on Saturday morning in direction of Ashchenburg, as after a traffic accident the rescue helicopter was in use.
A 76-year-old drove with a ford at 12.40 p.m. in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve and landed on the lead board.
The airbags were fired by the alarm, the driver suffered slight injuries in the face and had to be brought to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old companion were provided by the notary and the patient fled to a hospital as a result of the rescue scrapper.
At present, however, the police assumes that there is no danger of life.
The damaged vehicle with a damage of approximately EUR 2000 had to be removed.
Heil wants to examine other sectors according to the meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry back to light.
Laws are being tightened in the short term.
But they're right - and it's gonna stay there?
Federal Minister for Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other sectors in accordance with the strict rules currently planned against meat-producing maladies.
"We will look at the industry and then take appropriate measures for the industry, if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employer is already warning that work contracts should be restricted in general.
After the massive break-out of Corona during the meat-brained tonnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet will decide on a law of healing this Wednesday.
In the case of slaughter, slaughter and meat processing, wholesalers should no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel.
It is intended to prohibit the use of workers and leasers there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said, "Finger away from a general restriction on labour contracts and employee turnover if you do not want to completely abandon the economy".
For example, work contracts for wide areas of handicraft, construction industry and plant construction are the basis for their value creation with the customer.
"The faults of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My aim is not to prohibit working contracts anywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts are meaningful.
"If an industrial company is commissioned to establish a safety facility, this is a very normal work contract."
The German meat industry holds a ban on works contracts and lease work only in its sector for constitutional contradictions.
It is not possible to explain why other work law should apply in the case of the serving and packing of cheese in the future than in the case of Worst, as reported by the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
Thus, in the case of a ban, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 per cent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European workers from work contracts worked in the industry following the results of an examination of the NRW employment protection administration for 16 hours a day.
They often didn't have a break.
Wages were reserved for protection equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often poor.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, through "trisk constructions" these have been carried out.
"Now we need to be thoroughly cleaned."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to decide at the end of July in the Cabinet, there are also measures which not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher testing rates for labour protection or clear criteria for Community income".
The present draft includes amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat industry and to the law on the protection of workers.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) has more intensive controls to be required.
"I wish we could make more controls in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal protection, all possible, for example, animal transport," said Nonnemaker on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg Current".
However, more personnel are needed for more controls.
Three deaths in the destruction of ultralight aircraft in Germany
When an ultra-light aircraft crashed into a multifamily house in Wesel in the German state of Nordrhein-Westfalen, three people died, according to the police.
A child has been easily injured.
Two other people were injured in the accident, a speaker of the circuit manager Wesel said.
In the crash site, a crash screen was found, so the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported on eyepieces prior to the crash, the plane was crashing with a hot air balloon.
The house is a single or two-family house.
More details were not initially known.
Room of Frankfurt Opera Square in peace
A week after the departures in Frankfurt, the space of the opera room in the night will also be peaceful on Sunday.
Finally, a few dozen people stood up in the square, but left him at 1 hour before the beginning of the suspension.
Since the early evening, the police had been using numerous officials throughout the city to see a larger police offer.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, there was a ban on handling the site where it came to Krawalen a week ago.
Policemen were attacked by bottles from the number of parties out there.
At least five officers were injured after police entry, several police vehicles were damaged.

Car overruns: Young woman in accident on Bundesstraße 83 at Hofgeismar seriously injured
In case of an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old has suffered serious injuries on Sunday at 13.25 p.m.
She was taken to Kassel Clinic.
With the heat camera, the firefight sought a possible companion.
According to the police on the Bundesstraße 83, the woman was on the way towards her place of residence, when her car came down from the highway for an uncertain reason and overrun several times.
In order to save the unfortunate, the firearm had to cut off the roof of the pkw.
Since it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was removed from the trailer with a heat camera.
The Drohnenstaff from Warburg, which also works with heat cameras, was also ordered for the search.
However, the use forces did not find anyone among the tall corn plants.
The victim was brought with the rescue car to the Kassel Clinic for further supply.
Almost 50 use forces of the firefight Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The Bundesstraße was blocked for two hours because of the accident.
Youth Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a rescue door by Cristiano Ronaldo, the record champion Juventus Turin won the Italian championship for the ninth time in the series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the overall 36. Scudetto of the association history with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 a.m.
With 83 points, Turin, which entered without the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, no longer forced two days before the season end of the series A from space.
The table width of Inter Milan is seven points back.
Despite optical superiority in the first half of the day, Ronaldo met with the last action after a release.
One example of Miralem Pjanic was the 35-year-old from the Strafranium border directly with a flat-screen (45.+7).
Against the now offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved at 2:0, after his shooting Federico Bernardeschi (67.).
This ensured the smooth but decisive success.
The foulelfmeter sent to the latte in the 89th minute should only have led Ronaldo himself with a view to the Torjäger rating.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically up to 90 minutes high.
The games are rare, and the moment changes very easily," said Coach Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the spiritual creation of his players was great, the Juve coach said.
Because of the defeat, the tournaments had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
At the end of the day, you had to give thanks, in particular, for the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven parties before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team only won five victories.
Whether Ronaldo is still king of Torschützen is questionable.
Because during the Portuguese Superstar until 31 gates, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already reached the Lazio Rome table at the Hellas Verona – as many as Robert Lewandowski used to win the title of the FC Bayern, after his three-pack 5:1 (1:1).
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
In 2015/2016, the Argentinian reached 36 gates for the SSC Naples.
In August the "Old Lady" of the Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus stands at the eighth final of the Champions League, however, on August 7th against Olympic Lyon, he has to compete a 0:1 stage to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal authors recorded
Stuttgart - All threatened sentences and court judgments to the contrary, car drivers on numerous illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg streets continue gas: In the last year and the first four months of this year, the police have already registered more than 250 illegal authors in the southwest.
There are no comparisons for the previous years, but the racers are doing more work for the judicial authorities: in 2018, the state prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim had a total of 155 detection procedures due to illegal racing, one year later there were 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
There were fewer organised events during the race, as the Ministry of the Interior replied to a request from the SPD on the ground day.
In most cases, the drivers were spontaneous or they had taken the flight before the police - this is also shown as illegal races.
The tax was mainly for German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 Penalties - 15 times prison
In only a few cases, the breeders are obtained and also asked for cash: According to the Ministry of the Interior, 113 fines have been suspended since 2018 and 15 sentences have been pronounced.
However, there are no indications that the number of illegal authors is actually increasing.
A lot of other drivers responded because of the several tragic accidents and processes of past years more sensitive than before and showed more often, one ministry speaker said.
In Rasern, the highway is particularly popular. Car drivers are always slowed out there to get space and use the free route for a race.
In the past August, a dozen drivers were acquired near Kirchheim under Teck, and three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Marklingen.
A81 is the most popular racetrack
On the A81, the police even register more races than on any other federal highway.
With a Tempolimite, the breeds are tried to break out on the particularly affected section between the narrows and the geisings.
Most of the high-priced sports and luxury carosses often have Swiss marks, because the drivers for the high penalties for fast driving and car racing in the neighboring country have to move to Germany.
For the SPD, the Tempolimit cannot be reduced to a few lines: "With a general Tempolimit of 130 hours of time, we would create this problem on highways from the body," says Martin River, the transport experts of the SPD-Landtag Group.
"The threshold for racer would be significantly higher if you didn't have to be here and there legally with 200 hours and more on the way."
From explanation or image campaigns, Rivoir has less: "He who moves in this way over all the rules and not only his own life but also the life of other transport operators is not yet attainable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
On the other hand, ADAC does not seem to say: "We're going to assume that Raser doesn't get scared of the Tempolimits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also more stringent controls on the routes concerned.
From January 2019 to April 2020, three people died in the race, two of which were not involved in a night-time crash in Stuttgart's capital and one in Gerlingen.
There two young men were supposed to deliver an author in November.
One of the vehicles came down from the street, went against a garden wall and stayed on the side, the 18-year-old companion died.
21 other people were injured during the run of the past two years.
More severe penalties, however, are not necessary in the view of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: "legislative action is necessary in order to punish illegal motor vehicles more quickly," says the Ministry of the Interior.

Ackermann sprinted for victory at the final stage at Sibiu Tour
Radprofi Pascal Ackermann fought his second day victory at the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old pålzer from the Bora-hansgrohe team was sitting on the 109 km long section with start and goal in Hermannstadt in the masseuse after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the seasonals three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall evaluation, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger went through.
The 26-year-old had decided the mountain time for himself in the morning and thus took over the top of the class.
Only 104 drivers attended the final stage in the evening.
Not less than 18 beginners had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain season.
"I'm really happy to start the season-new with a victory," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
"The Sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the target, he just pulled his sprint, "and it also hit perfectly".
According to the rules of the World Association UCI, a corona test was carried out with all participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the complete tour, drivers and managers were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated health blasts.
Viewers at startup and destination were not allowed.

Nuremberg: Unapproved Tuning Meeting - Police strike, 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and over 1,000 people temporarily participated in a "tuning meeting" on the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police announced that such events should be monitored more closely.
A large Tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg Southstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police, at 22.30 p.m., an increase in vehicle turnover in the area of a large park in the Ingolstadt Street was detected by the Nuremberg Transport Police.
The police then took over a number of vehicle checks.
Just recently, the police had announced that they wanted to proceed more strongly against so-called autoposer.
Illegal Tuning Meetings in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers included good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, balancing the police.
However, only a small part of the members of the Autoposer and Tuning Scenes are to be assigned.
Apparently, most of the scene in question came to the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on the spot, it is necessary to assume that this was the case mainly for skilful persons.
In addition, the vast majority of residents remained in the current rules on protection of infection, in particular the content of the minimum level and the wearing of an oral nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at 1:00 p.m.
In total, the officials in 10 vehicles made such changes that the operating permit had been revoked.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No author
There were no illegal authors.
"The Central French Police Bureau will continue to keep the event in sight and will continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in connection with the appearance of spectators," it said.
The Agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the participating point of departure: "They have all the beautiful fields that we must not shorten," said Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company should be careful not to cause any damage.
"The young people are finally supposed to keep their cars unharmed."
Number of working agency: 900 suspicions of abuse in short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) is responsible for misusing around 900 cases in the short term.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies who have shown short work," said the Management Board responsible for the operation Daniel Terzenbach of the "Frankfurter General Zeitung".
When at the beginning of the Corona crisis many companies had suddenly applied for short-term work, the BA had to respond quickly.
Usually the test takes up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available in this hot phase.
More precisely, we will look at the conclusions.
I'm sure there'll be a few more.
We are not naive and have a long breath."
Indications of abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA analysis software is used to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvents than in the previous year?
The estimates go together, but we are fighting for the case and we are already training our employees in the labour agencies to process applications for insolvency money."
The numbers were still incomplete, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party dissolved in the new garden
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the new garden.
The assembly was dissolved at 20.48 a.m. by the rectors of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (PSSG), the Foundation shared on PNN request.
The young people would have left the park after that.
On Saturday evening, some young people in the new garden had played Rugby.
The Wiese was cleaned up by reviers, SPSG spokesperson Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
There's always going to be illegal holidays in the parks
In the parks of the Foundation, there are always collections where the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 procedure are not complied with.
At the end of June, it was a celebration with about 300 people in Babelsberg Park, a week later, about 150 people in the new garden celebrated.
Even without a corona regulation, the parks are closed when the darkness breaks in.
The camp on the meadows is prohibited according to parking rules, there are only a few exceptions.
The Foundation has long claimed that visitors would leave more dust and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal parking parties reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the Neukölln district, on Sunday night 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests for Corona break-out in tourist destination
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Austrian tourist resort St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the national authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still in the evening.
Thus, many of the infected young practitioners in tourism have been tested positively, but at least one holiday guest has been tested.
Citizens, guests and tourism workers were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday night.
The clock was set at 23 o'clock.
"There are reservations and cancellations there" of bookings, said the head of the Tourism Association Wolfangesee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Also, individual guests have been cancelled in advance.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 nights last year.
In a normal season, about one third of the guests are Deutsche.
On Friday, the first infections were publicly known.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behaviour of the practitioners who had celebrated and could have settled there.
"That's what we all liked to do in our youth," he said to the radio station Ö1.
However, on Friday, two bars were closed to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to sensitize young employees for the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, vacationers and locals were tested.
In addition, all the guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak brings back memories of the Austrian ski and party Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of Corona expansion throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
In Austria, more than 1,500 people are currently infected with the virus.
The focus of the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football recordmaker Manchester United returns after a year of absence to the Champions League.
The Red Devils secured the third table by a 2:0 (0:0) success against the direct competitors of Leicester City on the last day of the game of the Premier League.
The Foxes now have to deal with the Europe League because FC Chelsea has yet to pass and also qualified as a fourth for the royal class.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was able to rejoice.
Manchester United went through a sentence by Bruno Fernandes (71 minutes) in the leadership.
After a red card for Leicester City in the play time Jesse Lingard (90.+8) came to an end.
Chelsea, in the Champions League-Achtelfinale opponent of the FC Bayern, won with Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton hikers.
"This means a lot to me," said Coach Frank Lampard, who is also standing in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
From Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton, Tottenham Hotspur also benefited, which with a greater 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace still passed to the Wolves and started as a sixth in Europe League.
Aston Villa chose the remote duel with the FC Watford and the AFC Bournemouth, but at West Ham United it had to spend a long time in the classroom.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84.) glich Andrej Jarmolenko (85.) immediately.
But the 1:1 (0:0) was enough, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which missed three coaches in the season, rises after five years of first year.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
At the end, a point was missing.
The FC Liverpool, which has been established as an English master since the end of June, secured itself with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 numerators are the highest value ever achieved by Reds in a football season.
The score code in English football missed Coach Jürgen Klopp with his team only shortly.
The best brand holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle leadership in the first minute Virgil van Dijk (38.), Divock Origi (59.) and Sadio Mané (89.) turned the party on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said Torschütze van Dijk after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
At the end, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Because of the Coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even an early interruption or an extradition of the remaining games was discussed on a neutral basis.
Finally, however, the season could be played without special events at the end - however, as in Germany without viewers in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanjahu
The protests in Israel against Governor Netanyahus are becoming more and more fierce.
In the night, there have been violent conflicts.
On Sunday night in Jerusalem, the Israeli police violently took action against a protest against the law-conservative chief Benjamin Netanjahu.
Twelve people were arrested for unrest, police spokesperson Mickey Rosenfeld shared.
The police set up water heaters, among other things, to solve the communication.
In total, about 6,000 people gathered in close proximity to Netanjahus Amtsitz, according to media reports on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanjahu's treatment of the Corona crisis.
The protestors struck drums, got into horns, and called Netanyahu back.
It was also that participants in a protest were arrested, who supported Netanjahu, reported the news page "ynet".
Also in many other places in Israel, people demonstrated, including in front of the private villa of the chief government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested after police reports near Tel Aviv because he is suspected of being sprayed from a driving car pepper spray on protests on the street.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protestor in the south of the country.
The demonstration was easily injured on the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The announcements accompany the corruption process against the Head of Government.
At last, Netanjahu was also criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he will be given early locks and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has made the country's economy difficult.
The unemployment rate was at more than 20 per cent.
The number of new infections with the Coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to new record values.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter forces on car - nine injured - Ruhrde - Bild.de
Ahlen - On Saturday afternoon, on the B58 in Ahlen, nine minors were injured.
A driver was traveling with her two children (3,5) towards Beckum.
The police said, "Perhaps she had suddenly stopped because she wanted to turn around."
That must have been the driver of a Mercedes transporter who was driving behind her, probably too late.
He pulled back on the car.
In the case of the accident, three accidents were easily injured in the car and six in the carrier.
Several rescue cars took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea ranks the border city after Corona suspected
North Korea has so far seen a "lucky success" in its own actions to defend the Coronavirus.
Now, for the first time, the country reports a suspicion.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely settled a major city in fear of disaster.
Despite the most severe epidemiological resistance in the past six months, "the evil virus could have been dragged into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the situation has been suspended.
The Communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
If the suspect were confirmed, it would be the first official case of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the affected country.
North Korea had so far not registered a single infection, according to its own data, and described its defence measures as "lighting success".
The data were dubious abroad.
The disease symptoms were reported in a "outbreaker" that illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person moved three years ago to South Korea and has now returned across the border.
For the crossing of the border within the four kilometres wide and mostly still intended military buffer zone, there was first no confirmation from South Korea.
However, according to reports of the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military has reduced the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
This led to investigations into some people.
North Korea called for its own information on Saturday because of the suspicion of a police emergency meeting of the Workers' Party's Office under the chairmanship of Powerhaber Kim Jong Un.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim has already arranged as a precautionary measure on Friday to "block Kaesong completely and isolate every region and region from others", it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had contact with her, were placed under quarantine.
The Central Military Commission of the Party should therefore examine the "outbreak" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, impose severe penalties.
In Kaesong, about 300,000 people live according to estimates.
Temptation before the Council: City-Ost and noise protection are still ahead of a big summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental themes, the members of the body will vote on the construction plan for the major urban development project," it is said more recently in the middle of the city press release for the next municipal meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the large hall of CongressCentrums Pforzheim.
In particular, the evaluation of the eastern city will be discussed until the end of the controversy.
The majority of these are hardly, lastly even denying in individual committees according to presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT), which was developed by the citizens and then by the administration and municipality, is now not to allow preparation to fail after almost ten years, to criticise project opponents Reinhard Klein as "an extra-parliamentary opposition", "announcing", "speculation", "flashing" and "conscious false statements".
"All you think it's better to know," said a small member of the municipality who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim list for a year.
In fact, after reading the contracts in this position, he said, "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit will make the city cheaper, the Technical Council is opposed to the claims of the city administration after grants, from which little is convinced to heal for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently when you predict the city in the hall and on the side of the supporters from the economy.
The city by its own power and not to form an investor: that was its plan B. One day after a small day, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical Councilhouse, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the Ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller urban transformation in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental themes play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will primarily play a central role.
This is how the municipality will vote on the noise plan, among other things.
This includes a variety of measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise, caused by road traffic, including numerous temperature reductions.
In a press release, the German transport club welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, political leaders in the city are not innocent of this because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise, as the VCD, by neglecting the line bus traffic with exhausting rates and by little commitment to bicycle traffic.
The municipal council also agrees on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes the accession of the country's Baden-Württemberg Climate Protection Pact, the re-establishment of the parents' contributions to the city's children's day-care facilities, and the application for admission to the federal Smart City Promotion.
Citizens are welcome, but Corona's protection measures need to be improved.
With much delay Tim Zimmermann starts in the new season
With almost a half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann starts his first season at ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the super-sport car league can take up the regular operation, the first test rides now stopped.
For Zimmermann it was particularly important to get to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 more closely.
The Corona crisis has for a long time prevented Tim Zimmermann from attacking his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan by Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first rounds on the Lausitzring ring and was able to get used to his premieres in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the preseason," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go to the curves differently.
But it really made a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his first 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Netherlands has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I am not a beginner in motor sports, but every new series also brings new challenges to itself," Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I understand us blindingly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - on the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also extract his first race.
From July 31, the 33 supersport cars will be raced by the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series new ones, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest in the Motodrom.
"It worked fast and I had to get used to the track a little," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passports that you need to meet optimally to be fast".
How fast is Zimmermann then, it's out in two weeks.
"The teams, of course, poker a little at the tests," he says.
"In conclusion, however, we are very pleased and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tight-pressed calendar.
By the beginning of November, seven races will take place.
The momentary condition is that no viewers will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring Ex-Form-1-Pilot Niko Hülkenberg will be caught in the GT link.
British Minister for Transport of Quarantine Decision
The decision of the British Government to put Spanish vacationers under quarantine for two weeks after their return, according to press reports, has coldened the country's Minister of Transport.
Then Grant Shapps is currently calculated in Spain on holiday, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday.
Because of the Corona numbers rising again in Spain, the cabinet in London separates the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine.

In Austria, the government has also suspended quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rules apply to those who are only on holiday on Saturday, August 1st, and were not introduced overnight.
Spain is still considered one of the "safest countries" in Austria, for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers should have known in the past that there is a possibility that a quarantine for vacationers in Spain will be suspended," said Labour Deputy Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has made the effort to say Grant Shapp's message."
Almost a month after the end of Corona's stay in Spain and the outbreak of the severe outbreaks, the number of infections in the country is increasing again.
In particular, virologists make nightlife responsible for the recent expansion.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in Britain.
Of the non-necessary trips to the Spanish mainland, the British government currently advises that the canaries and Balearic Islands particularly popular with British holidayers are exempt from this.
So far, more than 272,000 infections have been reported in Spain with the new coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths.

The coronary pandemic in Texas makes the work of the helper difficult, said Abbott according to US media.
Evacuated for Caution
"Every Hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
With a view to the hurricane in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is still reinforced when you consider that it is being hit by an area that is the most affected area of the state of Covid-19".
According to John's Hopkins University, about 5,000 people died alone in Texas as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
You should not miss "the practices we've been used to," such as wearing masks, the Governor said according to the CBS envoy.
It was important that all the distances were kept.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
It is also intended to be tested on Corona in emergency cases.
The damage was first reported only from the coastal city of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, "Hanna" according to the authorities on the island of Padre Island was hit on land immediately before the Texas coast.
The tropical storm was previously raised to the Hurricane of the lowest level.

In view of the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, which an average even ten percent, was then called.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government was watching the storms and was in contact with the states concerned.
Four doors off: Video-Assistant "blessed" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic were equally known two doors
Naples - Four doors achieved, four doors unknown: Sassuolo Calcio experienced at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league Series A amber night - and was really mad at the video assistants of the reference.
"A festival not given to Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so hard on a team," the Corriere dello Sport commented.
Hoster Naples was led by a gate of foreign defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic first praised the compensation.
The Video Assistant Reference (VAR) took the hit back because of a remote position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball again into the net - again attacked the VAR.
The gates of attacker Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) also returned to the arbitration team as indicated by the VAR.
In the playtime, Allan made the 2:0 stop for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.

FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start in the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for Double-Sierier FC Bayern with a return.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after he has been injured by world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Midfield Chief Joshua Kimmich, has the third of the minutes of use, suffers a band injury to the left footroot and threatens to fail in decisive royal class duels.
In the München Schmuddelwetter, the lawyer broke off a training game and was driven out of the square with a golf card.
As long as the unrestricted tribal player has to pause the title in the fight, it is open.
An application in the eight-final game against FC Chelsea on 8 August may be difficult to apply, on 12 August, the 24-year-old final tournament starting in Lisbon can be expected.
But the Bavarians do not want to stop from mishandling on Sunday.
Flick called in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to the capital of Portugal.
Quality, intensity and concentration are expected to show its star title collection in the next 28 days to the King's class final game on 23 August.
"We have just mastered the duties with the Mastership and Pokal.
Now it's worth creating the special thing," said the girl.
Until the Munich can deal specifically with the final tournament and a training camp at the Algarve, however, the eight-final obligation is for the first time against FC Chelsea.
After 3:0 in the example before the Corona break, the Londoners in the domestic arena should not become like in the lost "final dahoam" 2012 again to the Bayern album.
"We have to go through the door for the first time.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game," asked the girl.
A test of consensus is being carried out on Friday against the Olympic Marseille.
With a long address, Flick had sworn to his stars, who had a 13-day vacation after the Double, on a single August.
31 players he welcomed on the Sebener Street, including the new players for the precious purchase of Leroy Sané, who first met all the new colleagues in the square after his shift from Manchester City.
"Leroy has put up good like all the new ones," said the girl.
But instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. can't just coach anymore, Flick spoke much more about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, it is now trained in team strength for the Londoners, who are unlike the Flick ensemble in the playhythm.
Afterwards, the Munich could face a quarter-final against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Mesi, in the semifinals are possible opponents to Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin.
A way to the finals in Lisbon "is not so easy," the chief coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The WM-Recordor Schüs and Flick know of so many joint tournament preparation, which comes with the 0-up-100 vote in particular.
With his current team, the work was "a pleasure", praised Flick.
The "focused on winning" was an impressive physical pull of his team.
At the tournament with Neuner's men, it went on Sunday, too.
All of the performers were also the willing Thiago and defender David Alabama, whose stay beyond the royal class season is not guaranteed.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world master
Since the required number of continents cannot be run, the FIA must improvise to forgive the WM title.
All American races have been cancelled.
Rising calendars are becoming more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
At the 10 confirmed Grand Prix, three further race routes were added during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring will take place in Germany and in Portuguese Portimão.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. fought on the Italian tradition line in Imola for WM points.
This includes the 2020 run calendar according to current status 13 runs.
"We are pleased that we will continue to make great progress in the completion of our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula 1-Boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races in the royal class of motor sport are to be completed during this exceptional season.
In conclusion, Formula 1 wants its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Prior to the already officially targeted races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports could still take place in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulation requires running on three continents
The regulation of Formula 1 requires at least three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents will run, there will be a world champion.
By means of a special rule, the FIA intends to give the title under "ordinary circumstances" because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cut short due to the impending Corona crisis.
A return to the continent is not yet a topic this year.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be in America this year.
Rejection in Brazil against Criticism
Due to the tense corona situation, the races in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We are looking forward to being with them again in the next season," Carey explained.
The discount of the American race was particularly critical in Brazil: "The discount did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, the number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to drive to Brazil would also not justify the rejection.
Prepare for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad view of Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was in Stephen Colbert's famous Latenight show per video switch to the guest and gave up in the interview, which she had in her head when she met Donald Trump.
Air conditioner Greta Thunberg was per video switch to guest in a popular US-Latenight show.
She related, among other things, her fight against the powers of the world.
Also about her famous "bad view" at her meeting with Donald Trump spoke to the teenager.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activists Greta Thunberg and its tireless use of the "Fridays For Future" movement paid attention to itself.
Now she spoke in a well-known Latenight show about her plans in the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your mission and conducted a long interview with the Swedish.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change but also about her conflict with the powers of the world.
"There are some things that have surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to get the focus away from the climate crisis," she was terrified.
"All from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children are going on the street," she experienced.
Heads of state and leading politicians, who laugh at them in social media or even try to silence them, find them "suddenly", as they show the reactions, "because they have no other answer to it".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw a bitter look behind the US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the Aktvistin sailed over the Atlantic, she has received a strong view of the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
A GIF was created from the short clip, that is, an animated image that eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump generators.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. president at the time?
Stephen Colbert answered the relatively open question only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
With the final answer, the experienced satirical Colbert probably didn't count and quickly disappeared from the picture.
With her "How there are you?" talk about the principles of climate protection, she kept many in mind at the climate conference.

Fleetwood Mac Founder Peter Green died
His life was like a back train: After a sudden climb with Fleetwood Mac it went steeply up and then slowly up again.
Now the bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
The founder of the Fleetwood Mac band, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully at the age of 73 and shared with family members on Saturday in an official opinion, a further opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton valued Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the Fleetwood Mac band.
The Battlemaker Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had established the longest legendary band in London in 1967, and to this day, his dream instrumental hit "Albatross" has been forgotten.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") is a back-walk.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated its greatest success then without it.
Among other things, there should have been a dispute because Green wanted to make all the profits of the Group for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in large walls and with a large cruzifix.
Psychiatric problems should also have played a role.
Three years after the foundation Green left the band in 1970.
It followed a social descent.
The bluesrock guitarist was under drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time Green was treated in psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the image.
He was supposed to live on the street for a while when he worked as a peacekeeper and spent a long time in an Israeli Kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as a son of a Jewish worker family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
In his early years, he was a fan of American blue musicians like B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of 11, he learned the first guitar recordings.
At the age of 15, the teen began playing professional guitar and five years later got the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Louners.
Shortly thereafter, he was hired as a replacement for his Idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the Blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green protected the group in winter 1968/69 the first number 1 hit and catapulted it at the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed his shadow pages: Green did not strengthen the media envelope, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
The life between music and search he later commented in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is drugs - the best was to land a number one hit".
By the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprising success with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac then swam without him in a new formation on a successful wave.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite a number of small solo successes, Green did not achieve any greater comeback until he started again with a group of friendly musicians in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star that returned to the earth.
Free of drugs Green released some albums with Peter Green Splinter Group until the band was released in 2004.
For music experts he was already a blue legend - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
