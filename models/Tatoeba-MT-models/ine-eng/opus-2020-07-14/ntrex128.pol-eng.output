The members of the Welsh National Assembly are worried that they will be called muppets
Among some members of the National Assembly, the Consensus was a result of the proposal to change their title to the members of the Walloon Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, MWP).
The idea was created in connection with the plans to change the assembly in the Walloon Parliament.
The members of the meetings on all sides of the political scene are concerned that they can become the subject of the kpin.
One of the parliamentarians from the Labour Party expressed concern about its grouping, saying that the new name coincides with the Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh the word "twp" means stupid, and the word "pwp" means departures.
One of Plaid Cimru's politicians found that his group was "unsatisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
The Wallier Party member said that his party was "open" to the name change. However, he noted that the word "MWP" is very close to the word "muppet".
In this case, the waly letter "w" is similar to the letter "u" in the Yorkshire English dialect.
As part of the Commission's meeting, which is currently working on a draft Act amending the name, it took the following position: "The final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will be their own."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal, and the change of assembly in the Walloon Parliament was greatly supported.
In addition, the Commission supported the proposal to change the title of the members of the assembly to the "Member of the Walloon Parliament", that is, WMP in English, although this short "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity among the public.
The members of the assembly propose alternative solutions, and difficulties in reaching consensus are the loss of Elin Jones, the chairman of the assembly, who should present the draft bill during the next few weeks.
The Act introducing the reform will also take into account other changes in the way in which the assembly works, including the rules on the removal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title during the discussion of the Act.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change of country name
In the next week, the voters will decide whether their country will bear the name of the Republic of North Macedonia soon.
The general vote is intended to help bring about a lasting struggle with neighboring Greece, in which there is a region called Macedonia.
The Athens Government has long claimed that their northern neighbour's name is a territorial claim and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Mr Ivanov, President of Macedonia, and the opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said that the results of the vote would be good.
However, plebiscite supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the amendment is necessary to enable the State to join the European Union and NATO.
Call in the New York church of St. Marcina Milk in connection with the problems of the church in Harlem
“The older people I talk to say that there was a bar and church in every corner in the past,” said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's no sign of them at all."
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People are currently associating in a different way” he observed.
"The parties ceased to be a regular meeting of members of the community".
In the case of churches, however, he is concerned that the funds from the sale of the property are not sufficient for as long as the decision-makers consider them to be, and that “they are at the point of exit sooner or later”.
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartments inhabited by people who would not support other surrounding temples.
As he said, “The approaching majority of people buying apartments in such buildings will be the white race, which will speed up the total closure of churches, because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by the gathering of the faithful, even before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the church of St. Marcina joined the community decades later).
The first meeting of white Methodists left the district in the 1930 ’ s.
The surrounding Africans' gathering took over the property right to the building.
The church of St. Marcina was taken over by a gathering led by a huge John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the 125th street vendors (the main trade street in Harlem), who opposed the employment or advancement of African Americans.
The fire of 1939 greatly damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson’s paraffin made the temple’s reconstruction plans and repaired the bells.
The great David Johnson, the son of John Howard Johnson and his successor in the church of St. Marcina, proudly called the new carylon "the call of the poor".
The expert who called in July described them in a different way, such as "cultural treasure" and "unreplaced historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the first carylon in the world to be served by black music. The artist was Dionysio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the Church of Riverside Church, where he was waiting for a larger team.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Marcina's church did not replace him.
In the last months of St. Marcina’s church, there have been a number of complex events involving architects and performers.
In July, the Parafial Council (a parafia management body made up of the secular leaders) addressed its concerns, claiming that "it wants to pass the costs on to the council", although the Council did not participate in the employment of the architects and performers sent to the scene.
Some of the paraffins also complain about lack of transparency on the part of the diecesion.
Rekin wounded 13-year-old snooping in search of lobsters in California
The authorities found that last Saturday the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old who was looking for lobsters in California.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel brought the KSWB-TV station to San Diego that on Saturday morning he would dive with his friends about half an hour when he heard a call for help. Immediately with a group of friends rushed to the boy to help him get out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first it seemed to him that the boy was excited about catching the lobster, but soon he realized that the child was shouting: “I’m being bitten!
I've been bitten!"
After arriving at the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had a completely different skin around the shoulder.
"I started screaming to everyone to escape the water: "There is a shark in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Children's Council Hospital in San Diego. His condition was defined as critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During the press conference, Captain Larry Giles said that fish had been observed a few weeks earlier. However, it was recognized that it was not part of the species of endangered sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper body.
In order to carry out the investigation and for safety reasons, the authorities closed the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca for 48 hours, until after Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noticed that the area is inhabited by more than 135 species of sharks, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's network plans to expand activities in the British cosmetic market
The Sainsbury's network throws handcuffs to shops such as Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, introducing cosmetics in its supermarkets that are styled in shopping homes, as well as specially trained sellers.
As part of a significant investment in the British cosmetic market, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and is constantly developing despite the fall in the fashion industry and household goods, there will be more rules on cosmetic products in 11 online stores.
The return to the cosmetic industry results from the search for ways of managing the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household articles.
According to Sainsbury's network will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer even 3,000 articles. In the assortment for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw will appear.
Currently sold brands L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees also receive more places and separate areas close to these famous shops Boots.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to renew its offer of products to make Boutique. From now on, most articles will be friendly to ghettos, which are increasingly required by younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first one opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, and the second one will be in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in later period of the year.
The frequency of online and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local stores makes supermarkets have to encourage more visitors.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury's, said that sales points would be more and more reminded of goods houses, because the network is trying to fight disputes, such as Aldi or Lidl, by offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's has put Argos network points in hundreds of stores and has introduced a number of Habitat network points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increasing sales of food items and increasing investment profitability.
The previous attempt to reorganize parts with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals ended with failure.
At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots. However, cooperation was concluded following a conflict of income sharing from patents operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's introduces a new strategy following the sale of 281 optics by Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds reports that it will contribute to the implementation of the plan by introducing an extended offer of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four network stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of the Sainsbury's business, said: "We have studied the appearance and nature of cosmetics in order to improve the impressions of customers.
We have invested in special training for collaborators to help consumers during purchases.
Our brands are able to satisfy all needs, and friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to pay attention to the customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the ways of making purchases so far."
Peter Jones "suffered" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a contract worth 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Dan's TV program, was "suffering" when he found out that Holly Willoughby was going to withdraw from worth 11 million pounds of lifestyle brand to focus on new collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household items called Truly.
The activity was compared to the Goop brand belonging to Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, 37-year-old presenter announced her departure through Instagram service.
The sudden decision to leave a well-professed lifestyle brand and focus on the new collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV made by Holly Willoughby led Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Day.
According to sources, Peter Jones was "suffering" when a popular television show announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that because of new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds, there will be no time to dedicate their March offering the accessories and household articles of Truly.
The company was first compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand. She also had to double Holly Willoughby's worth of 11 million pounds.
Following the announcement of a decision to leave Truly's brand by the 37-year-old Holly Willoughby in Instagram, Peter Jones left Britain, joining one of his summer homes.
According to the source, “Truly’s brand was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She's been connected to her future and wanted to take care of her for decades to come.
The decision to withdraw from the activity completely surprised all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday.
In Marlow's warehouse, the goods are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the resignation of the presenters of this Morning programme and one of the most successful stars in the United Kingdom can cost the company millions of pounds in view of significant investments in products – including articles from candles through clothing and household items – as well as further delays in entry into the market.
It can also mean the end of a long - term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin for ten years maintained close relations with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp founded Truly's brand in 2016 and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March at the presidency.
The couple spent time together, and Jones was involved in 40% of the television production of Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is to become an M&S ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin as the host of the I'm A Celebrity program at the ITV station.
The source near Peter Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business".
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love with each other."
The president joked about the criticism of the media that was made of the attention that some considered to be "a stateless husband", as well as a positive relationship with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump submit so much?
Trump said in a funny voice, giving a television presentation:
"I didn't give up anything."
The president pointed out that Kim Dzong Un was interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was called by Trump a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, nuclear disarmament negotiations are lagging behind.
After more than three months since the June summit in Singapore, the Chief of North Korean Diplomacy Ri Yong Ho told the world leader at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a "analogic response" from the United States to the early North Korea action aimed at disarmament.
He noted that instead of this, the United States maintains sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we're maintaining a great relationship."
The president said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Dzong Un have had a positive impact: they have led to the completion of missile tests, helped free hostages and return to the rest of the American soldiers at home.
He also defended his unusual approach when discussing relations with Kim Dzong Un.
"It's easy to behave after the president, but instead of 10 thousand people waiting outside and trying to get to the crowded stadium, we would have 200 people here," Trump said, showing his thumb to the crowd gathered directly in front of us.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia have recently destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Despite the loss of the roof over the head by more than 10% of the people of Lombok, the authorities have not announced a natural disaster, which is a necessary condition to accelerate international aid.
"In many cases the authorities have made it very clear that they do not want international support, so the situation is difficult," Selina Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, there is no doubt that international personnel will be able to operate on site.
Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Agency for Natural Disasters, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Pala, to see if assistance from international organisations should be allowed.
In the face of constant shocks in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to meeting the forces of nature.
Although shelters have been built in the province of Aceh in case of tsunamis, they are rare in the case of the rest of the shoreline.
The lack of oxygen warning the tsunamis in Pala, despite issuing a warning, is likely to have an impact on the number of deaths.
Even in the most favourable conditions, travelling between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural cells make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on the island of Lombok, is heading with the help of the victims of earthquakes to the city of Palu. However, you will reach the goal of taking at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has improved Indonesia's infrastructure at the top of his campaign and has allocated a lot of funds on the roads and railway lines.
However, in the light of future elections, the President's administration is in a position to deal with the lack of resources.
In addition, Joko Widodo was found under pressure from the insistence of the country on religious grounds. Members of the majority of the Muslim community accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people have died, and tens of thousands of people have lost their heads as a result of the struggle between Christian gangs and Muslims using swords, bows, arrows, and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool football Daniel Sturidge gets the gate for the remix in the Chelsea match
Daniel Sturidge saved Liverpool from the defeat of Chelsea in the English Prime Minister League, winning the opening in the 89th minute of the Saturday match played at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge was given by Jherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres away from Chelsea gate at 1:0 for the disadvantage of his team.
Before giving a shot in the direction of the remote gate, he put the ball on his left leg.
The ball pushed high above the criminal field towards the top right corner of the net.

"I noticed the approaching Kantego, I took the ball, and I gave the shot without a deeper thought."
Chelsea was leading 1:0 in the middle of the game after the Belgian star Eden Hazard shot in 25 minutes.
The Nebula attacker dug a fifth ball to Mateo Kovacica, and then ran towards Liverpool.
Fighting quickly accepted the injection in the middle of the bowl.
He then performed a beautiful performance ahead of him in the field of crime with his return to Hazard.
Hazard was ahead of the rebels, and he left his left foot in the direction of a long column of arrows that passed through the gate of Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet with Naples Club in the group League of Masters on Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will meet with Videoton in the UEFA League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.

Cromwell's memory before the British Parliament's last victim in the dispute of "renewal of history"
The removal of the memory would bring justice to the Taliban's warning of the destruction of many English cultural and religious remains by its radical, Puritan worshipers.
However, Cromwell Society's association described Jeremy Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and a "try to write history again".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Since the ongoing debate on the removal of monuments was a matter of time before the Westminster Palace, the issue of the status of Oliver Cromwell.
Imagery in the course of the English domestic wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps his predecessor Thomas was determined to punish not this Cromwell for his actions.
The way in which Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell in the memory shows how this policy was enjoyed in the 19th century and that for many people it is a character that is still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: “By many people Cromwell was seen – perhaps more often in the 19th century than at present – for the defence of Parliament against external pressure, of course it was the monarchy.
The assessment of the extent to which it is appropriate is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
Of course, the 17th-century conflict has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that identifies one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as a protector also deserve to be taught and remembered."
In China, there has been a death torturing of the farmer by pigs
According to local media, the trade in the south-west of China has resulted in a deadly attack by pigs on the farmer.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and with a broken stomach near the shop in the town of Liupanshu, in the province of Kuajču.
The pig breeder prepares for vaccination in Chlevan, 30 May 2005, Xining, Province of Qinghai, China.
According to reports, a man came to the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning the priest found the man's body and noticed the door open to the nearby roof.
He said there was a great request for blood in the rigue.
The body section confirmed that it was nearly 250 kilograms of pig fatally disturbed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and re-incarnated," said a man named Wu quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The material from the surveillance camera shows that Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The store manager said in an interview with the Guiyang Evening News service that at the time of the police's collection of evidence, the request was withdrawn to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the male family and the trade authorities negotiate compensation for death.
Cases of swine attacks on humans have already been reported, although they are rare.
In 2016 the pig attacked the woman and her husband at the farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered fatal injuries.
Ten years ago, in Wallia, about 300 kilograms of pigs spewed the farmer into the tractor, and the man's wife managed to pull the animal away.
After eating a farmer from Oregon through pigs in 2012 one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can free them from brutal behavior.
"They just want to have fun.
They're so interested in nothing... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them proper respect," he said.
Residues after the hurricane of Rosa cause intense rainfalls in the south-west part of the United States
According to the forecasts of the hurricane, Rosa is losing its power, moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, it causes intense rainfalls in northern Mexico and south-west parts of the United States.
Hurragan Rosa knows at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 p.m., he was given category 1. There was then 620 km south west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to a Sunday forecast, Rosa moves north.
In the meantime, the Pacific Ocean begins to form as an easterly direction on the western coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving the masses of wet air to the north, to the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, he will bring a drop of up to 25 cm in the territory of Mexico.
In the coming days, wet tropical air in contact with the approaching below causes rainfalls in the South West of the United States.
In some places a fall of 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden floods, pollution displacement and possible droughts in desert areas.
Wild tropical air causes falls from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour anywhere. This is particularly true in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in some regions of the South West of the United States, especially above much of Arizona.
In view of the widespread nature of tropical rainfall, sudden floods and severe changes in conditions can be made.
In view of the threat of tropical rain, it is decided to take a walk through the desert.
Limeballs can change canyons into river streams, and storms with piorunas cause local wind and dust movement.
Coming rather than bringing local rainfalls on the southern coast of California.
There are possible rains of a total height of more than 1,3 cm, which may cause small movements of pollutants and road hazards.
It would be the first fall of this rainy season in the region.
The tropical rains will begin to reach Arizona late on Sundays and early Mondays. On Monday afternoons and Tuesdays the fall will occur on a larger number of areas.
On Tuesday, the rains will reach the Four Corners region in the western part of the United States and will last until Wednesday.
In October, together with cooling in the Arctic region throughout the United States, temperature fluctuations may occur. However, in the inter-urban area there will be more heat.
It can lead to severe temperature changes in small distances.
A good example is the weekly temperature differences in the central part of the States.
Between Kansas City (stan Missouri) and Omaha (stan Nebraska) and between St. Louis (stan Missouri) and Des Moines (stan Iowa) these differences are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, the annual temperatures may rise again.
In large parts of the Central and Eastern United States, the warm beginning of October is expected. The temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to the northern part of the East.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature can reach 27 degrees Celsius, about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term weather forecasts indicate a high probability of a higher temperature in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Bretta Kavanaugh's hearings
More than 20 million people have been watching six television stations running a quarterly hearing with Judge Bretta Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, the commentators had to interrupt regular programmes to inform about the sudden return: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly prosecution investigation.
Christine Blasey Ford testified to the Senate's court commission that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had noticed her in her carelessness and tried to take off her clothes during a private party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that there was no such situation.
It is possible that the fifth number of televisions was even greater than that given by Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company accounted for the average number of TV stations CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, data were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty in measuring the visibility of people at work.
The number is approximated to the visibility of U.S. football puppies or the award of the American Film Academy.
According to the report Nielsen Fox News Channel, whose representatives firmly supported the Kavanaugha nomination, had the highest visibility. It was an average of 5.69 million views during the daily interview.
In the second place, the ABC station was located of 3.26 million views.
CBS had 3.1 million views, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake became a key figure in Friday's events.
In the early hours, he was arrested by the CNN and CBS station cameras after the office of this moderate Republican declared that he had decided to support the Kavanaugh nomination, and he shouted at demonstrators who had made it difficult for him to enter the elevator on the way to the hearing of the judicial commission.
Flake with his head released for a few minutes listened to the unfavourable opinions. The whole event was broadcast by the CNN station.
"I'm standing here in front of you and I'm asking.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
You have the power in the face of so many women," he heard from a demonstration woman.
Before the opening of the Jeff Flake elevator, he said that his office had issued an appropriate statement and that it would be heard during the hearing of the commission.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast events in anticipation of a vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh in front of the whole Senate.
Flake said that only after he knew that the FBI was investigating the charges in the coming week, which the majority of the Democrats were responsible for.
Flake was convinced by some of the talks with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after meeting with Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election was important because the Republic would not have the votes necessary to approve the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI case on charges brought against Bretta Kavanaugh.

Shooting Wayde's Sims: police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected of murdering LSU
Police arrested suspected of killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in the colors of the University of Louisiana State (LSU).
According to the Baton Rouge police command, two-and-a-half-year-old Dietteon Simpson was arrested and put in custody indicted for second-degree murder.
The authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson.
As related to the CBS station, the WAFB police officers found these eyeglasses on the site and found traces of DNA Simpson on them.

The police officer thanked the search team for Louisiana State Police, the crime lab of the state police, the Southern University Police and the nearby residents for assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of LSU sports, thanked local law enforcement authorities for "working and seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A man measuring 198 cm grew up in Baton Rouge. His father Wayne Sims also played in a basketball game in LSU.
In his last season, he scored on average 5,6 points and 2,6 sets per match.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "stirred" and "strung" by Wayde's death.
"It's one of the things we're constantly worried about," said Will Wade.
A half emitted by the volcano in Mexico City
The half of the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern parts of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for the Prevention of Natural Disasters decided to bring the inhabitants of Mexico closer to the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and dust within 24 hours.
The Centre has noted numerous concerns and concerns.
Published in social media photos show the front seats of cars covered with a thin layer of ashes in Mexico's districts, such as Xochimilco.
Since the earthquake of 7.1 degrees in Mexico in September 2017, geophysics have recorded an increase in volcanic activity of 72 km south-east of the country's capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The senior Catalan separatist police officer before the annual referendum on independence
On Saturday in Barcelona, six persons were arrested as a result of senior demonstrators supporting Catalonia's independence with preventive police forces. On that day, thousands of people took part in their own demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the exciting referendum on the Catalan section.
The group of masked separation fans threw out the eggs and color of the police officers. The dark clouds of dust poured down the streets usually full of tourists.
It was also reached in the late part of the day. To stop the police force fighting, they used a stick.
For a few hours, groups of supporters of independence scandalized "Don't forget, we don't forgive". The opponents of the sessions shouted "Niech lives Spain".
As local press reports, 40 people received medical assistance in connection with minor injuries suffered during the protests.
After a year from the referendum of 1 October, tension is not weak. Although the authorities in Madrid considered it illegal, there is still a reason for celebrating the desired Catalan sessions.
The majority voted for independence, but the frequency was low in view of the widespread number of opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost a thousand people suffered injuries last year in brutal olds with police trying to prevent voting at the polls.
On Friday evening, a group of people supporting the region's independence decided to prevent demonstrations by supporting policemen.
Nevertheless, the demonstration took place, but a change of course was forced.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician involved in separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we survived one of our most beautiful moments in our life.
My parents cried out with joy that they could vote, but now we're stuck to the point without going out," he said.
In spite of the important but small achievements in the local elections last December, the parties supporting the Catalonia section have difficulty continuing their activities. Many of the most recognised leaders have decided to leave or expect to be arrested in the process due to the role played in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a four-and-a-half-year-old protest-supporting mechanic, said that politicians on both sides of the dispute are fueling conflict.
"The situation is becoming increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced his wish to start in the next year's elections to the European Parliament.
"The election of the European Parliament is the best way to alleviate the crisis of the democratic values of the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after driving home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested as a result of several car hits in Londonderry’s home.
The event took place in Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 a.m. British time (BST).
Commissioner Bob Blemmings from the investigation department said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At a certain point in the direction of the car, a bullet from the body could also be fired.
Mengi's Gate ensures Livingstone's victory over Rangers 1:0
The first goal of Dolly's Mengi for Livingstone brought the winning team
From this season on, the Livingston Club Extracluster has made the Rangers an exception, giving Steven Gerrard a second defeat in his 18 matches at the Ibrox Park Club Coach's position.
The Dolly Mengi branch proved to be a victory, and Gary Holt's team moved to the second place in the table with Hibernate.
The team will meet with the leader of the Hearts, who loses eight points next Sunday.
Earlier, because on Thursday, Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA European League.
Livingston is extending a series of victories in his division to six matches. Coach Holt did not notice the failure of his replacement in the last month of Kenny Miller.
Livingston has missed several occasions against undisputed opponents
The team led by Holta should have been running a long time ago, as the team's game has contributed to the number of problems.
First, Scott Robinson went through the defense and gave him a shot in the light of the gate, but he couldn't shoot the goal. Then Alan Litgow didn't get to the head of Craig Halket.
The owners allowed Ranksom to play closer to the gate, knowing that they could threaten the rivals during the constant fragments of the game.
And that's how the gate was torn apart.
After the Rangers fired the Livingston Free Team, they found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created the situation of Mendze, who got naked from within the criminal field.
At this stage, Rangers had more possessions, but they were unable to force the defenses of the economy and did not cause more problems for Liam Kelly.
The schematic was repeated in the second half, and Alfredo Morelos gave one shot at Kelly's door.
Scott Pittman's sample was chosen by the Rangers of Allan McGregora, and Lithuania was unable to hit the gate in light of the next permanent fragment that was destined for Livingstone.
The Rangers continued their attacks in the Livingstone field, but they could not use the situation. Two sentences were requested after Halket's intervention against the changeover Glenn Middleton and one handout. However, in both cases, the claims of the winners were rejected.
Livingston’s “Fenmenal” – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingstone.
In his view, they played a great game, again and again, going beyond expectations.
Their style and composition almost did not change from going back to the extraclass. However, you should appreciate Holta to motivate the team to the game.
This match had a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role, leading a well-organised defense, and Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall very careful throughout the match.
There's no way to fight.
While Gerrard's leadership is a great time for them, they did not support their standards in this game.
There seemed to be something missing in their game: only once did it go through the defense of the economy. This should be a serious warning to the Rangers who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan visit in Colonia
During Saturday's breakfast in Berlin (29 September) Turkish and German leaders accompanied smiles and beautiful weather.
It was the last day of the rising controversy of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, with the aim of improving the relationship between NATO allies.
There have been differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After meeting Erdogan, he went to Colony, where he opened a new, huge match.
In this city, the largest number of Turks lives outside their homeland.
According to the police, for security reasons, a 25-twenty-year-old crowd gathered in front of the temple was blocked, but the president's supporters gathered around to see their leader.
The opposition groups of Erdogan – including many Kurds – also decided to express their opinion by congratulating the Turkish leader's policy and the German government's decision to adopt the country's policy.
On the contrary, the protests reflect the division which prompted the visit of the politician called by a part of the Turks living in Germany and recognized as an autocrat by others.

In the HMP Long Lartin prison facility, more than 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports in June, the director of the firm had to go to the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, prevention units were called to the plant because of the dangerous environment in which workers were attacked by bullets in the balance sheet.
The sudden flood caused by the Rosa hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial effects on areas covered by drought)
It is rare that tropical depression will reach Arizona. It is likely that it will arrive at the beginning of next week. The remnants of Rosa's hurricanes are moving around the desert areas of the South West, creating a threat of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of the possibility of a sudden flood on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona, South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to a forecast Tuesday, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix. On Monday afternoon rain will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported via Twitter that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a stormy state or tropical depression within 320 km of Phoenix.
Hurragan Katrina (in 1967) approached 65 km from the border of Arizona."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict rainfall from 5 to 10 cm. In some areas Mogollon Rome in Arizona can reach a height of up to 15 cm.
In other desert areas of the South West, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Catline, the rainfall is likely to rise from 2.5 to 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
In addition to areas threatened by sudden floods associated with the hurricane of Rosa, people can be relieved, as the region has been struggling with droughts for some time.
Although the flood is a serious threat, part of the rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where the drought is in place.
As the weather.com portal provides, U.S. Drought Monitor's service estimates that almost 40% of Arizona's area matches the affected droughts in the second of the highest categories.
Hurragan Rosa first gets to the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with hurricane force, reaching speeds up to 137 km/h. Currently it is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is heading north at 19 km/h.
Hurragan is pumping colder waters of the Pacific, causing its weakening.
According to the forecast, a tropical storm will hit Mexico in the afternoon or evening.
Intensive rainfalls in some parts of Mexico may pose a major flood threat.
The weather.com portal stated that "in the area from the California Peninsula to the north-western part of Sonora state, falls from 7 to 15 cm are expected, although they can reach 25 cm".
Then the hurricane of Rosa will pass through Mexico in the north in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early hours of the morning, it reaches the border of Arizona as a tropical depression. On Tuesday evening it will enter the southern part of Utah state.
"The most serious threat posed by the Rosa hurricane or its remains is a very low rainfall in the California Peninsula, in the north-west part of the state of Sonora and in the south-west desert areas of the United States," says National Hurricane Center.
According to the forecast, the rains are causing life-threatening sudden floods and pollution in the desert and mud in the mountainous region.

Trump found that Brett Kavanaugh "discovered anger and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote given to Judge Kavanaugha is a vote against the indiscriminate and repulsive proceedings of the Democratic Party," Trump said at the age of in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump found that Kavanaugh "discovered anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh confessed to the congress. He was constantly and emotionally opposed to the charges of Christina Blasey Ford. A woman claims that a few decades ago, when they were both teenagers, the man was allowed to commit sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified during the hearing on the charges brought by her.
On Saturday, the president said that that day, "Americans could be convinced of the brightness, class and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The voice given to Judge Kavanaugha is the voice of support of one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, a knower of great rights for the community," he said before the populace in West Virginia.
The President did not refer simply to the nomination of Bretta Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of the frequency of the Republicans in cases of half the presidential election.
"From the most important choices in our lives, we are divided into five weeks.
I do not start in these elections, but I remain very active," he said.
"I keep fighting against our great candidates."
The Trump claims that the Democrats are pursuing a policy of "resistance and hard work".
As the CNN station said one of the assistants of the important Republican Party policy, the first key Senate vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia. Number of victims is growing
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people died – many of which were kidnapped by the high waves breaking down on the beach – following a severe earthquake on the land and tsunamis that visited the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday in Pala, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in the city of the festival. On the west side, they hit waves of up to 6 meters high, destroying many people and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunamis resulted in an earthquake of 7.5 degrees Fahrenheit [7.5 ° C].
"When the threat came to light yesterday, the people who stayed on the beach did not run away immediately and fell victim to the tsunami," he said at a conference in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disasters of BNPD.
"Tsunami attacked everything on its way, driving cars, colds and homes," Nugroho added. He added that before reaching the shoreline, the food moved to the sea at 800 km/h.
As he said, some of them were saving their way to the tree and they were able to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Pala.
Many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and flooded bridges and water-circuits are seen in the photographs published by the Agency for Natural Disasters.
On Saturday, the coastal city was visited by a second shock.
A number of earthquakes have occurred in the area of 2.4 million people.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT), energy released by the widespread fifth earthquake was about two times greater than the energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement stated that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of the long, narrow bay, could have been affected by the tsunamis.
Sutopo Purvo Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said that the strike had fallen hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels.
He then added that the body part of the victim was found under collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 persons were considered missing.
Nugroho said that the deaths and injuries could be greater along the coast line 300 km north of Pala, in the area called Dongal, which was near the Earthquake Epicenter.
According to Nugro, the communication "was entirely shared", so there are no reports from the province of Dongal.
“A town of more than 300 thousand people” – can be read in the Red Cross statement. It has also been added that workers and volunteer organizations appear in the affected areas.
"Now we can talk about tragedy, although the situation may lead to a significant deterioration," the statement stated.
On Saturday, the agency met with a general criticism of the lack of information on the impact of the tsunamis in Paul. However, the authorities said that the waves had come just after the warning was given.
On the amateur video released in social media, you see a man screaming from the building, trying to warn of the coming tsunamis of people on the street.
Within a few minutes, the wall of the water broke down on the shore, destroying buildings and cars.
The Reuters agency was unable to confirm the authenticity of the recording immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused significant shortages in the supply of electricity, preventing communication in the region of Pala, which has, in turn, made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
According to the military authorities, the air carriers began to send from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic items of the first need.
The airport located in the city is open only for humanitarian transport. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo will visit the centres for people evacuated to Pala.
Over 800 victims of tsunamis in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
According to Doseba T. Sinaiy, the National Director of World Vision, the staff of this organization arrived safely from the province of Dongal to the city of Pala and found shelter in rents from the estate of the office.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some of the groups are slow to get help, the criticism has been expressed that the travel to Paul is impossible for workers from foreign humanitarian organisations with a rich experience.
According to Indonesian law, the acceptance of funding, resources and foreign personnel can only start after the disaster has been announced in the area of national disasters.
It wasn't done by now.
"We are officially still facing a regional disaster," said the Indonesian speaker of the Red Cross.
"When the government recognises that a national disaster has occurred, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but this has not yet happened."
After two days of the fifth earthquake of the earth and the tsunami in Paul, friends and families of those who have been lost still live hope that their loved ones will find themselves in the midst of destruction.
A little boy was pulled out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who spent two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian paralytic representation, trained two missing paralytics who took part in this month's final in the Asian Games in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandagi said, other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As an experienced paralytic, I am struggling with my own emotional burden," he announced.
Gendon Subandano told us that within hours of the arrival of the community, the co-pilot information about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was sent by a communicator WhatsApp to athletes participating in the beach festival.
His message was marked only by one grey duck instead of a pair of sharks in the blue.
“It seems to me that this means that the messages have not been delivered” he said.

Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Raper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
Publishing his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote about himself, "A person known earlier as Kanye West".
Forty-one-year-old music has been using the pseudonym Ye already. It's also the title of his eight album released in June.
The change took place prior to a visit to the Saturday Night Live program. It is expected that during the artist's performance, he will present his new album at Yandhi.
He will replace the songwriter Arian Grande, who, according to the authors, has refused to participate in "for emotional reasons".
West has already stated that the word "Ye" is not only short of his current artistic heritage, but it is religious.
“It seems to me that “yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Scriptures it means “You”,” said West in a previous period of the year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter about the pseudonym Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – reflecting all of our good, bad and corrupt features.
The album shows who we are."
West was in the midst of other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former co-worker West, also recorded his pseudonym in various ways, with a connector, without a connector and with large letters.
President Elect of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obador undertakes not to use military against civilians
In the early 50th anniversary of the bloody demonstration of the student president's election of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obador (AMLO) committed never to use the military against the civilian.
On Saturday at the site of the Three Cultures López Obador promised "never to use troops to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fires in the direction of a peaceful demonstration, killing even 300 people. It happened at a time when left-wing movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obador promised to support young people living in Mexico by providing monthly financial assistance for students, as well as by creating more free public schools.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunity for young people to become a criminal group.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence research
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, along with the increase in Chinese activity in this area of the United States, should double the cost of SI research.
The announcement of artificial intelligence published by various United States government agencies has been taken into account, although the US does not have an official SI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan, according to which they wanted to become the most innovative country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"At first we should double the budget for research on SI: all other countries are far away from the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area," Kai-Fu Lee said.
In his report this week, the CNBC also said that double funding could double the chance of another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published in this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the president of Synovation Ventures. The company invested in one of the most important companies in the art intelligence industry in China, known as Face+.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University on creating an SI system that won the best American player in the game Othello. He then took the lead in Microsoft Research and was the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognized the success of the previous American government's technological initiatives, such as the Agency's Advanced Research Projects in the Defence Area (DARPA) competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked the question of the next edition of the winnings, as he thought it would help her find future visionaries.
According to Kai-Fu Lee, researchers in the United States often have to make a lot of effort to receive government grants.
"It's not China that we get the best representatives of academic environments, but corporations," Lee said.
For several years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed excellent scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of SI.
"I think that people with artificial intelligence who have achieved a doctor's degree should automatically be granted a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council published a plan to create artificial intelligence for the next generation.
According to Lee, the Chinese National Foundation for Natural Science (National Natural Science Foundation of China) provides funding to members of academic institutions in a way close to the American National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations that grant American resources. However, the quality of academic activities in China is lower.
In the early part of this year, the United States Department of Defence called for a joint artistic intelligence centre (Joint Artificial Intelligence Center), which will engage in the work of partners from the world of industry and science. The White House announced instead the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence (Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
This month, DARPA also informed about the goal of $2 billion on the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than USD 100 billion per year in SI research.
At the same time, the American initiative aimed at creating a National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence from the month ahead did not take a step forward.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change in the name of their country
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum on the change of their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, allowing this movement to win a decade-long fight with Greece, which blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in the area where the historic province of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and has therefore failed to join the country to the EU and NATO.
In June, both governments reached agreement on the name of the country, but nationalists say that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of the Macedonian population.
President Iwanov said he would not take part in the vote. The campaign encouraging the boycott raised doubts as to whether the frequency would reach the minimum level of 50% required to recognize the binding referendum.
The referendum asked the following question: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU after the adoption of an agreement with Greece?"
The name changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is worth paying the price for the accession of Macedonia – one of the countries that has fallen after the fall of Yugoslavia – to organisations such as the European Union or NATO.
"I have voted in favour of my country's future so that young Macedonians can live free under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will provide us with greater security," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that it respects the results of the vote.
The change of name requires support from two thirds of Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission has informed that no unusual events have been recorded by 13 hours.
However, the frequency at this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections since 2016. The vote was 66%.
"I have voted in favour of my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Tanewski, a Scottish electorate.
On 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and his son Duszko voted in a referendum on the change of name of the country to open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union.
Prior to the construction of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small scene and set a chair for the rents distributed by the boycotting referenda.
"We support NATO and EU membership, but we want to join these organisations with the head of the Union, not the back door," Kawardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of European integration."
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments in Macedonia, with unemployment rates above 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will have to change the name of the referendum, because 80% of the citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that voting on "yes" is "the confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Public Studies, between 30 and 43% of voters declared their wish to participate in the referendum, which is less than the required frequency.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV Telma TV in Sunday's referendum, 57% of respondents are planning to vote.
70% of respondents found that despite the change in name.
In order for the vote to be successful, the frequency must be 50% + 1 vote.
The defeat in the referendum would be the first serious part of the Western government's policy since the holding of power last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City conquers the whole of Brighton's defense and gets the gate.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent Brighton's defense home at the weekend meeting ended with 2:0 for Manchester City. The match was played at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The branch acquired by Aguera in 65 minutes seemed to be childishly easy.
The action began from being given in the middle of the battle to the Argentine attacker.
The footballer raced three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was found among four Briggton champions.
First, he robbed one of them, then ran the rest and found himself on the roof of Brighton's criminal field.
That's when he played the ball to the left where he was waiting for Sterling.
The English assailant immediately gave the ball back to Aguery in the field of crime, who beat Brighton's cousin Mathew Ryan on the right side of the gate.
"Aguero fights the trail strike," the journalist told Coach Manchester City Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what happened.
We were lucky he got the gate at the time."
However, Sterling provided a blue first run in a single Premier League.
The door he's talking about fell in 29 minutes.
In the action of this Aguero, he got a ball deep in Brighton's half.
He sent a great deal along the left-hand side of the bowl to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move to a distant column.
The Manchester City attacker sent a ball to the net just before she got out of the car.
Manchester City will meet with Hoffenheim at the UEFA Masters League on Tuesday at 12:55. The meeting will take place at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to describe the chances of Rockies' victory
After losing the chance to participate in the play-off phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer, he didn't have to take the first stage.
However, fans of Scherzer's competition are hoping to take place at a Sunday meeting against Colorado Rockies, if only Rockies keep the chance to play-off. Currently the team has one more win from Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West Division.
Rockies can at least count on a wild card if they win a fifth meeting against the Nationals result 5:2. However, they still want to get their first title of the division master.
"Although we play "or nothing", at least we will go out to battle, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the appearance of opponents will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why would I not want to take part in this meeting?"
Nationals have not yet announced the starter of a Sunday meeting. However, the team agrees to show Scherzer in the first composition.
It would be the thirty-fourth show of Scherzer in the first composition. The winner took part in the Thursday throw training and is hoping to take part on Sunday.
The team's fair miner from Washington scored 18-7 and ERA 2.53. 300 times eliminated the bats and counted 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
Tromp Game in West Virginia
Trump did not refer simply to his nomination of Bretta Kavanaugh as Judge of the Supreme Court, discussing the importance of the frequency of Republicans in cases of half the presidential election.
"In November, we are putting all the achievements to the fore.
From one of the most important choices in our lives, we have been divided by five weeks.
Although I am not starting, I remain very active. I constantly arm our great candidates," he said.
He went on to say: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions in our own eyes.
They're determined to take power by any means they can, they're ugly and they're mean.
They do not regard those who are injured and those who must be wronged in order to gain power and control; and the extent of their power and control is their goal; and We will not give them this right.
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out the mission of "resistance and hard work".
"It has been very good to see this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "bad, evil, unpleasant and unfair."
The president referred to the Senate judicial committee, calling on the name and name of the American senator from the Democratic Party of Diane Feinstein, which met with a loud noise from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the outcome of the document?
"Uh, do I hear?
It was the worst speech I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant to those expressing its own opinion
When the Momentum members in my party voted in favour of my bribery, I wasn't surprised.
Finally, I am a member of the Group of Ambassadors of the Working Party, which has recently been told that they are not welcome, and that is all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan met with similar treatment because she was opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for a bribe was based on the differences between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, and, like irony, Jeremy Corbyn objected to the position of previous leaders on these issues.
In a Friday announcement on the meeting of the Labour Party parliamentarians from Nottingham East, we could read: "We want the meetings to be open and productive".
For eight years, the post office of the Labour Party, as I have been doing, was what most of the afternoon Friday meetings of the General Committee looked like.
Unfortunately, many meetings are taking place at a different time, and the promises of a "serious and gentler" policy have long been forgotten, as long as they have ever been remembered.
It is increasingly evident that the Party does not tolerate different views. Each opinion is assessed in compliance with the Party's leadership.
It all started shortly after Jeremy Corbyn's president's position began, and colleagues, who seemed to me to have similar views, began to expect me to change the direction and take the positions I would not agree with before, were concerned with issues such as national security or the single EU market.
After every public appearance, no matter what the content, I am meeting in the social media with attacks calling for the removal of the nominee, the contaminant or the abandonment of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I'm happier than some of my colleges, because the comments under my address have a better political character.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexual or racist treatment every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to the agenda with the insults of others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should support the culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views, and with every application for "infidelity" and every change in the principles of the party's choice of the world view is bound up.
Over the past two years, I have been repeatedly suggested that I do not go away and talk about certain issues, and then everything would be "okay".
But that's not why I took a policy.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student of the neglect of the Margaret Thatcher government, which led to my school break-up, I try to ensure better quality public services for those in need – both local councillors and ministers.
I never hid my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and knew about the differences of opinion with the party authorities.
To those who supported the fifth proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the President of the Labourers in the face of the approaching Brexit, which would harm the domestic economy, businesses and public services.
However, the most important thing is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud that I can serve you. I promise that no threats of cancellation of the nomination nor the clear political goals will deter me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr versus Melrose 38:17 – unrecognised Ayr again up
Two later additions were able to somehow eliminate the final result, but there is no doubt that the Air team won this extremely interesting game of shock extraligi.
The team was found in the first place in the table and remains the only unresolved team.
At the end, the distinctive defense and better use of the chance led the team of the economy to win. Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased with his underprivileged men.
“The earlier games were a challenge for us, but we are still imperfect, so I’m happy” he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose's team, said: "It is necessary to respect Air's commanders. They have better used the occasion than we have."
Ayr went to drive in 14 minutes after Grant Anderson's application and raised Frazier Clim. However, the yellow card for Rory Hughes's shot, who came to the team from the Glasgow Warriors team, allowed Melrose to match the result when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an unused chance to raise.
Climo increased Air's drive after the execution of the penalty, just before the end of the first half. First he got the landing, and later he used the chance to raise, getting the result 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose had a good start in the second half. Patrick Anderson's addition, raised by Baggot, reduced the loss to five points.
The game was then further suspended due to the serious contusion of Ruaridh Knott. The leader was removed from the bodice on his nose. After the resumption, Ayr increased the lead after the application of Stafford McDowall and the rise of Clima.
Ayr Blair Macpherson, the captain of the Ayr Macpherson team, has received a yellow card. Melrose has again used its number: adding with an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin has reduced driving.
The operators took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for the release of the Clim without a ball. MacPherson got the attachment on the back of the approaching defense.
Climo used the chance to raise, and then he managed to raise the result after re-playing the game, when Kyle Rowe caught a shot from the prison throw and allowed Gregor Henry's wing to win the fifth bet for the economy.
The Still Game series star starts a career in the gastronomic industry
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, appears to be starting business in the gastronomic industry. Recently it was discovered that he was the director of a restaurant management company.
The 56-year-old actor joined Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC station site. Hemphil and his multi-year comedy partner, Greg Hemphile, also appeared and collaborated.
Duet announced that the coming nine season will be the last in the series history. Everything points out that Ford Kiernan is planning the future after the release of Craiglang.
According to the official data, he was the director of the company Afringingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although the Scottish Sun informant suggested that Kiernan is trying to engage in the "developmental gastronomic industry" in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": the unavailable access to the Bolivian sea is a living hope that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the base of the Navy war in La Paz.
There are blue flags from public buildings.
At the port of the Lake Titicaca, the port of war, the Amazon, the motto is: “The sea is ours under the law.
His recovery is our duty."
In the unavailable access to the Bolivian sea, the mention of a shoreline lost to Chile in the bloody 19th century conflict of resources is still alive.
These hopes may be greater than a few decades. Bolivia expects the International Court of Justice ruling. It will be issued on 1 October after a five-year trial.
"The actions of Bolivia are taking a break. The residents are uniform, optimistically set and count on a favourable verdict," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will be jointly watching the International Court of Justice meeting. They hope that an organization based in The Hague recognises Bolivia's claim and after decades of free talks Chile will have to join the negotiations on granting independent access to the sea.
Here's Morales, charismatic president of Bolivia, who is going to stand up next year for an exciting reelection struggle, also puts hope in the Monday's decision.
"We are very close to the return to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
Some analysts say, however, that the chances for Bolivia’s benefit are small and that even a favorable decision would not change much.
The United Nations Office in The Hague has no authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. It also noted that it will not affect the establishment of possible talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law, the International Court of Justice decision will be issued six months after the submission of the final arguments.
Unfortunately, Bolivia has been able to distance the country from its destination for the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been addressed by the current Bolivian administration," said Paz Zárate.
The indiscriminate returnee Morales has deprived the Chileans of any remaining good will, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will once again talk, but it will be very difficult in the face of the present situation.
In the case of both countries, there has been no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz, former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, did not agree with the view that the court's decision-making process was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility to "end the 139-year period of disputes with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — used the subject of access to the sea as an element of political play.
"Bolivia never renounces the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is a great opportunity to make sure that we have to deal with the past."
North Korean leaders claim that nuclear disarmament will not occur until they can trust the United States.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, says that his people will never get rid of nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared at a time when the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to be on the verge of renewed nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims that the "mrzonka" is as if there was no lifting of the sanctions and the US's opposition to a declaration ending the Korean war had ever thrown North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to signing a declaration without the prior adoption by Pjongang of specific disarmament measures.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang seriously approaches the elimination of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only guarantee measure of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris' fashion shows show the latest line of big hats in clothing stores.
If you want to expand your collection of hats or totally hide in front of the sun, we have good information for you.
The fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy, over-recorded heads of their summer collection for 2019, which gleamed the style during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
Incredibly impractical chapels were on the Instagram of this year. These designers decided to present their misleading creations on the run.
The distinguished work of Valentino was a giant beige chapel decorated with a wide, pier circle that swirled the head of the models.
Other additional accessories included abrasions decorated with celeins, magic hats, and even pineapple — but they were not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of personal masks — during the same time on Halloween.
Many color masks had dark mouth and reminded of more Hannibal Lecter style than the high car.
One creation reminded the dive equipment with a tube and eyeglasses, and another looked like a dissolved ice.
And if you don't want to break up with a big fashion, you're lucky.
Style watchers provide that huge chapels can reach clothing shops.
The unparalleled chapels follow the "La Bomba", a broken chapel with a width of 61 cm, which has already been worn by all – from Rihanny to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand behind this unusually unpracticable chapel, which passed through social media, presented another great creation — a broken beach bag nearly as large as the model bearing it in the bathroom.
The oiled orange bag of rafia, filled with rafia fries and decorated with white leather hand, was distinguished in the collection Jacquemus La Riviera for the summer 2019 season during the fashion week Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, star designer, said FEMAIL: “I hope that large chapels and beach bags will appear in the shops next year — because the designer has been able to influence so much, it would be difficult not to use the demand for extra accessory”.
John Edward: Language skills needed for the world's citizens
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements — in 2018 they were able to welcome further significant results of exams, individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other social activities.
Representatives of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) schools, to which more than 30,000 students are enrolled throughout Scotland, aim to provide the best level of services provided to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, selected by them to pursue their careers and to demonstrate their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that has the ability to develop and implement a school-adjusted learning programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to a second person in the language he understands, then it will reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will reach his heart."
It is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last examination this year show that languages take the first place in league rankings, with the highest rates of inability for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have learned foreign languages have gained a higher score.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received higher A in Mandarin and 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as necessary skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Currently, language learning, as objects for choice, is conducted in the same area as STEM (solid sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in education programmes in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) showed that, for reasons of difficulty in hosting job vacancies, 17% of employers were unable to compete with language candidates.
Thus, increasing language skills become a necessity to prepare young people for the start of their career.
These skills are necessary in a globalised world at the growing number of jobs that require language skills,
Lifelong learning skills, such as learning a second language, will have a tremendous advantage in the future, regardless of the course of professional development.
The possibility of direct agreement with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of multilingual people in relation to competition.
According to a 2013 YouTube survey involving more than 4,000 British adults, 75% of them were unable to speak in a foreign language so well to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language whose percentage was two-digit, i.e. 15%.
Therefore, investing in the learning of foreign languages is so important for today’s children.
Knowledge of a number of languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children a greater chance of finding adequate employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in terms of the languages taught in it.
Many schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom in the perspective of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child’s interest, independent schools will always have many languages to choose from, which will be taught by specialized in this area by teaching staff.
Scottish schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to bring about success, regardless of what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that the international business environment still has a key role to play in the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
New languages should be treated as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish young people a great choice, diversity and level.
That's just right.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debt to the Lakers team on Sunday in San Diego.
Fani wanted to see LeBron James' debut in Los Angeles Lakers finally waited.
Luke Walton, coach of Lakers, announced that LeBron James played a Sunday pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
I don't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"More than one, but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers website.
The reporter of the Lakers team, Mike Trudell, on Twitter, announced that James was probably playing a incomplete number of minutes.
After training that took place at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-season Lakers matches.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to take part in pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trump election game in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight at Wheeling in West Virginia with a series of voters.
It's the first of the five set-ups planned by the Tromp of the election bells that will take place next week, along with the positions in friendly places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Along with a vote confirming that his election to hold a free position in the Supreme Trump court is seeking to build support in the forthcoming elections in the mid-term, as the Republicans may be threatened by a loss of control over Congress when the votes cast in November are cast.
What time is it going to be tonight to elect Trump in West Virginia, and where will it be possible to see him on the Internet?
Trump's election in Wheeling in West Virginia will take place today at 19:00, i.e. Saturday, 29 September 2018.
The more you choose Trump in West Virginia you will be able to follow live on the Internet on YouTube.
The Trump will probably refer to this week's hearings of candidates nominated to the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugha, who took place in a tense atmosphere due to allegations of improper sexual behaviour, as well as the expected vote in the Senate on the suspension of the election for a maximum period of one week, during the time of the FBI's investigation.
However, the main objective of this series of electoral rounds is to provide support to Republicans facing difficult November elections.
Thus, President Trump's five-year campaign next week aims to "mobilize volunteers and supporters to help Republicans protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives" — Reuters.
“Congress control is such an important point in the President’s timetable that, to the extent that the worst season of the campaign is approaching, he will visit as many states as possible,” said Trump’s spokesman, who did not grant permission to name him — Reuters.
Today's election in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the attention of the Pittsburgh media - West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit Virginia West — a state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia candidate to the Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisey, who loses in the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician from West Virginia University — Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Type of the United States shows the spirit of fighting, keeping hope for victory in Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the forum format that took place on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The growing wave of divorce is a completely invented concept of sports, but the one in which the rulers really believe, and the most in such professions as these.
So what do they look like at the moment?
"They've run six points, and now they're running only four, so I think we've got a little split," Jordan Spieth said.
Europe, of course, runs four points, while there are twelve more to be achieved.
The Americans, as Spieth says, however, feel the wind in their throats and have good patterns to follow, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them could boast of gaining three points out of four.
Speeth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
The screams on the whole throat, which is a sign of excitement, became louder during the course of his rounds, beating the key path and winning the match when he and Thomas got two holes in two attacks.
His return to the country that won the 15th prize met with a similar cry — one that makes it clear that the American team is still in the game.
"It's enough to focus and worry about your own match," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of each of these racers.
18 bucks to win.
The only players who in the last two days have gained a higher number of points than Speeth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unmistakable story of Ryder Cup.
Strange, but the lovely couple of the European team won four out of four and she didn't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't count the bogeys on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back on Friday morning.
The way in which the games and how their energy seems to flow both to, and from the violent crowd, proves that they have to be won on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could be a threat to the potential victory of the European team on Le Golf National.
It'd be best if they were playing on different dolls at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the early fourball hero when he was buried with Alex Noren.
The gods and the doubles on the front never dug Spain and Sweden into a hole from which they would never get out.
There's no one on Sunday who could help get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between the funds, the advice they provide, the advice they do not provide, and how the strategy can be changed at one time.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has taken a significant advantage on the last day, but the forum session also showed that the US team has been involved in a fight in which some, especially in the States, have doubted.
Europe with 10-6 results includes driving on the final day of Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after winning with the result of 10-6 Saturday fourball matches and foursomes with the United States.
Inspiring duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — he scored two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods, increasing his current score on Le Golf National to four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorna, trying to maintain the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an innocent American team in the early form of fourball, winning a 3-1 series.
The United States has made greater resistance in the form of foursomes, winning two matches, but they could not undo the loss.
To maintain the trophy, Jim Furyk team has to get eight points out of 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter to win four points in a row, while with Molinarim (the club called Molliwood after a sensational weekend) it is just a second couple in Ryder Cup history, which won four points in four opening matches.
After the fall of Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball format, they beat the embellished Woods and American debuter Bryson Dechambeau, getting an even more empathic score of 5&4.
Woods, who was bored by two matches on Saturdays, occasionally appeared to be brilliant, but lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourball and foursome formats, and that's seven out of a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the early fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format to win the 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cup – taking positions in the world rankings 1 and 3.
However, not all of the European teams thought of this pleasant, cold day in the field driven south-west of Paris.
The three-fold winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the point of reference for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won the 2&1 victory over Hispanic Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball format and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only two times in the history of Ryder Cup happened to make the team a four-point loss, starting with a single, although the Furyk team would only have a remix to keep the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, the weekly contract seems to be rather unlikely.
North Korea says "standby no" to one-sided armed without trust.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday during a UN statement that the absence of sanctions only deepens the lack of confidence in North Korea in the United States and there is no way that the country unilaterally renounces nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the Annual General Meeting that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" last year, such as supporting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we do not see any specific response from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security and, in such circumstances, there is no mention of the unilateral disarmament of North Korea."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's lack of a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual action, its statement seemed to be significant because it did not reject one-sided denuclearization, as was the case in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in the first history of the summit between the official president of the United States and the leader of North Korea, which took place on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un committed himself to working for the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", and Trump promised the security guarantees of North Korea.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean war (from 1950 to 1953), but the United States representative announced that Pjongang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington also supported calls for the relief of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States is obliged to "declare in the first order" and to increase pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a forceful manner, even in opposition to the signing of "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The fact that sanctions can put us on our knees is a stink of people who behave in relation to us in an ignorant way.
The problem, however, is that the absence of the abolition of the sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, mentioned at the beginning of the week by the United States leader at the UN Forum.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and the leader of South Korea Moon Jae-in over the last five months, and added: "If the party on denuclearization was South Korea, not the United States, then there was no such impasse in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was completely different compared to the last year when he said during the UN General Assembly that the elimination of North Korea missiles in the United States territory was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim Jong Una "rocket man" (a rocket man) on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN Trump Forum, which threatened the "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim Jong Un for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but also said that there was still a need to put a lot of work on the ground, and also said that until North Korea is free of nuclear weapons, sanctions will not be lifted.
In the middle of Trump said he did not appoint a time zone, saying: “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months — it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council Forum: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue and be constant until we find a full, final and verified denuclearisation".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea, trying to slow down the financing of the nuclear programme and the Pyongyang ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly Forum and later said he would visit Pjongang again next month as part of preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, after which a few hours North Korea had condemned him for "getting gangster demands".
North Korea committed itself this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in, that it would disassemble the site for testing missiles and a nuclear complex if the United States took appropriate measures.
He stated that Kim Jong Un told him that "responsible measures" to which he was concerned were security guarantees to ensure that Trump was committed to Singapore and that he was taking steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course on adequate long rest
The new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, provided all students with more dreams, aimed at combating the growing culture of macho, which is taught by “all night students driven by caffeine”.
Students from the best university in the world often have no idea of the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of this type in the United States.
To create a course, he was inspired by his speech about the impact of sleep depression on science.
"After the talk, one girl came to me and said, "Why am I saying this right now when I'm in my last year of study?"
She found that no one ever told her about the meaning of my dream, which surprised me," The Telegraph said.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, students learn how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in science and sports and improve the overall feeling of students.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the Health Service, said that this course was decided to be introduced after it was found that students suffered severe sleeplessness during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of a room in the academy where students click on the cupboards, screens, exercises and books to get information about the effect of caffeine and light and how a lack of sleep affects sports results, and how it is important to keep the regularity of sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this does not lead to an immediate change in the behaviour of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride from "all night science" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students mean a growing problem of lack of sleep.
Ensuring a sufficient amount of good quality sleep should be a "secret weapon" for students combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even avoiding weight loss, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go through hunger, which makes the student constantly hungry — he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler to develop a course after taking part in one of his last year's activities in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press the course for the entire campus.
The next step is to invite all students of postgraduate studies to complete a similar programme of studies before going to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up a reminder alarm when to go to sleep and when to get up, and that they be aware of the harmful effect of the "blue light" emitted by electronic devices and LED lighting that can spread the daily rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga helps the Gerrard team
The Rangers again suffered during a fight to get out in Livingston, when Dolly Menga had his shot led to the failure of Steven Gerrard's disassembled team, achieving the result of 1-0.
The team of the Ibrox Stadium wanted to record their first victory from the February 4-1 victory over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard in 18 matches, causing for his team a difference of eight points with regard to leader Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga shot naked seven minutes before the end of the first hunt, and the Rangers' composition showed a lack of commitment didn't seem to improve.
While Rangers scored a sixth, Livingstone scored third — just for Hibernian with one goal.
The Rangers may have further difficulties as a result of the need to have the head wound of Judge Caluma Spence's line after he has been hit by the object thrown out of a guest's tent.
Gerrard introduced eight changes to the team, which allowed him to sell Air and go to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt, on the other hand, went through with the same eleven-year-old Livingstone, who took the point of the Hearts team last week, and was fascinated by the way his well-trained team had tortured every step of its opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but the Livingston team did more with the ball when they got it.
They were supposed to get naked in just two minutes when the first release of the ball through Meng allowed Scott Pittman to go with the gate of Allan McGregor, but the assistant didn't use his chance.
Next Keaghan Jacobs addressed the deep free shot to Captain Craig Halket, but his colleague Alan Litgow, who played in the defense position, could only remain in the back position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quadrant, but it seemed as if they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos surely believed that he was supposed to throw the penalty for fifteen minutes before the end of the game, when he and Steven Lawless fell on himself, but Judge Steven Thomson had developed the Colombian claim.
The Rangers were able to deliver only two customs shots in the first half, but they were the cousin of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, barely worried about Lassany Coulibaly's head, and I was weakly shot by Ovie's Ejaria.
While Livingston's 34-minute goal of opening the match could be the opposite of the game over, no one can deny that they earned it for the effort put into it.
The Rangers again failed to deal with the deep, solid piece of game by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher threw a ball into Scott Robinson, who kept it calm, giving it to Mengi to just finish the action.
Gerrard did not leave the room and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. This change almost immediately had an effect on the wing that threw the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it, getting it from his position.
Livingston's type continued to attract guests to the game exactly as they liked when Lithuania and Halkett performed a long time after each other.
The Holt team could have increased the lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor stood well in front of Jacobs, after which Litgow took the game away from the counter.
The Rangers Reserve, Glenn Middleton, had another hope for the execution of the prison when he and Jacobs broke up, but Thomson turned his eyes back.
Almanac: Founder of Geiger
And now a page of our Sunday Morning edition, Almanac: September 30, 1882 — 136 years ago... the day that the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as Geiger's.
Since then, Geiger has become both an element of science and pop culture, such as in the movie "Bells of Coronado" of 1950, in which you have had very little chance of cobblers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What is wrong with this?"
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s computer that is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these hearing aids, you'll hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: "Now hear something!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survived to this day.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "warn" cell enemy.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "warn" the enemy cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to detect cell enemies in the course of treatment.
This method is used to separate the immune cells from the patient and to transform them into the laboratory.
Then they can "see" the protein in common for many new products, and then they are re-injected into the body.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of tumours.
In one woman who was treated with a vaccine, a resistance system was found to recognize the cell’s foetuses for more than 18 months.
The method is to separate the resistant cells from the patient, to change them into the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein in common for many new ones called HER2 and then inject the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that this vaccine is very good".
HER2 "stirring the growth of several types of innovations", including breast, egg, lung and fat, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the collection of resistant cells from patients and the "learning" of their location of tumour cells has contributed to the treatment of some type of protein.
Kanye West runs a pro-trump diet in the Saturday Night Live program — with the MAGA head.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was "excited" at the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after the President of the United States, Donald Trump, praised and said he was going to apply for the office in 2020.
After this night's performance of his third titled Ghost Town, during which he had a hat with the title "Make America Great", he made a statement against the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people all the time, and I hear, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
If I cared about racism, I would have been out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star praised Bretta Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judicial commission on sexual assault charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although he was not broadcast, the video from West was sent to social media by the comicist Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock wanted to smack West by replacing the post.
In addition, West complained to the public that behind the scenes he had problems with his hat.
"They took me behind the scenes.
They said I wouldn't go out with that hat on my head.
They took care of me!
And then they say I don't have a way out," said Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you say I don't have a way out?" adding, "I'm going to put on a superman's bell, so you won't be able to tell me what I'm going to do.
Let's accept it."
His words caused a double "breath" of the public, and members of the SNL teams seemed to be in trouble, bringing in Variety.
West was invited to the program in place of the songwriter Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West questioned a lot of performance I Love it in the washing of Perrier's water bottle.
West received support from TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: "To one of the most courageous: JOIN THE MAFIL'S REPRESENTATION".
The leader of Karen Hunter's show on Twitter said that the West was simply "and it's absolutely wonderful".
"But I'm NOT going to reward people (by buying their music or clothes or by supporting their "stuffs") who, I think, also accepts a broad ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we free," she added.
Before the rapper program, he announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that now it's "formally called Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name — he follows Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed the name to symbol, and then the artist known as Prince.
Trying to kill a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
This happened in Ballyhackamore when the police arrived.
The defendant is to stand before the Greek court in Belfast on Monday.
The officers will be examined by the prosecution.
Star Games of the throne Kit Harington moves the toxic matter of man
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the mid-term HBO series "Game of throne".
The 31-year-old actor struck the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen causes young boys to often think they have to play hard to be respected.
In his interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit found that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the toxic problem of man in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married her partner from the throne game plan, the 31-year-old actor Rose Leslie, admitted that she felt "too sure", moving this issue.
“ Personally, I feel pretty sure at this moment — where did we make mistakes on the subject of manhood? ” he said.
"What did we teach men when they were growing up, looking at the perspective of the problem we are currently dealing with?"
Kit believes that for the development of toxic manhood, television may be partly responsible for the presentation of very male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are born, and what is taught?
What is he learning on television and on the streets, what makes young boys start to think they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think it is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change it?
Clearly, it's not all right with young men."
He also found that he did not play in any prequel or sequel games of the throne after the series ended next year, saying that he “end with the fields of battles and horses”.
Since November Kit will play in the art "True West" Sam Shepard, which is a story about a film producer and his brother – a thief.
The actor recently stated that he considered knowing his wife, Rose, the best thing that happened to him in Grieve's throne.
"I met my wife on the plan, which provided me with my future family and a new life," he said.
In this award-winning series of Rose’s fantasy series, Emmy played Ygritte — an object of great interest in the character of China, Jon Snow.
Para took place in June 2018 on the territory of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China accounts for a 14-percent increase in new cases
The Chinese reported a 14-percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this problem, as the health services of the country provide.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
A determined majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which means change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of a transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost completely reduced, as Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 per year.
The transmission of HIV by sex is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT people is widespread.
In view of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually get married to women.
Many cases of transmission of the disease are due to insufficient safety during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters objected to the fact that one of her team members revealed data from the Senators of the Republican Party — "hazardous lies" and "theory of the list".
A member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, dropped charges on Saturday as if her team had put the personal data of three Republican senators on Wikipedia's side of the legislators.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party has ensured that these charges have been filed by experts and websites related to the "ultra-corrective wings".
"Truths, lies, and even more worthless lies," Waters reported on Twitter.
Public information also included home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. She was placed by an unknown person in the Capitol during a panel in the Senate on charges of sexual misconduct directed against the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The election took place some time after the candidacy of Kavanaugh by three senators.
Conservatives, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the mail source was related to the Waters office and published information about a member of the Waters team — as Hill says.
"This unsub is totally false and is a hundred percent lie," Waters continued.
“A member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security were violated as a result of these misleading and false accusations — was not in any way responsible for the outcome of this information.
This baseless trap is totally false and it's a hundred percent lie."
The Waters statement quickly provoked criticism on the Internet, including by Ari Flescher, a former press spokesman for the White House.
"That way of denying is evil," Flescher wrote.
“It suggests that she does not have the right temper to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he can't be angry.
He can't provocate.
He cannot question the motives of the accused.
He must keep peace for this."
Fleischer seemed to compare the Waters reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of showing excessive anger during a Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate starting in mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"The rough case, if it's true," he wrote on the Tweeter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed “the competent authorities and the prosecution authorities of these fraudulent charges”.
"The rapporteurs will be disembarked and drawn to legal responsibility for all their actions that pose a threat to any member of my team," she announced.
Review by Johnny English: Nokaut - Spiel parody with weak Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in every new film with a British thread has already become a standard. It seems to apply in the case of a new part of a series of films from the action and comedy "Johnny English", which started in 2003 from the film "Johnny English" and which returned to the cinema screens in 2011 with the film "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Will the self-regulatory satire about how hopeless we are become a new export commodity?
In any case, always surprised, characterized by a rubber face, the incompetent Johnny English has again received a license for sharing — his name and name more than anything else signals that he is a built-in comical production for non-English-language vision.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent, who despite his strange tastes for smooth glamour has a little detail from Inspector Clouseau, Jasi Fasoli's strain and a cap of this guy adding one necessity to the lead character of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In the past he was also a traveler and a world mystery man — Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, where he was left with chaos.
The most recent film in the Johnny English series is one or two moments worth of attention.
I was very pleased with the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval weapons, while his helmet had rhythmically hit the blades of a helicopter.
On the screen you can clearly see the gift of Atkinson for the physical play of comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low and unnecessary, especially that currently also "serious" film brands, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, offer comedy elements as part of the film composition.
The humorous elements seem to be directed rather to children rather than adults — according to me, the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not as creative and consistent as the gagas in his non-Atkinson films about Jasi Fasoli.
From an ever - present point of view, it is that the United Kingdom has serious problems.
Cyberhacker moves to the British superintendent network of spies, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the field — to the fear of the agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
It's the last drop in the burning magic of the prime, which is a delicate, depleted figure already and so suffering as a result of a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in her power, focusing on the character of Theresy May, but the script does not give her the opportunity to develop wings.
Her consultants from the intelligence agency inform her that due to the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And this means that Johnny English is disabled in his own person, currently employed as a teacher in some elegant school, giving unofficial lessons about how to become a secret agent — a few bad gagas during the teaching of spying by English.
English is invited to Whitehall to resign, re-connecting with his former assistant Bough, bordered again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a man associated with the commander of a submarine — a cheerful but somewhat tired figure played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin share in the secret service of Her Royal City are returning to action, meeting beautiful women fatally Ophelia Bulletin, being played by Olga Curylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of being ruled by a charismatic technological billionaire who claims that he can solve the computer problems of the United Kingdom — he is the villain Jason Volt, bordering Jake Lacey.
English and Bough are starting their crucifixion from the absurd situation: dressed as waiters are fueling the French restaurant; they introduce chaos, turning on the luxury boat of Volty; and English is starting to sink when using the set to virtual reality to read the inside of Volty's house.
In this last episode, all restrictions are gone, but despite the kind and humorous performance, the whole film is a great reminder of television for children.
A typical medium.
Like other films in the Johnny English series, I couldn't resist the idea: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really correspond to his talent?
The working party rejects as if it was drawing up a plan for the British for a four-day work week for which they receive a five-day remuneration
The work of Jeremy Corbyn will consider introducing a radical plan that will allow the British to work for four days a week, receiving a five-day remuneration.
The party also wants the company's bosses to pass on to the workers the savings obtained through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, giving them an additional day off.
With this, the employees could enjoy the weekend, getting the same amount of pay.
The sources suggest that this idea "will be included" in the economic programme of the parties and plans of departure of the country against workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way of using workers to change the economy.
The senior member of the Labour Party in the discussion with The Sunday Times said: "It is expected that a policy change will be announced before the end of this year."
"This will not happen from day to day, but the four-day work week is something that is reflected in the party's approach to restoring economic balance for the benefit of the employee, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party committed itself to introducing a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, these plans are currently not supported by all the members of the Working Party.
The Party Party's spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not a party policy and its introduction is not considered by it."
John McDonnell, the Office of the Shadow, used the last week's conference of the Working Party to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless directors" and "speculators" in public utility companies.
The Chancellor's plans from the shadow office also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover their full share, as the Labour Party's government could carry out "recognitions" on the basis of proven abuses.
He also confirmed the plans for the placement of employees in company administrations and the creation of integrated own funds to transfer 10 per cent of own funds to private employees who receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy respond in the 60-minute program to whether the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh can make them change their attitude.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least a week and has raised questions as to whether the establishment of the office of inquiry could allow the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday, Scott Pelley will be conducting a 60-minute program asking Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find something that could lead to a change in their settings.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened when the drop appeared, and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was stable, determined and consistent."
However, Graham's opinion seems to be thrown into a rock.
"I made a decision about Bretta Kavanaugh and, to change it, it needs a strong commitment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it," Graham added, turning to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the people who gave it could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything's gonna change."
What is the event of the Global Citizen Festival and whether or not has contributed to the reduction of poverty?
On the next Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival will be held, an annual music event that can honor itself with an extremely impressive composition of stars and an equally impressive mission — the elimination of poverty in the world.
The seven Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of the stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the realization of the most important goal of this event, which is the liquidation of the year 2030 of extreme poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Powery Project, an international group working to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless they decided to purchase a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the world leader, making a phone call or other significant activities to help raise awareness about the purpose of eliminating poverty.
But what success can the Global Citizen have in the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of awarding free people a concert a good way to convince them to take action, or is it another case called “clickivism” when people feel they are doing something important by signing an online petition or posting a Twitter entry?
The Global Citizen said that since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded by people who support the action, seeking to achieve many different goals.
It also states that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce their commitments and provisions of over 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group committed 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, in which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The Group considers that the measures in question have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, the British partnership of investors and contractors involved in "helping children to achieve their full potential", which promised to transfer Rwande $35 million to help eliminate the malnutrition in that country, after Global Citizens sent more than 4700 tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens, such as you, we can make social injustice, which is a lack of experience, go back to history" — Tracey Ullman, Ambassador Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 activities calling for the UK to improve the quality of mother and child nutrition, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which reaches up to 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
For one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which sounded "Why are you sure that extreme poverty can be eliminated?",
The Global Citizen responded: “This will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will run and deal with defeats.
But just as in the case of the more recent major movements towards civil rights and the fight against apartheid, we will be successful because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the stars that take place this year in New York, whose economies will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use a military navy to block Russian energy exports — Internal Affairs Secretary
Washington may "if necessary" flee to its military mariner to prevent the flow of Russian energy to the markets, including those in the Middle East, has revealed the Secretary of Home Affairs of the United States, Ryan Zinke, Washington Examiner.
Zinke maintained that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government — is a pretext for the exploration of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is the desire to trade energy, as in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, on behalf of its military mariners, has the opportunity to make sure that the sea routes remain open and, if necessary, to create a blockade to ensure that their energy is not found on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that itself defines itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is less focused on the use and substitution of fuels," he said, comparing Russia to a "silver with the economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements were made at a time when Trump's administration continued its mission, with the aim of increasing the exports of greenhouse gas to Europe, which is much cheaper for European consumers than for Russian gas.
To this end, Trump's officials, including President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "non-use" Nord Stream 2 project, which according to Trump made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 gas station, worth 11 billion dollars, which is intended to double the existing capacity to 110 billion metres, is a project of an economic nature only.
Kreml argues that Washington's jealous opposition to the implementation of this project is purely economical and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after meeting with the US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States led to a violent reaction by Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation of Germany, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think it is a big problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angeli Merkel and Russian Prime Minister Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said he would consider running for the president in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday that after the mid-term elections he would consider running for the president.
During a meeting in Holyoke in Massachusetts Warren, she confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair the corrupt government. This is also the case for women with the highest rank," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will consider my candidacy as President."
At Warren's meeting, she mentioned President Donald Trump, saying that he is "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren without a garden expressed her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh.
On Friday on Twitter, Warren wrote, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, published on Thursday, the poll showed that most of Warren's voters do not believe that they should apply in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters choosing the option "probably" said that the senator should not apply for the results of the survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy — 38 percent of the people supported his potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed it.
Other well-known names from the democratic camp were taken into account in terms of potential candidates in 2020: Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, as the Associated Press gave.
Sarah Palin talks about the peer stress team (PTSD) Track Palina during the election age Donald Trump
Track Palin (26 years) spent a year in Iraq after taking up military service in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What goes on with my own son, through which he must go back, I understand other families that feel the effects of PTSD and the wound that our soldiers are returning with," said the public at the election age of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest of her son “the subject of taboo”, after which she said about her son and other war veterans: “They return a little changed, return a bit, return, wonder whether respect will be shown for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and all other members of the army have given to their country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilli in Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, urged to file false testimony in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of shock, as Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilli Police Department.
18 states and the District of Colombia support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge for the new United States policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing the gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts put in Washington on Friday a list of friends who are curious to support an asylum-seeker who wins this policy — as the NBC News reports.
The full name of the reason for Grace v. Sessions, which American Civil Liberties Union organised in August against federal politics, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his brutal sons from the gang" were proud of her, but the American officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
She's been detained in Texas.
The prosecutors of the states supporting Grace described Salwador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries struggling with common gang problems and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy violated the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Colombia, said in a Friday statement that the new policy "is ignoring the existing ten-year state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle", as stated in the list of friends of the Curie.
The prosecutors further argued in the letter that the policy of refusing entry to immigrants would harm the United States economy, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and "be a necessary labour force".
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered the immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims who were fleeing from domestic violence and the gangs.
"Assil is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on the grounds of racial, religious, national or belonging to a particular social group or having such other political convictions," Sessions said in its statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
Asylum never intended to solve all the problems — even those serious — that people from all over the world struggle with every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Paul in a situation where the number of victims doubled in a race aimed at finding survivors
For the survivors, it became increasingly tragic.
"This is a very intense feeling," said 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, comforting her divorced son at the evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance imports the body.
There's no clean water."
Residents were seen returning to destroyed homes, searching for watered things, and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees, were quickly filled.
Some of the wounds, including the two Haris, who had suffered from vertebral fractures and limbs, were restless in a hospital in Pala, where patients were treated outside due to severe secondary shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears, as he spoke of a violent earthquake on the ground, which shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
I think I was pushed into the Romanian wall" — Harris said Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for marriage.
"I heard my wife asking for help, after which her voice was silenced.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
Ambassador of the United States accuses China of "suffering" advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-sided advertisement in an American newspaper that boasts mutual benefit from the US-China trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China’s Daily supplement in Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — accusing China of attempting to interfere with the United States Congress, which will be held on November 6th — China objected to this charge.
Zaruzut Trump about Pekin trying to get to the U.S. elections, confirmed what US officials told the Reuters agency that it was a new step in escalating the campaign by Washington to create pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently conducting a escalating trade war that has led to the increase in customs duties on mutual imports.
The Chinese tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to affect exporters in such states as Iowa, who supported the Republican Trump Party — Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China, and former governor of the state of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had caused injury to US workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in the article in the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register that China “now starts with a double force by placing propaganda advertisements in our own free press”.
"In expanding its propaganda, the Chinese government is using a respected American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
For this reason, there will be no opposition votes on the street in Beijing and no real reflection of the divergent opinions that Chinese can have on China's worrying economic direction, given that the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most well-known Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans react to the mid-term elections of women with the right to vote by the Kavanaugh affair, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans support and weapons nominated to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh in the face of several charges of sexual assault, the analyst warns that your members are meeting during the upcoming mid-term elections with a violent response, especially on the part of women.
The emotions associated with this event are extremely large, and most Republicans are already officially willing to vote.
"That's not enough," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts as to whether Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizona's) efforts to conduct a recent investigation by the FBI were enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget this morning and they will not forget it until November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national developer of the MoveOn group – as the newspaper published in Washington.
On Friday morning, the protesting scandals came up with the word "November", demonstrating at the Senate Hall because of the decision by the Republicans controlling the Judicial Commission to refuse to award Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as Mic said.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation goes beyond the scale," said one of the information pages of Stu Rothenberg, an endless political analyst.
“People say that he was already tall — and that is true.
But it may be higher, especially among undecided women of prejudice and younger voters from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before the Ford public hearing, in which she described in detail her allegations of sexual assault addressed to the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republic had decided to approve the candidacy, it could have a violent reaction.
"The Republican Party must deal with a small mess," said at the beginning of last week, Michael Steele, the president of the Republican National Committee, as the NBC News reports.
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it is also the way in which the Republic has dealt with this situation and how they treated Ford," said on one of Guy Cecil's information channels, Director of Priorities USA, a group that assists in the election of Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be a bit divided into those who believe in the face of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more support.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent found that they believed in Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents found that Kavanaugh was likely or probably lied when reporting, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After press release by Flake, the FBI began an investigation into the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, as The Guardian, reports.
Ford testified last week under an oath before the Judicial Commission that Kavanaugh under the influence of alcohol attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez argues that the nominated to the Supreme Court showed her genitalia during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The manufacturer of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Team Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, launches startups that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform — Solid — owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to specific information.
In an exclusive statement for Fast Company Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of creating Inrupt was "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," he said, referring to the start.
"The historic moment has come."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own "internet with personal data" or other POD.
It can contain contact lists, mailing lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of the Internet store with personal data is that the user fully depends on who has access to what information.
The company calls it "the personal satisfaction through data".
According to the president of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
Currently, Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, which from day to day leads to turning up all their business models.
"Don't ask for permission."
On Saturday on the Medium-Lee platform, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a lot of discussions on network neutrality.
Calling for life Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely excited to think of the next era in the development of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Marking the spiritual Victorian Cross during World War I
The memory of the only spiritual Church of England, which in World War I as a combatant was marked by the Victorian Cross, was taught 100 years later in its family town.
Major Bernard Vann was appointed on September 29, 1918 for the event at Bellenglier and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he was marked by the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandsons discovered a monumental stone during a parade in Rushden in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that the discovery of the stone exactly in the century was “a very symbolic character”.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vann's Plc led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very dense crowd and under a strong bulge of field and machine guns".
He then hurried to the line of fire and with “the greatest courage” led her to move forward, after which he individually launched an attack on the position of the fields, destroying three of them.
The army of Vann was killed by the German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72 years) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never be able to do, but at the same time be humble”.
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, he was sentenced to death by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored, able to take part in paradise” and added that “the courage of a true hero appears in the support he receives from many people”.
Fani MMA didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, instead, get the Pepcha Pig.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to look at the galla Bellator 206 packed with emotion and can't finally see the main fight.
The program could contain 13 races in San Jose, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mouusas and Rory MacDonald prepared to fight, the visions in the United Kingdom were shaken by a change in the program for Peppa.
Some were disappointed when they didn't sleep in the early hours of the morning, especially to see this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the replacement for children as "a sick joke".
"In accordance with the Government's regulation, the content of this type is inadequate so that it can be released at 6 a.m., which required a change in the programme for children," said Dave Schwartz, the senior vice president of Bellator's marketing and communication, when asked for a transmission.
"Peppa pig, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they're working on a timetable to take into account future visions from the United Kingdom.
"When I think of a repeat situation, I think we can fix it," Coker said.
"But it's Sunday 6th morning, so we won't be able to cope with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed there, we were asleep in a mass of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical shock.
But it wasn't just a matter of law.
I can promise you that this situation will not happen again.
We're going to limit the program to five fights instead of six, which is to the standard amount.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt worse because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jump, says he grew up feeling worse than anyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to bring success.
24 years old said he didn't realize that they weren't all like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs radio 4 station, Lauren Laverne said he was talking about gay rights to give another "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned with winning the Olympics.
The usual leader of this program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to the disease.
As he appeared in the program for the first time led by Laverne, Daley said that as he grew up, he felt "less valuable" than others, because "the same thing about boys and girls was not socially acceptable".
He said: “To this day, this feeling of inferior worth and being different is something that gives me the strength to cope with success. ”
He said he wanted to prove that he was “something worth” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
A twice-brown Olympic medalist became a vocal player in the LGBT community and used his speech in the present-day National Community Games in Australia to appeal to a larger number of countries for the decriminalization of homosexuality.
He said he decided to express himself because he felt happy, he could live open, without any involvement, and so he wanted to give another "hope".
The three-time world champion said that in love with a man — American filmmaker Dustinie Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — he “stumbled. ”
Daley got married to an Oscar winner (who is 20 years old from him) last year, noting that this age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you go through so many times in such a young age” – he meant his first 14-year-old Olympics and his father’s death three years later because of cancer – he said it was hard for him to find someone at the same age who experienced similar strokes and falls.
The couple stayed in June with the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his perception of certain things had completely changed.
"The most important thing for me last year was to get a gold medal," he said.
"You know what? It's more important than the golden Olympic medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was whether he had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 — he wanted to take the lead.
"I couldn't tell him, "he won't be with us to be in the first order, Dad," he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing. Just when he stopped breathing and died, I understood that he was not weak” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — jumping into water before the crowds in the Olympics — it was the best feeling possible,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — The Water Small, which accompanied him in the preparations for the Olympic Games and which continues to make him a ghastly skin.
Desert Island Disks program is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Displaying a lack of Mikkelson's shape on the bench during the Saturday part of Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday, when it plays its 47th match at Ryder Cup, but it will have to work on its form so that it doesn't cancel its Friday.
Mikkelson, who played for a twelve-time event every two years, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as was often the case in his case in the United States team, the five-time main winner had to spend the day working on the team and working to improve his game in order to correct the cause of his being sent to the bench.
The 48-year-old, who never gave up the simplest hits, even at the peak of his career, is not well tested in the narrow Le Golf National field, on which the wrong hits are irrefutablely punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not encouraging enough for Mikkelson, on Sunday's ninth game, he has to face the exact winner of the British Open — Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with the debutor Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If America (with the loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) starts the game with a worm, the Mickelson match may prove to be extremely key.
Fury expressed confidence in his champion — he could not do anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, stuck me behind his back, hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"He's very sure of himself.
He is in the gallery of fame and has led many of his teams to the game both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was playing two games.
I thought they'd be more, but that's how it turned out, and that's how we had to do.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else."
Mickelson wins Nick Faldo's record on Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mean the end of his career at Ryder Cup, which never matched his individual achievement.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 wins, and seven awards. Fury said his presence led a lot to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, smart, funny and it's good to have it in the team room," he explained.
"I think young players were having a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He's bringing his person a lot more than just a game."
Captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that a great deal of score can be short
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point of view before the start of the singles on the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in the Valderram field, where, along with his associate Vice-Captain Seve Ballesteros, he had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the line of the year passed at the shortest of the possible hairs, winning 141 1⁄2-131⁄2.
"Don't forget that we had a great advantage over the Valderram field; we also had a great advantage over the Brookline field, where we lost, and in the case of Valderram we won only by hair," Bjorn said, in his photo, after winning 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, which led 10-6 on the Le Golf National field.
The time will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
You'll get everything out of you tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
The end will only be when the points appear on the table.
We have a goal that is to win the trophy, and we need to focus on it.
From the beginning I said that I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know well who are on the opposite side — the best players in the world."
Bjorn, fascinated by the hard work his leaders had done, added: “I would not do that better.
But tomorrow is different.
They start single tomorrow, and that's another question.
It's good to play with a partner when everything comes to mind, but when you play in a single game, your edge skills in the golf course are tested to the limit of possibilities.
It's a message that we need to pass on to the players, and it's gonna give you everything tomorrow.
The partner also has to give everything."
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Fury will expect his winners to achieve better results in a single game than in games with a partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points from four.
Sam Furyk experienced a major return to last day's action as a member of the victory team in the Brookline field, after which he failed as the European team did "a miracle in the Medina field".
"I remember every word," he said in his answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, was warming up to fight his champions on the last day.
"We're playing 12 important games tomorrow – you'd like to start the game at a quick pace, as was the case in Brooklyn and Medina fields.
If this floor goes one way, it's gonna be a lot of pressure on the mid-games.
We set up our composition and set up the boys in a way that would allow us to enjoy tomorrow."
Thomas was entrusted with the task of carrying out the contract, with the lead of Rory McIlroy in the main match, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmo, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other European team leaders in the middle of the programme.
"I've decided on this group of guys in this order, because I think he's gonna be able to handle all the games," Bjorn said about his single choices.
New German warship again late
The most recent frigate of the German Navy should be used in 2014 to replace the old warships of the winter, but this will not happen until at least next year because of bad arrangements and rising costs at an alarming rate — as local media have.
The use of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was moved to the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit reported, referring to the words of the military spokesman.
The ship should be included in the warship in 2014, but changes in this ambitious project had to be made to the problems that emerged after delivery.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg units ordered by a military marine in 2007 will replace the old Bremen frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped in a powerful piece, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft prints, as well as technological solutions to prevent detection, including reducing radar, sub-red and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer periods between conservations — the operation of new bridges should be possible even for two years from the maternal ports.
However, further delays mean that these modern warships, which are intended to enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will become obsolete at the start of the service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the first pages of the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to give up the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Station in Hamburg.
It was the first time a Navy warship turned the ship back to the yard after the delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons behind the return, but the German media reported a number of key "software and equipment errors" that made the ship useless in the war mission.
In particular, software errors were important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 mariners, about half the size of the Bremen class.
It has also proved that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its achievement and limits the possibility of a future modernization by the Navy.
It is considered that the 7000 tonnes of the Rhineland-Palatinate ship is twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the problem also becomes the cost of the whole project — including staff training.
It is said to have reached a level of EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion), while the initial cost was EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the use of new fractals are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings of the fact that the force of the German fleet is burning.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, admitted that sailors "will end up capable of being used".
He also said that this problem had increased over time as a result of the withdrawal from operation of the old units without the provision of replacement vessels.
In addition, he expressed his discontent with the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could be included in the Navy fleet.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of the Netoper
The new research carried out in the area of the Highlands is aimed at showing how the bats use landscapes during food production.
The results of the studies are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these exceptional mammals and to help direct future actions to protect them.
Studies conducted by researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will be conducted in the case of post- and small cartilage, as well as long-eared brown netopers and netopers from the Inverewe Gardens family in Western Ross.
Special registries will be placed in key locations around the seat to monitor the activity of the netoper.
NHS workers and volunteers will also conduct field studies using portable detectors.
The purpose of the expert audio analysis is to determine the frequency of the signals sent by the netoper and how to maintain the individual species.
The map and the report will then be developed to create a detailed image of their landscape-wide behaviour.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Nature Protection Adviser, hopes that the results are public, which are the most important areas for the netoper and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits arising from the management of landfills, e.g. the creation of ponds, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, the population of Netoper has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that have an impact on the capitals and the loss of the capital.
Wind turbines and lighting installations may also pose a threat, as well as fungi on flies and some chemical substances used in building materials and even domestic cats.
The bats aren't really that blind.
However, because of nightly fishing habits, their ears are more helpful than the eyes in the catch.
They use the complex echolocation technique to search for abrasions and obstacles on their way.
The NTS organisation, which is responsible for the care of over 270 residential buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, grid checks, and sometimes even rescue actions.
The organisation has set up even the first and only non-topper reserve in Scotland in the area of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten Scottish species of non-topper.
David Thompson, the owner of the estate, says she's for the untoppered ideal territory.
"Threave has an excellent area for netopers," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and famous settlements.
However, there are still many who are not aware of the netoper. The work we do here and in other settlements will help us to understand what they need to develop."
It underlines the importance of monitoring the presence of netoper in the presence of pre-reservation work in the holdings, as the accidental destruction of one mine may kill up to 400 males and young people, which may lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
The netopers are protected — their killing, beating or stumbling them, and their destruction is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a shock officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged public opinion to provide assistance.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and in many species we don’t even know how their populations are doing. ”
Ronaldo rejects charges of violence, while his lawyers intend to invite German magazines
Cristiano Ronaldo identified charges against him for violence as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote" using his name.
His lawyers are going to invite the German intelligence magazine Der Spiegel, who published these accusations.
The Portuguese attacker Juventus was accused of rapeing American women, Kathryn Mayorg, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel's Friday report, the dancer was to pay a woman $375 000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years), a few hours after the announcement of the charges, in an instagram of life directed to his 142 million followers, identified these reports as "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's news is fake news," said a five-time gold ball winner.
"They want to be promoted using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's fine," the dancer added a smile on his lips.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to invite Der Spiegel to the store for the proposals, which they called "inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy" – as Reuters says.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the footballer would seek compensation for “moral damage in the amount of a violation that is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
We said the meeting was to take place in June 2009 in the hotel room Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting Ronaldo and Mayorg at the nightclub, they also went to the ballroom, where he was reportedly raped by the woman anal — as is the result of documents filed in the district court of Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after a riverbed and told her that "99 percent is a good man", which was visited by this "one percent".
According to the evidence, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was too popular.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photographs of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later she agreed to a further agreement because she “was afraid of being taken” and “publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old says he wants to nullify the deal now, because he can still not forget the river.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this year he moved to Juventus after paying 100 million euros for him.
Brexit: Great Britain "would regret all the time" departure of car manufacturers
The Great Britain "would regret it all the time" if after leaving the European Union, the world leader in car production lost his status, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that "he was concerned" when a representative of Toyota UK told the BBC in an interview that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement, production in the factory in Burnaston is not far from Derby will be temporarily suspended.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays on the border in the absence of an agreement on Brexit could lead to a reduction in jobs.
The factory in Burnston, in which the Auris and Avensis models are produced, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, with 90% of them exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union at the end of March without agreement, then production will be stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other British car manufacturers fear leaving the EU without agreement on how to operate cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW intends to close its mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern, as car manufacturers claim, are the risks associated with the supply chain when the European Union leaves the United Kingdom without agreement.
Toyoti's production line operates on the basis of "just-in-time", in which it covers 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU in the case of cars produced on the order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, difficulties can arise on the border, which, according to industry representatives, may lead to delays and partial disadvantages.
As the representative of the company said, Toyota would not be able to last more than one day without delivery to his factory in Derbyshire, so production would be stopped.
Clark said the Chequers Theresy May plan on future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want to achieve the best of possible agreements that will allow us not only to enjoy the current success, but will also allow us to make the right use of this situation," said BBC Radio 4.
"Not only Toyota's statements, but also other producers, show that we have to be able to continue what was a very efficient supply chain set."
Toyota’s representation was unable to determine how long production would be suspended, but warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the company, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been a member of the U.S. corporate board for 24 years, said that the members of the relationship are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are to be abolished, they will never be restored.
The government spokesman said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan of our future relations with the European Union".
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again as the White House provides
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "lated for next week" because of the ongoing fight against candidates to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, as he gave the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who examines the possibility of Russian interference in the election, the links between close collaborators Trump and Russia, and the potential difficulty in the exercise of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump will release the Deputy Attorney General, threatening the same independence of Mueller, has been a hot topic in Washington for a month.
At the beginning of this month's New York Times, Rosenstein spoke on the subject of a hearing to record talks with Trump, as well as on the possibility of removing the president from his position on the basis of Amendment 25.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
On Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports as if he were going to give himself up.
The date of the meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would not let Rosenstein down. There was a meeting to be held to avoid colliding with the Senate judicial commission, during which the testimony was presented by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump managed a weekly FBI investigation into charges directed against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
The Trump Pressman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News station.
When asked for a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, and it may be moved for another week, taking into account all the events associated with the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'm sure I'll inform you about this press."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders did not hold the White House press conference since 10 September.
The program leader, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences were not caused by a lack of "scientific" television journalists, and she added, "I will not hide that they are "scientific".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The President-in-Office carries out more "questions and answers" sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding without giving any evidence: "We have met with numbers".
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if journalists are able to ask the President of the United States direct questions, that is a much better solution than talking to me.
We are trying to do this regularly, and in the last few weeks we have done it very often. Press conferences will be held at such sessions, during which you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with guest dignitaries.
The solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why it is, acting too freely and sometimes strangely in front of the assembled journalists.
Minister of Health writes to workers from countries of the European Union employed in NHS Scotland in the face of concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health issued a letter to workers from the European Union who were employed in a shocking health service in order to express their appreciation for the country and to ask them not to leave for Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter for less than six months until Britain left the European Union.
The shock government has already committed itself to covering the cost of dealing with applications for "setled status" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “The negotiations on Britain’s departure from the European Union have been continued in recent years, and decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The British Government has also intensified preparation for the possible scenario of exit without agreement.
I know this is a very troubled time for you all.
That is why I wanted to repeat once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleges from all over the EU and beyond offer valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing surgery as a result of a head injury
A team of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, went through the operation as a result of a head injury in a Saturday match with Vanderbilt Commodores, who ended up defeating a team of Tennessee with a result of 31-27, told Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of the Tennessee State team, told reporters that the racer had suffered a stroke shortly before the end of the first half.
"He came to the side line, after which he moved to the ground," Reed said.
Medical coaches and staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line, then placed it on the nose and carried out further tests.
The representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie was operating at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the nature/size of the strike yet", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the strike occurred.
Abercrombie (second year's student released from the school's annual representation to improve her skills) plays his first season in the Tennessee State team after transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the match ended, he had five scars, which gave him 18 scars throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
In line with the new plans of tourists buying from abroad, there will be higher treasury charges for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom. The measures will thus be used to help the homeless.
This move is intended to undermine the success of Jeremy Corbyn's actions to attract a young electorate.
The tax ceiling will cover persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury Ministry thus provides that it will earn up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May informs today that the foreign buyers in the United Kingdom will be charged a higher treasure fee and thus the additional funds will be allocated to the homeless.
This move is taken as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract a young electorate to the promises of cheaper apartments and increase the burden of more profitable people.
Higher tax fees will be payable to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom. Additional measures will help the government in the fight against unemployment.
An additional fee — which is included in addition to the current treasure fee, including two years ago higher rates than the other houses and rent-purchase flats — may be up to three percent.
The treasure of the state expects that this move will make it possible to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price increases and hindering the purchase of the first house or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy real estate, and most of the time spends abroad, many wealthy regions — and in particular the capital — have become “the city of the spirits. ”
The new rules are only a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call for a reduction in treasury fees to help young people buy the first house.
He accused major developers of maintaining high real estate prices by taking over the area, but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to remove the free housing restrictions in order to eliminate the "dwelling scandal" in the United Kingdom.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including the regulation of rents and the end of the "without cause".
He also wants to grant local governments greater powers in the construction of new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I said that as a prime minister, I am committed to rebuilding the British dream that every next generation's life would be better than the previous one.
It also means repairing our popular housing market.
The Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right that persons who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can easily buy real estate here as hard as British residents work.
For too many people, dreaming about their own home has become very remote, and therefore humiliation related to the need to sleep on the street remains real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to become a Scottish electorate"
Sunderland's coach, Jack Ross, says his "most ambition" is to become a Scottish selector at some point.
This forty-two-year-old Skot is working on the North-East Club healing, which is currently taking third place in League One with a three-point loss in relation to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this year after the last season he introduced St Mirren Club back to Scottish Premiership.
"I wanted to represent my country as a champion,
but I was only able to get to B," Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
“As a child I often watched with my father the Scottish game in Hampden and it always drew me.
However, such a possibility will come only if I bring success as a club coach."
Among the predecessors of Rossa at coach Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
They were coach Alloa Athletic says he doesn't feel upset, taking the role of so-called personalities in such a big club, rejecting earlier proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“I would like to see if I could introduce this club back to Prime Minister League.
In view of its structure and the satisfaction it has, there is no doubt that its place is there," he adds.
"It won't be easy to do this, but I'm sure I've been successful here, only if I'm successful."
Ross's coach career has lasted only three years. Previously he was a coach assistant in Dumbarton and for 15 months he belonged to the Hearts coach team.
Next, he helped Alloa to progress again after the third league was demolished, and in the next season he led the St. Mirren team from the fall to the championship.
Jack Ross says he now feels much more comfortable than when he played Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a real point of reference" – so mentions coach Allo's position.
"I really believed that driving a team is much better for me than playing.
It's gonna be weird, 'cause as a champion, I've done my best, and I've achieved a few huge successes.
But playing is a heavy piece of bread.
You have to get through different situations every week.
They still meet me when it comes to stress and pressure related to coach work, but I feel good about this role.
I've always wanted to train others and now I'm doing it, and I can say that I feel the most at this point in my adult life."
The entire interview at Sportsound can be heard on Sunday, September 30 in Scotland radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST time
Studies show that the best beer season is 17.30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer wave of floods caused a violent flow of customers to British pubs, but she had a checkup on the restaurant networks.
The studies showed that in July sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s consultant, who developed the data, says: “Earths fell and longer than expected in England in World Championships caused the results of July to be similar to those of June when the turnover in pubs increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that the wages of the restaurant fell even more.
As recorded in June, 1.8 percent of the sales drop in restaurants in July has increased even more.
The drinkers of the pubs and bars had the best of their ability — their sales increased by more than a drop in the restaurants.
Food-serving pubs also suffered during floods, although not as much as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just being pushed.
The sale of drinks in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent this month, and food fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from RSM, who is involved in the entertainment and tourism industry, says: “These results are reflected in the trend that we have observed since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the size of 'outside home' consumption remain the weather and major sporting or social events.
The fact that restaurant networks are experiencing difficult moments, not surprising, although the sales drop of 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year will have particularly significant consequences, given the constant pressure to reduce costs.
The long and burning summer has come at least at a good time for the owners of the dining rooms and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring the necessary inspiration."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting slowing in the development of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which is involved in monitoring sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds.
One for five children has a secret account in social media that hides from parents
Studies have shown that one for five children — some of whom are only 11 years of age — has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents and teachers
The survey carried out by 20 thousand students showed an increase in the number of fake Insta pages
These news raised concerns that the content of sexual content was published on them.
Twenty percent of students have found that they have a "main" account showing their parents
One for five children — some of whom are only 11 years of age — has an account on social networks that do not reveal to adults.
The survey conducted by 20 thousand students in the school has shown a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" — the name refers to the Instagram service in which you can share photos.
These news expressed fears that these accounts were used to publish content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students have admitted that they have a "main account", which shows their parents, and also has a private account.
One of the mothers, who, in an accident, went on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, met a teenager who urged others to "kiss her".
The study carried out in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters Association" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles. Half of them are admitted to holding private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers create their own places on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Elid Doyle will become the "voice of athletes" in Scottish Athletics Management
During the annual general meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board, Eliid Doyle was elected to the board as a non-executive director.
Eilid Doyle is the most famous Scottish lightyear. President Ian Beattie has defined this move as a perfect opportunity for those who manage sports to benefit from her rich international experience that she has gained in the last decade.
"Eilid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world light-years community and we are confident that its introduction to the government will bring great benefits to the Scottish light-years," Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I am very happy that I will be able to deliver the votes of athletes to the Council, and I hope that I will be able to really help managing sports in Scotland.”
The American, who among his four gold medals in the Olympics, has won 200 and 400 metres in the Olympics in 1996 and is now regularly in the role of an expert at the BBC, cannot be the result of a passing blood attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that the time would show me if I were to regain my ability and to what extent.
It was a routine job, but I was completely healthy, I learned to walk again and I went back to practice!
Thank you for all the words of support!"
Advertising of lactators that compares mothers to cows stimulates extreme online emotions
The company producing lactators caused a noise on the Internet, publishing a advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to breast-feeding.
In order to announce the introduction into the market of "the first silent lactator in the world to wear clothes", his producer, Elvie, published a teledic broadcast that highlights the freedom he provides to his mother.
She presents four real mothers dancing in a blue band in which to hear the words: "Yes, I do, but I don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice, it's not just my tits."
Refren goes like this: “Smoke them, pump them, feed them, pump them, pump them, pump them, and I will give you my lord. ”
The advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, sparked major online controversy.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them claim that it is inappropriate to joke about the "horror", which takes place in the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to the body, because their children have been taken away after a few days from birth," wrote one of the users.
Elvie lactator can be taken with a bistonous to feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is of course traumatic for both the mother and the child.
Of course, let's use cows to advertise lactators for mothers who can keep their children."
Someone else added: “This advertisement is completely overwhelmed by reality.”
Another weapon of the clip — one of the women found the song to be “beautiful. ”
"I think it's a great idea.
If I still chew my chest, I'd buy myself that way.
I just felt like a cow when I took off my food.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I don't try it on the second day.
It's a brilliant invention" — someone wrote.
Another commented: “It’s fun advertising directed to mothers who take away food (often at work or toilet) and feel like ‘ cow’.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, it turns out that women danced with lactators discreetly attached to their chest.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many feeding women felt like cows.
However, Elvie's lactator is completely quiet, has no cables or pipes and can be worn undetected under the bustonous to feeding, which gives women the freedom to move, to keep children on their hands, and even to leave the house during the withdrawal of the meal.
Ana Balarin, a partner and creative director at Mother’s company, said: “Lactator Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a brave and provocative premiere.
By putting together nourishing women and milk cows, we wanted to show all the challenges associated with the withdrawal of food, presenting at the same time in a fun and consistent way the incredible feeling of freedom that he provides.
This is not the first time that lactator Elvie hit the head of the newspaper.
During the London Fashion Week, during a show by Marty Jakubowski, a mother of two children with this product was introduced.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been secretly transferred to the rental camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by immigrants is growing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border each month does not change, and this is partly due to the fact that the harsh rhetoric and the rules introduced by President Trump's administration have made it difficult to place children in sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually also undocumented immigrants who are afraid of exposure to deportation if they report after a child.
Such a risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that from potential sponsors and other adults living in the common economy, fingerprints would be collected, which would then be transmitted to immigration offices.
Last week, an older officer at the Immigration and Customs Strengthening Agency, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who had reported themselves as sponsors for children left without care.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees were not previously recorded.
“There are not 80 per cent of the people who are sponsors or reside with them in one domestic economy, residing in the country illegally, and most of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That's why we keep chasing them," said Albence.
Secretaries say that in efforts to speed up the situation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require a part of them to appear in court within a month of detention — not after 60 days, as was the case with previous standards.
Much will be done through the videoconferencing, not personally, to ask the immigration judge to legalise their status.
Those who do not qualify for exemption will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier they can become uneasy or depressed, which can in turn lead to outbreaks of aggression or attempted escape.
The defenders found that these problems are even more serious in larger centres, such as Tornillo, where it is easier to see signs that something bad is happening with the child.
They also added that the transfer of children to the rental camp without providing them with the right time to prepare emotionally or with friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria calls for the immediate withdrawal of the US, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
During his speech before the UN General Assembly, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moual, also called on refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in that country has lasted for eight years.
The Moual, which also plays the role of the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces reside illegally in the Syrian land, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "we will deal with them accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he announced to the Assembly.
The Moual states that "war on terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360 thousand people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to “run its holy battle until the territory of Syria is cleansed” both from terrorist groups and from “all foreigners who are illegally staying on it”.
Currently, there are about 2,000 American soldiers in Syria, who are primarily trained by the Kurdish and Syrian forces against President Bashar al-Asad and their advice.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the war-damaged country.
As for refugees, Moual has found that conditions are good enough to allow them to return, and has accused "some countries in the West" of "increasing unreasonable fear", which discourages them from returning.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations for help in these returns," he said.
"They're policing things that should have a clean human dimension."
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad meets the opposition to the political agreement to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid.
The United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a buffer zone in the last major rebel base in Idlib has created the possibility of continuing political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped to prevent a major attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province in which three million people live.
However, the Moual stressed that the agreement had "a clear time frame", and expressed hope that military action would be measured in the jihadists, including fighters associated with the Al-Qaida Front of the Levant People's Defence, who would be "demnified".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, is hoping to call for the first meeting of a new commission made by members of the governing party and the opposition in order to draw up a framework for the military constitution of Syria and prepare for the elections.
The Moual set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Commission, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "to verify the records of the current constitution" and warned against ingerction.
Why Trump wins the election again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected second in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are sure, his presidency would end earlier by removing it from office and scandal.
It would certainly be "the most dramatic finish of the Presidency so far".
As of now, there's no sign of sight fatigue.
Since 2014, the results of CNN’s monitoring of the channel have doubled and reached 1.05 million, and the MSNBC canal has almost doubled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen Fox News, on average, 2.4 million views are attracting the highest viewing hours, which is an increase of 1.7 million over four years ago, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" program presented in the MSNBC channel has achieved the highest results among cable TVs, attracting up to 3.5 million views of evening information programs.
“People are going to go to the fire — that’s something we don’t understand” said Neal Bear, ABC’s leading producer of the “Designed Survivor” series, a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy creator and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys", has another theory.
It mentions how she was driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The director said he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he mocks me," he replied.
Chaos has fun value.
Of course, reports from Washington could, like anything else shown on television, judge the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the admissibility of the association of immigrant families or the state of the world economy.
Disfellowshipping is a luxury that only the most privileged visions can afford.
In addition, this is not just about being a well-informed citizen when you look at the panel of experts discussing using Bob Woodward from secret informants when writing the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's shirt with a string of $15,000 (the "loaded suit", as stated in The Washington Post) or about the implications of the shocking descriptions of President Trump's anatomy published by Storm Daniels.
I'll never look at Super Mario like I used to.
“What he does is partly a reminder of the reality of the show in that every evening he delivers new content” said Brent Montgomery, Director General Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pawn Stars" about changing the content and daily return of the show Trump (as an attack on NFL league champions or the praise of Kim Dzong Una).
You can't afford to miss a date because you're gonna have an addiction.
When I met Mike Flesm this week, the weather on the northern coast of the island of Kaua, where he has his home, was beautiful, but he sat in the middle looking at the MSNBC and recording the CNN.
It could not be avoided, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing in front of the Senate Court Commission and the future of the Supreme Court was being weighed.
"I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right."

Cash flow from outside to election campaign to Congress
It is not surprising that after the reorganization of the electoral districts, which will now become two current congressmen in the race for one position, the cash flow will continue until the 17th election in Pennsylvania.
This newly established Submigrant District of Pittsburgh is represented by a representative of the Democrats, Conor Lamb, who won his place in another county during the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district in Pennsylvania, which is largely covered with the new 17th district.
The maps of the districts were corrected after the January judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled that the old districts were not fair, which gave the Republics an advantage and was incompatible with the constitution.
The new round 17 race began with the fight to finance the campaign between the party's main funding bodies — the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
The name Lamba was popular in Pennsylvania after winning hair in a wide-ranging election to the 18th round of elections that took place in March.
In this position he has been a Republican for over a decade, and Donald Trump has won 20 points in this circle.
Political experts gave the Democrats a minor advantage.
The United States considered punishing Salwador for supporting China, but they withdrew from this idea.
The diplomats noticed that the Dominicans and Panama have already recognized Beijing, despite the slight opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump had a warm meeting with President Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and until he was expelled by the partners of the Trump Organization management team, he had a hotel in Panama.
Officials of the State Department decided to revoke the heads of American diplomatic missions from Salwador, Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the recent decisions to end Taiwan's recognition", said Heather Nauert in his statement this month.
However, the sanctions were to be imposed only on Salwador, who, according to estimates in 2017, received $140 million from the United States, inter alia, aid to combat drugs and support for development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which were intended to limit financial aid and grant visas to certain persons, would be very relevant to this Central American country, which is struggling with a large unemployment rate and a high murder rate.
In the light of the progress made in the international meetings of North and Central American officials, the high-level conference was to address security and economic well-being in order to address requests from a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from being submitted to the United States.
In mid-September, the highest level administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus doing all the consideration of sanctions against Salwador.
Diplomatics say that the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, will be attended by Vice-President Mike Pence, who will be a witness signal to the meeting of the representatives of the administration.
The three American envoys returned quietly to Salwador, Panama and Dominicans. They did not accompany any new raw communications or punishment from Washington.
John Bolton, a member of the White House, refused to comment on the details of the debate that was presented by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal interpretations under the terms of anonymity.
Their relations were confirmed by an external analysis of the administrative environment, which also expressed itself anonymously.
Learn History
Another element may be the Special Prosecutor's report, Robert Mueller, on the possible impediment to the justice action by President Trump, which is currently available to the public.
According to reports, Robert Mueller's investigation also examined whether Donald Trump's campaign had something to do with Russia's attack on the American elections.
If the composition of Congress is changed, President Trump will be held responsible when preparing for re-election before the electorate, and may even be tried before the jury.
There are many unknowns here, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump — or people on equal positions in Europe — is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which decides how long it can last.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to take action against Hitler if only the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
This failed, and we lost the chance to avoid the years of the harvest that followed.
History circles turn around such points of return, speeding up or slowing down the inevitable course of democracy.
There are now several such points in front of the Americans.
What would we do if Donald Trump was fired by the Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who depends on the future of Robert Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since we discovered in our newspaper that last year he proposed a secret recording of the president and speculated that he wasn't going to the office.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by The Times is inaccurate.
“How do we react if a new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh proves incomplete or unjust or if he is appointed a judge of the Supreme Court, despite the credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony on him?
And above all, in the mid - presidential term, will we choose those who will take over Donald Trump for responsibility at the Congress?
If we don't pass those tests, there will be difficult times for democracy.
However, I believe that we can succeed — because of the lesson I was taught in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over my residence as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to burn the sabbatical light on that table marked by swastika.
Having such an inheritance, how can I not look optimisticly into the future?"

The leader of the Rangers Club, Graham Dorrans, with the optimism of waiting for the match with the Rapid Vienna team
The Rangers take on Thursday with the awareness that the victory with the Austrians, which was won after the impressive return from Villareal achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying for the G League of Europe Group.
Until 2:2 of Villareal's collision the knee prevented Graham Dorrans from playing this season's assistant, but he believes that this result works on the Rangers as a trampoline for greater success.
"It did us good because Villarreal is in good shape," said 31st.
“We went to this game with faith that we would achieve something — and we won the point.
Maybe at the end we could still push them, but in general the remix is probably a fair result.
Spain was probably better in the first half, but in the second we were better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, this is another important evening for Europe.
We hope we can get three points, but this game will be hard, because our opponent has got a good result in his last match.
Last year, it was extremely difficult because of everything that I had to do with my contusion and changes in the club itself, but now we all feel good in our places.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we'll be able to move on, leave the last season behind and bring success."
The fear of pension savings makes women sleep out of sleep
Although participants in the poll knew exactly how much they wanted to take care of them, there was little talk about it with the family.
In a study conducted by the Nationalwide company, about half of the participants found that she spoke to her partner about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't have a conversation on this," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Insurance Company.
From what?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to take care of you if you do not express your will beforehand.
Talk to your counselor and family where and how you want to take care of yourself, because this choice will be an important factor in costing.
Ask the financial advisor for help: He can help find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds can come from a traditional police to such care, a hybrid police that allows you to pay cash to cover such expenses, or from your own property, as much as you own.
Prepare legal documents: You will avoid these battles.
The designation of a trusted health care provider who will monitor it and ensure that the persons concerned act in accordance with your will if the communication becomes impossible.
Consider, too, the employment of a full-time employee who will be involved in finance.
Choose a trusted person because she will make financial decisions for you and ensure that all accounts are paid if you are not able to do so on your own.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your parents in the old age suddenly need medical help and they are just going to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about medicine and allergies?
Write down all the information to have them ready.
"It's not just about finance, it's about who the doctors are," Martin asks.
"What are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It's worth having such a plan under your hand."
Man repeatedly shot from the windshield in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times from the wind when he came home from the party.
Four hundred kilometers were located in the vicinity of Oxford Grove of the town of Ilfracombe in Devon County, when it was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
The police identified the shooting that took place around 02:30 BST time as "accidental action".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
The damage is not a threat to the life of a man, and the police are asking to report the witnesses to the incident.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake on earth and tsunamis that visited the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
No information from the Dongal cabupatene, which is located north of the Pala, was obtained due to the lost communication of the rescuers.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala after the disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Pala and the Kabupatje Dongala on the island of Celebes:
Pala is the capital of Central Celebes, a province located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island. According to estimates in 2017, it had 379 800 people.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the 40th anniversary of its establishment lasted in the city.
This is caused by kabupatene (administrative unit at a level below the province) extending along the north-west coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 it was inhabited by 299,200 people.
The main branches of the Central Celebration economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed in particular in the coastal area of the Danube Cape.
Another source of the province's income is a hilly nickel, but it is located mainly in Morowal, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to information from the Indonesian Agency for the Elimination of Disaster Impacts, over the past 100 years earthquakes and tsunamis have visited Paul and Dongal several times.
In 1938, the tsunamis that struck Dongala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of the tsunamis in western Dhakali.
Indonesia is on the active Pacific ring of fire, which causes earthquakes to occur on a regular basis.
The greatest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The great earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra caused the tsunamis that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, from which more than half in Aceh.

Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidates for the vice-president, Sir Palin, was arrested under charges of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, from the town of Wasilla in Alaska, 29 years of age, he was arrested with domestic violence attacks, difficulty in filing the report and putting up his resistance to arrest.
According to the police report, when the suspect's friends tried to call the police to report a crime, she took her phone.
The KTUU station reports that Palin is in a trace arrest of Mat-Su and has a designated bail amounting to $500.
According to her information last Saturday, she stood before a court where in her defense language she said she was “innocent for sure”.

He was also accused of exceeding Class B, which threatens the punishment of the day of imprisonment and the fine of $2000.
It's not the first time that Palin's been charged with crime.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is now before the Alaskan court of veterinary claims.

Federal prosecutors demand death sentences for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
New York federal prosecutors demand death sentences for Sayfull Saip, suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York, resulting in the death of eight people.
To carry out an attack, which took place in October on a cycling trail along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, a 30-year-old Saipov reportedly used the rented Home Depot truck, which was driven by pedestrians and bikers on his way.
According to the New York South District, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "whole" killed eight victims and "whole" caused serious bodily injuries.
According to the court document, both of these charges are threatening the death penalty.
Several weeks after the federal jury's attack, Saipov presented a 22-point indictment, including eight counts of murder in illegal activities — which is usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime — and a call for violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutors, the organization of the attack required "solid planning and thinking". The way Saipov conducted it was defined as "constant, cruel and immoral".
"Sayfully Habibullaevic Saipov has caused harm, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clevesa, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariela Erlija, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca" – a statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine citizens who stayed in New York touristically.
The last time the death penalty in the South District of New York was introduced ten years ago.
The accused Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but finally in September 2009 he heard the verdict.
The death penalty as a result of the federal case was last performed in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenbergach. Marriage was lost two years ago when they were considered guilty of conspiracy and espousal for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were lost in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov's court documents, which come from Uzbekistan, he did not show any convictions during the month following the attack.
The police say he told the investigator he's feeling good about what he's done.
According to Saipov's indictment, the authorities admitted that he was inspired by ISIS films that he had seen on the phone before the attack.
According to the police, the ISIS flag was also required to be suspended in his hospital.
The action file covering 22 counts as innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders of Saipov's office, said they were "for obvious reasons disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and to reject life without the possibility of a prior release from guilt will only prolong the suffering caused by those events to all interested parties," he said.
Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Toryman says that NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
During today's protest, which took place during the tourist conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people".
They were the leader of the Independence Party of the United Kingdom (UKIP) said politicians must "feel hot" against Eurosceptics when one of the MPs suggested that they should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
A Conservative MP, Peter Bone, told demonstrators in Birmingham that if Farage was the secretary of Brexit, "the United Kingdom would already be outside the Union".
However, the attachment of the remaining tourists in the Community to the personal protest against Brexit, which took place in the city, further underlined the burden of the commitment of its deep-divided series standing before Theresa May.
Your Prime Minister is trying hard to implement his plan of compromise with the Chequers among the attacks by the Brexit supporters, its opponents, and the European Union itself.
Her allies say that despite the opposition, she will seek to conclude an agreement with Brussels and with the Eurosceptics and the Labourers to make a choice between the proposal and the 'chaose'.
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave Assembly in Solihull that he wanted to "send out a plan from the Chequers".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be a full-fledged member, to whom the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels should be delegated.
"If he were to do so, now we would be outside the Union," he said.
A member of Wellingborough added, "I support Brexit, but we have to throw out a plan from the Chequers."
Presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in world wars for the sake of being subject to anyone now.
We want to establish our own rights in our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that the citizens had changed their opinion since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and want to remain in the Union is absolutely false".
At the demonstration there was also Brexit Andrea Jenkins from the tourist party, who told reporters: “I’m just saying: Your prime minister, please listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not happy with the overall support, the opposition will not vote for it, our party or our activists, who drive the streets and who chose us, and they don't support it.
Please drop the plan from the Chequers and start listening."
In the statement addressed to Prime Minister May, she added: "The preambles will keep their positions when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage stated that politicians taking part in the demonstration must "be hot" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a matter of trust between us — people — and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell 'we won't let you do it."
Returning to the scattered crowd, he added: “I want you to make the politicians on the edge of the Brexit betrayal feel hot.
"We mobilize the army of the people of this country, who gave us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not sleep until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
At that time, Brexit’s opponents massed through the city to the center where a two-hour demonstration took place.
The crowd of activists was marching on the "Tourism Against Brexit" banners after the group was set up this weekend.
The labor worker, Baron Andrew Adonis, praised the conservatives for their problems with the security of the party app at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who claim that they can organise computer systems and all technology to support the Canada Plus Plan, a liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There's nothing like good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to "seriously consider" candidacy for the president
American Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after November's elections "he will seriously consider running for the president".
As The Boston Globe reports, a representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about her future when meeting with the voters who took place on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticises President Donald Trump, will apply for a reelection in November. Her opponent will be Republican representative, Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 elections.
It is now said that in the 2020 elections Warren can defeat Trump.
This Saturday's Holyoke event was her 36th meeting with the voters in the Town Hall formula, since Donald Trump took over the office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for the president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington to repair our famous government — and she also means a woman on the same mountain. ”
Arresting a deadly gunman who killed a LSU team player, Wade Sims
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana informed us on Saturday of the arrest of a suspect on the Friday shooting, in which a basketball player from the LSU, Wade Sims, died.
The Baton Rouge police department informed of the arrest of 20-year-old Ditéon Simpson during a conference that took place at 11:00 Eastern Time.
A shot with a request for help in identifying the male was published on Friday.
A 20-year-old Wade Sims died as a result of a shooting near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot with a firearm in his head, resulting in his death," said the police chief, Murphy J. Paul, in service 247sports.
Wade stood in the defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having a crime scene, had a gun with him and shot Wayde.
After he was arrested, he was transferred to a police station in East Baton Rouge County.
At 1.98 m Junior Wayde Sims was raised in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches, at which time in the last season he started 10 times, during which he spent on the park on average 17.4 minutes, earned 5.6 points and counted 2.9 collections for the match.
Grand Prix Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after the team's command enabled him to win with Sebastian Vettel
Since the time that Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the Mercedes team's command will have a major impact on the outcome of the race.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and almost beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two circles and forcing Vettel to attack his colleague from the team.
The Vettel went to the service point as the first one and allowed Hamilton to ride in the pellet's lap, which should be determined by the race's leaks.
The leader of Mercedes went to the box next round and appeared behind Vettel, but after the action round, as a result of which the driver of Ferrari reluctantly left the inner part of the road, risking the push to defend after a double-moved race to defend the position on the third round, Hamilton moved on.
Max Verstappen started at the end of the stake and was found in the seventh place at the end of his 21st birthday at the end of the first round.
Then, through much of the race, he led because he did not change the tire in order to make a quick finish and take over Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he reached the point of service on the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could no longer speed up. The fourth place took Raikkonen.
“It was a hard day because all weekend Valteri did a great job and turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me go.
The whole team gave everything to take the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body speech.
During a meeting that took place Saturday, President Donald Trump met Senator Diana Feinstein, who maintained that she did not disclose the contents of the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which she accused Judge Bretta Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the statements made by Christina Ford before the Justice Senate Commission, but said that what happened in the Senate showed that people were “slow, angry and lying”.
"What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have witnessed for a few days when we see the anger when we see people who are angry, angry, angry, angry and lying," he said.
"We see what has been published and revealed, and then they tell us 'oh, I didn't do it'.
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document? — Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Wait, wait.
Did we reveal... No, did we not reveal"--he added, disposing of the senator.
Diana Feinstein received a letter from Christine Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and her contents ran out in early September.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's insinuation, I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein confessed to the commission, as The Hill reports.
"She asked me for discretion, and I did not disclose these contents, as she requested."
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented on it during the Saturday meeting: “I’m telling you, it was really bad speech.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst speech I've ever seen in my life."
By continuing to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, whose three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats use insinuations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take over all measures.
You see, wickedness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take over authority and control," said the president, according to Mediate's report.

Air traffic controller dies, helping hundreds of people on the plane to escape from the earthquake
The air traffic controller from Indonesia was summoned by a hero after he died, helping to safely launch the plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died, and many were considered missing after the great earthquake on Friday, which struck the Indonesian island of Celebes, causing tsunamis.
In the region there are still sensitive strong secondary shocks. Many people have been imprisoned in the city of Paul.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his position in the scattered flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pal.
He was there to ensure that the Batik Air (lot 6321), which was just on the starting line, was safely launched.
Then he jumped out of the tower when it seemed to him that they were falling apart.
He died in the hospital.
According to the Australian ABC News station, Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the controller's decision probably saved hundreds of people's lives.
We organized a helicopter from Balikpapan to Borneo to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthony left this morning before the smoldering man reached Paul.
"This message broke our heart," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are concerned that the number of deaths may reach thousands. The National Agency for the Elimination of Disasters informs that access to the city of Dongal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We believe that the harvest of death continues to increase, because many bodies are still under the guise and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The six - foot - long [6 m] waves destroyed Paul, where the mass burial of the victims will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said at Sky News station: “The Ambulans will constantly import bodies.
There's no drinking water.
Small shops are loaded."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is speeding to rescue, but we don’t know what we’re going to stand for.
It's already a tragedy, and it might be even worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, approached the army: “All of you, please, work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
In this year Indonesia has already been hit by a earthquake that killed over 550 people on the island of Lombok.
A plane crash in Micronesia — Air Niugini lines indicate that one person is lost after the plane crashed on the lagoon
Airline maintenance flights, which broke into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific, reported that one person was missing. Earlier they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the flying plane.
Air Niugini reported that according to the data on Saturday afternoon, one man who traveled by feral aircraft could not be counted.
They made sure that they and the local authorities, hospitals, and investigators were trying to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details concerning passengers such as their age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water while trying to land on Chuuk Island, the rescue of other passengers and crew members helped local ships.
The officials informed on Friday that seven people had been transferred to the hospital.
The airlines said there were six passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is not clear what was the cause of the disaster, but we are also unaware of its exact course.
Airline and U.S. Navy warships claim that the plane landed on the lagoon not far from the starting pass.
According to some witnesses, he got out of the dog.
American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was coming very low.
“It helped us a lot, ” he said.
Jaynes said he and other people managed to dive through the running dog water to get out of an emergency towing plane.
According to him, the crew members panicked and yelled, and he himself suffered a terrible blow.
The U.S. Navy warship reported that the rescue operation also helped mariners who were working nearby to modernise the coast. They managed to transport people to the shore by means of a steaming boat before the plane sank to the depths of about 30 metres.
According to the Aviation Safety Network database in the last two decades, 111 people have been killed in the airlines of Papua New Guinea, but Air Niugini is not among them.
The analyst reconstructed events from the night the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor concluded the submission of evidence in the retrial of a male accused of burning alive women in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, for many hours testified as an expert in the analysis of information.
He described to the judges how with cell phone records he replayed the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he was getting data on the location of various cell phones that showed that the Feral Night Tellis was from Chambers.
When the data confirmed that at the time when Quinton was supposed to stay with his friends, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interrogate Sanford.
On Saturday Sanford said he wasn't in town that day.
To the prosecutors' question about whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he replied that "he lied because my truck was then in Nashville".
Another insanity is Tellis that he's known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records have shown that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis he removed her contact data from the phone, as well as text messages and connections.
"He took her out of his life," said Hale.
The final defense is due to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that the case was likely to be handed over to the jury on the same day.

Another black?
Nania from New York invites a couple for release after "racist" SMS
Nania from New York calls for her to be released from work on a racist basis after receiving a misdirected text, in which her mother complains that she is a "black person".
The couple objected to being racists, comparing them to "santage".
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly depressed when it turned out that a new nurse, Giselle Maurice, who had just arrived at the first day of work in 2016, was a black girl.
“NOEEE, KOLEY CLARNA MANBA” – wrote in her text to her husband.
But instead of sending him to him, through mistake she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post report, when Plasco-Flaxman was aware of the completed gaffe, Giselle Maurice was released by Giselle Maurice, claiming that the hearty nanny, who is African-American, was wrong to carry out her duties, and she was also expecting Nani from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice received a day's pay and was then sent to the Uber house.
Now it is claimed that the compensation be paid for the exemption of $350 per day for six months, which was originally employed with the dwelling, although it did not sign the contract.
"I want to show them that such things are not done," said Post on Friday and added "I know it's discrimination".
The couple's defending the charges of racism, claiming that the conclusion of the cooperation with Maurice was justified because, as they imagined it, they feared that they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," she told the Postman, Joel Plasco.
"Would you trust your children to whom you have made a mistake, even if it happened by mistake?
Your new-born child?
Come on."
Compared to "santage", Plasco said that his wife was born only two months earlier and was in "very difficult situation".
"Do you intend to blow up something like that?
It's not too nice," he added the investment banker.
Although the case has not yet been brought to trial, the public opinion quickly issued a few rulings on social media, criticizing it for its behavior and thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of the book about Paddington were afraid that readers would not feel bound to the talking mission.
The author’s daughter Michael Bonda, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s warm reception, says: “It’s hard to get to the place of the person who read it for the first time, even before the book was released.
It's really fun now that we know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
She claims that her father, who, before the little plush mouse inspired him to write a book for children, worked as a cameraman at the BBC, was sure that his work would be rejected. She also adds that after his death last year in the 60th year of publishing the book, he seems to be "sweet-gross".
Paddington, described as “a very important member of our family”, says her father was in secret proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, he didn't whisper," he adds.
“But because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost like having a child who did something — you feel proud of him, even though it is not your duty.
I think Paddington's success has been seen in less than that way.
Although he invented it himself and created it, he always gave his own service to Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter was landed, she was transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were empty-handedly trying to save her life.
"Now he called regularly and said it's really bad that he probably won't get out of it," says Tanya Ednan-Laperous.
"Then he called to say that Natasha will die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart working slowly stopped working and were released from the body.
She died a while ago, and that was the end of it all.
I could just sit there and wait with a sense that it's all evolving.
I couldn't go out or cry or cry because I was among other people.
I really had to stick to it."
At the end of Tanya Ednan-Laperous, who was already crying for her daughter, she boarded with other passengers, unaware of the trouble she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
I had my head down, and my tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt all-encompassing compassion for Nada.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's mails in mourning are supposed to help prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide try to get away from taking life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting on the Welsh post office with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed, and at the age of 18, he took his life.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," he says.
The 45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, tells us that her son was a good cook with a remarkable smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
They always said they could explain every room to him."
However, before he died, he quit his job because he was “in a really black place”.
In 2014, Brother Tyler was 11 years old, and he just found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I always fear the effect of domination."
Sharon Davis created a card, “to tell people that there are people to whom you can turn and who you can talk, even if you only know them.
Don't sit still, talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, soon after her mother died, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years.
“He didn’t say that he felt ashamed, sad, or anything,” he says.
“A few days before the birth of God, we noticed a change in his behavior.
When the children opened presents, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It broke the hole in the family.
It's distracting us.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh depends on Italy because the FBI is initiating an investigation.
"I thought that if we were really able to get what we asked for — a temporary and limited investigation — we might be able to achieve some uniformity," Jeff Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the Commission would "depart" into the opposing camps that lead to the impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
All their desire comes from time to time.
The elections to Congress are already in a few weeks — November 6 — if, as expected, the Republic loses its chances of choosing a particular person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has already raised a hearing to call the senators and urge them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of the president.
What happens when the FBI prepares a report?
A vote will take place in a meeting of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is unlikely that Brett Kavanaugh will have at least 50 senators, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the impasse and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under the Kima governments, the number of refugees from North Korea is low
According to South Korean legislator Kim Dzong Un, since seven years ago, the number of people fleeing North Korea has fallen.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of the United Nations, Park Byeong-seug said that 1127 flights were recorded last year, and in 2011 – 2706.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more detailed border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates taken by the people.
Pyongyang did not issue a public statement on this matter.
The vast majority of North Korea refugees are finally proposed South Korea citizenship.
According to the Seoul authorities, since the end of the Korean war in 1953, the border has been illegally crossing over 30,000 Koreans from the North.
Most of China flees, which have the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than a strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between both Koreas.
The Chinese consider refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often send them back to the country.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is theoretically still in the war, has clearly improved in recent months.
During this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pjongang, where they held talks on the negotiations on denuclearisation, which had previously been in the dead point.
This happened after a historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Dzong Un, which took place in June in Singapore.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of missing progress in this matter.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty as to our national security and in these circumstances there is no way that we can defend ourselves on the one hand as the first one," Ri said in a speech that he spoke before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavanaugh "histories" and claims that he is not allowed to work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh "history" and said that he was not naturally able to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelos expressed these words during the interview she made on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think that if a woman acted this way, she would be considered a 'histories'," Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony that Kavanaugh presented on Thursday before the Senate Commission on Justice.
Kavanaugh was emotionally opposed to the alleged sexual harassment of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At times during his opening speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — he almost screamed and lost his speech when discussing family and personal matters.
He also made a clear victory for the Democrats from the Commission, setting out the charges of "gross and coordinated reputation" organised by the liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelos found that according to her testimony, Kavanaugha showed that he was not allowed to work in the Supreme Court because it revealed his prejudice about the Democrats.
"I think that he has made his own distinction by issuing these statements, as well as by the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
She was asked whether she would try to withdraw Kavanaugh from the office if he received his appointment and if the Democrats had won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi was nervous.
"I say so: if he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also be in that court where he is currently working," she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Pelos added that as a Democrat, Kavanaugha fears possible decisions on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial because it is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmatory hearing of Kavanaugh, he wondered whether he would violate some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time to bring a historical court forward who will expect us to say 'but it is wonderful'," Pelosi added.
And women have to rule it.
It's the right diet, months, and years of the fury, and she can't throw it away without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
"It's pretty common, isn't it?"
She added: “A woman who was a manager in a company helped me greatly. She said that she also wept when she was angry, but she made up a way that when she was upset and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, ‘You sure you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm mad.
He's still doing his own thing.
I thought it was great."
Forests are allowed to enter the anger after part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories of one of the first crews in a man - dominated office is how one time I started crying out of unresolved anger.
"Never let them see how you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, who was then a member of Congress in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat named Monkey Business and got out of the race, frustrated at Patricia's border, she realized that she could actually consider the idea of a self-sponsored candidate for the president.
“It wasn’t a thought - out decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“The election was already the seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was the next.
Someone has identified this situation as 'King Snow and Seven Magnificents''.
As the campaign has lasted for a long time, Schroeder has been addicted to fund-raising and promised he won't join the race if he doesn't collect $2 million.
It was a battle that was doomed to defeat.
She then discovered that some of her favourites, who gave $1,000 to the man, had only 250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts? ” she wondered.
During the talk that she announced that she would not lead a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotion — gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over a system that made it so difficult to collect money and return to the electorate, not to the delegates, and anger at sexism — that the voice put her in the throat.
"You might think I've gone through a nervous breakdown," says the press.
"You might think that Kleenex is sponsoring me.
I remember thinking about what they're going to write on my tape.
"She cried?"
What benefits can the economic war between the United States and China bring to Beijing?
The economic wars between the United States and China have been aggravating and, although the battle is still ongoing, in the longer term the conflict between these countries can be beneficial to Beijing, experts say.
The first warning was launched this year by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, imposing duties on China's key export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week following the introduction of new tariff rates for goods worth $200 billion (150 billion) which resulted in the taxation of half of all goods flowing to the United States of China.
Every time, Beijing reciprocated in nature, lastly raising taxes on American goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
The Chinese are determined to respond to every US hit, and it does not seem that the other economy in the world will soon end.
The push for Washington to withdraw is to accept the demands, but the public will be too clumsy for President Chin, Xi Jinping.
According to experts, however, if Beijing was well playing its cards, the pressure resulting from the US trade war could in the long term strengthen China, reducing the dependence between both economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the spread of economic chaos in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers so far," said Abigail Grace, a researcher in Asia's thought tank Center for New American Security.
According to the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, "prepared" to return refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for assistance in rebuilding a country destroyed as a result of more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Moual, said that conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation in our area is now more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
In an effort to restore normality, the government is constantly rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have already been met so that refugees who have to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic movements measured in their daily lives and maintenance measures can return to it voluntarily.
According to the UN estimates, over 5.5 million citizens have left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mouale said that the Syrian regime would gladly accept help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept the aid granted under the conditions or offered by the countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe threatens the success of Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018, winning the US team from 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
In the European land, the United States has already lost its sixth row and since 1993 has not won Ryder Cup in Europe.
Europe recovered the trophy when, under the leadership of Danish captain Thomas Bjorna, it won 14.5 points that were needed to conquer the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who was not well for most of the tournaments, hit a ball from the base directly to the water at the 16th floor of PAR3, giving the same match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined through all the rounds and became one of the four players who since 1979, when this tournament first took place in the current format, managed to achieve the result 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by 5&4 by the lowest ranking player from Europe, Thorbjorna Olesena from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the highest position in the world ranking, lost two dolls in front of the last doll with English Ian Poulter, for which it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
Hispan Sergio Garcia, who has already taken part in eight of these tournaments and has won 25.5 points of career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop today.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I'm so happy to have you back in the oven.
It is the success of the whole team and I am pleased that I was able to help," said the excited Garcia after the victory of the team from Europe.
He's handing a finger to his cousin, John Rahmo, who won a single American golf legend on Sunday, Tiger Woods, result of 2&1.
"I feel amazing pride in the winner of Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all the matches in France and now has results 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
It's unmatched statistics, like one of the biggest players of all time, who got 14 key titles and gave up only to Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had a whole weekend problem with finding the current, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
Following the disappointing appearance of his American captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I am proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point in the morning, we pressed some Europeans.
We're out of here.
Head drops in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love those 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of surprises for the opponents.
They played a lot better than us."
