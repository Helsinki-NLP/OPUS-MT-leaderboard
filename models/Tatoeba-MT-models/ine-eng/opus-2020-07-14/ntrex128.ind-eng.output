Welsh is worried when they look like a muppet doll.
There are concerns among some AMs about a suggestion that their name should be changed to MWPs.
This led to plans to change the name of the nobleman to be the Parliament of Welsh.
The AMs throughout the political spectrum are worried if it can lead to temptation.
A working-party AM said that his group was interested, "The call is filled with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means dirty.
A member of the council (AM) said that his group as one union, felt "unsatisfying" and had suggested some alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group's "open thinking" about the name change, but it's estimated that this is a sample of the short-term MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the w letter in Welsh is rendered as the w letter in the English of Yorkshire.
The current Supreme Commission set up laws to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any explanation of the name for the AMs is of course a problem for the members themselves."
Wales’s 2017 ruling power gave Wales the power to change her name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the known proposal for broad support to refer to the nobleman as Parliament Welsh.
On the issue of the AMs, the Commission prefers WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/ Members of the Welsh Parliament), but MWP options get very much support in public consultation.
The AMs seem to provide alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can eliminate the leader, Elin Jones, who was expected to hand over those legislative changes in a few weeks' time.
These reforms laws will include changes -- other changes in the way the factory works, including the rules of disculsification for the AMs and committee system plans.
The AMs will get a final voice on the question of how they should be called when they discuss laws.
The Macedonians went to give a speech on the referendum on the change of country name
The speakers will decide whether their country name will be changed to "North Macedonian Republic."
The sound was heard in an effort to settle the dispute for a decade with Greece’s neighbor, who also had a province called Macedonia.
Athena has long insisted that the name of the neighboring country on its north side shows an acknowledgement of its territory and has repeatedly rejected the EU and NATO membership bid.
President of Macedonia Gjorge Ibanov, an opponent of the call for a name change, has said that he will ignore the call.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is the price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's Lanceng-lonceng didn't care when the churches in Harlem had trouble.
"Historically, the parents I spoke to say there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adam
"Today, none."
He said that disappearing all the bars could be over.
"People are socializing in another way" now, he says.
"There's no more room for public guests around where people visit it regularly."
Likewise with the church, he was worried that the proceeds of asset sales would not last long as the leaders expected, "and quickly or slowly they will return from the beginning."
Churchmen, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominium filled by people who would not help to keep the holy places around him.
"The majority of people who will buy condominium in these buildings are white people," he said, "and for that reason it will speed up the day where these churches close together because it is not possible that those who moved to those condominium will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by a white community before Harlem became the metropolitan town of the Black People’s Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The Metodys region of the original white skin moved in the 1930s.
The black - and - black areas of the area around us have taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black community under the leadership of Prince John Howard, who led a trade fair on 125th Street, the main way to shop in Harlem, who refused to work or promote black people.
The fire in 1939 destroyed the building, but when Prince Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, they built a tower tower tower.
Prince David Johnson, Prince Johnson's son, and his replacement at St. Martin with pride calling that tower belleng as "Lonceng poor people"
One expert who threw the tower bells in July gave him another name: "A cultural treasure" and "a historic instrument that is unparalleled."
One expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also noted that this was the first tower launch in the world played by black leather music, Dionysio A. Lind, who turned down the larger tower launch in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What happened in Santo Martin in the last few months was a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought by public church leaders, and others brought by the Episcopal general.
Westerners -- the general manager's body, which is made up of public leaders -- wrote to the generals in July with concern that the generals "will strive to pay the costs" to the westerns, even though the westerns are not involved in the architectural and contractional divisions sent by the generals.
Some of the parishioners prevented the transparency of the generals.
Hiu injured a teenager 13 years of age in a lobster accident in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he drowned to catch a lobster in California in the opening of the lobster season, the wake of an officer.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. near the Beacon Beach at Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had slept with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy asking for help and then grouped up to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a moment of joy after he caught the lobster, but then he “attempted” that the boy shouted, ‘ I'm being bitten!
I'm bitten!'
The whole bones were broken," Hammel said he realized when he had the child.
And I cried unto all the people to come out of the water, saying, There is a pool in the water. And Hammel added.
The boy was sent to the San Diego Hospital, where he was treated under critical circumstances.
The shark species responsible for the attack are unknown.
Captain Lary Giles Coast Guard said in a media conference that a shark had seen in the area a week earlier, but it was classified as a non-hazardous shark.
Giles adds that the victim has severe injuries to his body.
Officials have closed access to the beach from the Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinita for 48 hours for research and security.
Giles realized that there were more than 135 shark species in this region, but most of them were considered harmless.
Sainsbury's article splits the British beauty market.
Sainsbury takes over Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with beautiful tortoise kiosks, which are run by specialist assistants.
As part of the substantial drive towards the British beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while selling fashion products and household appliances down, the larger beauty kiosks will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed as more next year's store if it proves to be successful.
Investments in beauty are hunting grounds for supermarkets to take advantage of the drugs that were used as a place to watch TV, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sciencebury said that it would represent a great supply of beauty up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The brand range that currently exists starts from L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with the dive area as found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also resuspended its store cabinets so that most of its products would be comfortable with things that were becoming more interesting by young explorers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfume cleaners will test the concessions in the two store Sinesbury, which was first opened in Croydon.
Online shopping and changing the daily needs of food in small numbers in local malls means that the supermarket has to do something more to trick people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive head of Sciencebury, has said that the motions will become more and more like Mall when the supermarket chain tries to fight back farmers like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and more services in vain.
Sciencebury has put Argo's motions on hundreds of stores and has also introduced some Habitat's motions since they bought them two years ago, which he said has supported the sale of food daily and made a more favourable statement.
The previous supermarket contribution to the department of beauty and pharmaceuticals ended with failure.
Sciencebury tested the bootwork with Boots in early 2000, but the same work ended after there was a dispute about how to share the benefits of the chemical market in that supermarket.
A new strategy arose after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds' pharmaceutical packaging, worth £125 million, three years ago.
It was reported that Lloyds would play a role in that article, adding expensive leather care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sciencebury, said, "We've changed our looks and appearances on beautiful kiosks to repair the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who are willing to offer advice.
Our brand range is designed to suit all needs, a tight environment and a comfortable location.
Peter Jones 'grey' after Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a £11 million deal.
Dragons Dan star, Peter Jones went 'with the heat' after the TV player Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a life-style business deal worth £11 million to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to control the market for the household appliances and their accessories, True.
This couple's business is compared to Goop's Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
This Morninger, 37 years old, uses his Instagram account to announce that he's out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons star" Den, Petes Jones angry with his interest in the last moments, from the life-style business of them that's making them happy - to focus on his larger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source says that Jones was so "gracious" when the golden girl admitted during the meeting on Tuesday at his business center office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new deal -- worth up to £1.5 million -- means he no longer has enough time to serve on the market of household appliances and their accessories, True.
Their business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop market and is expected to increase Willoughby's wealth to a total of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce that he left True, Jones flew away from Britain to one of his holiday homes,
One source says, "Truly so far is the most important Holly priority.
It was going to be the long-term future, which would keep it going for several decades to come.
Its decision to give up made everyone involved a real stumbling block.
No one can believe what happened on that Tuesday, really safe with the launch time.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready to sell."
Experts believe that this Morning event, which is one of the most expensive English stars, can damage the company up to millions of dollars because of a large investment in product form, ranging from bed linen and linen to household clothing and furniture, and there is a potential for further launch.
And this could mean that it ended up a long relationship that's been going on.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby set up True with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined in the leadership in March.
This couple are on vacation together, and Jones has 40 percent of the stock on Baldwin TV production.
Willoughby will be a trademark for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of the I'm A Celebrity I'm program.
A number close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on this business relationship."
Seriously, 'and then we fell in love'.
He was joking about the criticism he would get from the news media because he made comments that some people considered to be "unpresidential" and had been very positive to the leaders of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with the voice of his "readers".
"I don't give up anything."
He knew that Kim was interested in meeting twice after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which was praised by Trump as a step forward for the conquest of North Korea.
But the negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore, the highest North Korean diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, spoke to the leaders of the world. On Saturday, the United Nations General Assembly, that North Korea did not see any "response" from the United States to the early arms movement of North Korea.
On the contrary, he noted that the United States continued its sanctions to maintain pressure.
The trumpet looks more optimistic in the series.
"We're doing the best we can with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this wonderful relationship,"
He said that his success in repairing the relationship with Kim had led to positive results in stopping the rocket, helping to free the hostages, and restoring the remaining U.S. soldiers to their homes.
And he's defending his insensible approach to talking about Kim's relationship.
"It's easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this busy arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing to the crowd that was right in front of him.
Indonesia’s Tsunami and Camp destroyed an island, killing hundreds of people
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, the non-governmental organization was told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population lost their homes, there was no statement of national disasters, as a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've explained that they're not asking for international help, so it's quite challenging," Mrs. Sumbung said.
While Save The Children are planning a team to go to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a jury of national disaster management, said that the Indonesian office was investigating the situation in Palu to see if the foreign bank was allowed to contribute to the aid.
In view of the ongoing development of Indonesia, this country is still far from ready to face the wrath of nature.
While the tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not a general view on the other shoreline.
There was no tsunami alert in Palu, even though dangerous alerts had been reported, it was likely that there was a contribution to the death penalty.
At the best of times, travel between many islands of Indonesia is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
It will take at least three days to reach the new location.
President Joko Widodo has created a damaged Indonesian infrastructure for the purpose of the election campaign, and he has spent money on the construction of the highways and railways.
However, a lack of funds had disturbed Father Joko’s rulership while he faced a choice back in the year that followed.
Father Joko also faced the pressure of ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have embraced the form of more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of people fled their homes when the Muslim and Christian groups fought in the streets, using bows, bows, and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Player Liverpool Daniel Sturridge inserts balance goals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea at the Premier League with one score in a minute at 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received bait from Jherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from outside Chelsea's cage when the team left 1-0.
He put the ball on his left before kicking him to a fart.
It's a high-voltage ball on top of the cage when the ball moves to the right corner of the chain.
The ball finally fell through the risk of jumping and falling into a chain.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think too much of it, and just make a tension."
Chelsea's lead with score 1-0 in the first half after the original Belgian player Eden Hazard printed a blank on the 25th minute.
The Blue attack gave a turn back to Mateo Kovacic at the game, before turning around near the middle line and running fast to the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gave the bait and ran in the middle line.
He then made a perfect effort to lead Hazard into the wilderness.
Hazard made it through the back of the enemy and threw the ball to the edge of the gap with his left leg, across Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool fights Naples in the League Champion's firing squad at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Tuesday, 3rd Sunday.

The victim of the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The victims of the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia have increased by 832 people, including the country’s disaster victims on Sunday morning.
Many are reported to be trapped in the destruction of buildings that were destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 Richter’s scale, which swept through Friday and triggered a 20 - foot [20 - foot] flood, says Sutopo Purwo, a banker jury in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with fallen buildings.
The police arrested a man, 32 years old, for a murder trial after a woman was beaten to death.
A murder investigation has been conducted after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44 - year - old woman was found at Grayson Mews, John’s street, at 7.55 p.m., with some musculoskeletal injuries, while a 32 - year - old man was arrested for murder.
The police have asked people around to see or hear something to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "Research is still at an early stage, but I'm asking everyone around John's road at Birkenhead who sees or hears something suspicious to contact us.
I'm also flattering everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have recorded something on the base camera to contact us because they might have important information for our investigation.
The jury has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is local Birkenhead and he was found in a building.
Tonight, friends who feel confident that they know the woman have come to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still under way, as police have said, they are in the process of telling relatives about the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just returned to his apartment, but was told by the police that no one was allowed to come in or out of the building.
The man couldn't say anything when he knew what was going on.
Now the citizens are being told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer heard telling someone that all areas are now being treated as the scene of things.
A woman appeared in a place where she was crying.
He's always saying, "This is a terrible thing."
At two o'clock in the morning, two vans of police were on the line and the others were outside.
A number of officers stood in the line to watch the apartment block.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCc, phone 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on number 0800 555 111 by typing log 247 on September 30th.
The image of Parlemen Cromwell became the last memorial to be celebrated by the 'historical rewriting'
Its destruction will be a poetic justice for the destruction of al-Taliban against many of the cultural and religious artifacts of England made by fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society describes Mr. Crick's advice as "foolish" and "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, leader of the Cromwell Society, said: "This cannot be avoided in the current debate on the destruction of images, that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the court of Westminster will become a target.
The Anglo - American World War I was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong offspring of Cromwell would have been sacrificed to his ancestors in the first century C.E.
The amazing representation of the Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a 19th - century opinion and a piece of historiography that many people still believe is worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many people, perhaps by the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliamentary advocate against external pressure, of course the kingdom.
Whether it's a completely accurate representation, it's still a subject of a controversial historical debate.
Which is certainly that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the next nation's development, and Cromwell is a socoke that can be identified as an individual representing one side of that difference.
His achievement as a Protector is also worthy of honor and remembrance."
The Killer’s Babies Love Chinese Farmers Until They Leave
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeast Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his brand name "Yuan", was found dead with a broken artery, blood clot near a pig camp in the Guizhou region of Liupanshui, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to launch a vaccine to pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in the Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He was reportedly gone with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Thursday to sell 15 pig eggs in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the pig’s tent door near him had opened.
He said that in the pig’s tent there was a large pig with blood in his mouth.
Scientific research confirms that the fertilized pig with a weight of 550 pounds has persecuted the farmer until his death, according to the report.
"My cousin's blood and destruction," said the cousin known as "you," as quoted by the Evening News Guiyang.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his babies.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent him from attacking others, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities are reporting that they are reaping compensation for their death.
Although it's rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years ago, a pig weighed 650 pounds torturing a Welsh farmer into his tractor until the fearsome wife drove the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pig was usually not aggressive but the smell of blood could act as a "pemique".
"They're just playing.
They're gagging, very curious to know... they won't come out to hurt you.
You just need to give her enough respect," she said.
The rest of Rosa's storms brought their rains to the west of the United States.
As you can imagine, the Rosa storm weakened when it moved over the colder seas on the north coast of Mexico.
In any case, Rosa will cause flooding throughout the region of northern Mexico and western United States for a few days.
Rosa has a wind speed of 85 mph, Category 1 storm, starting at 5 a.m. on Sundays in the Eastern Region, and located 385 miles west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa was likely moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Palatine began to form above the Pacific Ocean and moved east towards the US West. When Rosa approached the end of California on Monday as a tropical storm and began to push tropical falls north to the west of the United States.
Rosa will bring rain to 10 inches [10 inches] in most of the Mexican territory on Monday.
Then, a tropical flood that interacts with the nearby summits will create abundant rains in the West of the Sea for a number of days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause a dangerous flood, a puddle stream, and the possibility of long-lasting land in the desert.
A low tropical flood will cause the rainfall to reach between 2 and 3 inches per hour at some points, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
A total of 2 to 4 inches of rain are estimated to descend in some parts of the West of the Day, especially in the vast part of Arizona.
Floods are likely to occur with conditions that quickly deteriorate because of the widespread tropical rains.
It is not highly recommended to go through the desert by walking on foot because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause the floods to become violent, and storms can cause local and dusty storms.
Nearly two miles [2 km] from the coast of South California would lead to heavy local rains.
The total rainfall of more than half of the inches is quite possible, which can cause small points to flow and the highway to become a loci.
It will be the first rain in that region in their rainy season.
Some widespread tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and Monday morning, before the rains become wider on Monday and Tuesday.
The great rain will spread to four o’clock in the afternoon and will continue until the Lord’s Evening Meal.
In October there will be some great temperature changes throughout the United States when the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropical region remains quite warm.
Sometimes these things cause dramatic changes in the temperature in the short term.
There is an accurate example of a dramatic difference in temperature throughout the U.S. area during the middle of Sunday.
There are some 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For a few days in advance, the remaining heat will be formed and spread again.
Most of the Central and Eastern U.S. regions are expected to start warm in October with speed spreading over 80s from the South Sea to the parts of the East Sea.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast showed a high chance for temperatures above the average for the Eastern United States by mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed Brett Kavanaugh’s verdict.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by the High Court of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of having committed sexual violence that was expected to happen in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political turmoil continued, with publishers deciding on a regular program to report unexpected events in the last minute of Friday: An agreement that Senator Arizona Jeff Flake had planned for the FBI to conduct one week's investigation of the charge.
Ford said to the Senate Justice Committee that the woman was 100 percent confident if Kavanaugh had to rub his body in a drunken state and tried to take off his clothes at the high school's high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his overwhelming testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
There may have been more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, watching it.
The company counts the percentage of memory on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Accounting for other networks that provide this is not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting the number of people who saw him in the office.
To put this in perspective, it's the number of spectators almost equal to the football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, who thinks its organizers are very supportive of the Kavanaugh show, is the top of all networks with an average of 5.69 million Memorialers throughout the day, says Nielsen.
ABC has a second position with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million mirrors and CNN with 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
The interest remains high after the trial.
Flake was the key to that Friday drama.
After the Office of the Moderate Republican Party issued a statement that it would choose to support Kavanaugh, he was arrested by CNN and CBS camera on Friday mornings being shouted by a relief visitor when he tried to climb to the justice committee.
He's standing down for a few minutes when he's tracked down, sent directly to the CNN.
"I stand right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
And it was said unto him, Thou hast power over many women, and they have no power.
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that there were many other things he had to say in the committee.
TV cables and radios were all connected directly a few hours later, when the Judicial Committee would choose to fight Kavanaugh's appeal to the whole Senate for a hearing.
But Flake said he would only do that with understanding that the FBI would investigate charges against the calon for a week ahead, as the minority Democrats have requested.
Flake has been assured by some of the talks with his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
Pasca spoke to Coons and some senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has power, because it's clear that the Republic's party won't have a voice to approve Kavanaugh without any investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case.
The British Prime Minister accused the criticism of 'political play' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the political critic of playing with Britain's future and undermined national importance, on his plan to get out of the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
English Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews that appeared on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched an attack on what he referred to as a Cheques plan for Brexit, said that the proposal on England and the EU that should collect each other's tariffs is "a lot of nonsense."
Wade Sims Shooter: Police arrested the suspect Dyteon Simpson in the LSU player's death.
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Ditéon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and imprisoned for two-level murder, says the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Simpson and the police told Sims to lose his eyelids during the fight.
The police found those eyes on the scene and said they found Simpson DNA on that thing, the WAFB CBS affiliate reported.
After interviewing Simpson, the police said he claimed he had committed fatal shooting against Wade.
The contract has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
Coroner's office, the Eastern Baton Rouge Paroki Paroki, reports a survey on Friday, says the cause of death is a head shot to the neck.
The department thanked the jury for the mission of the Louisiana National Police, the state police lab, the Southern University police, and the people around it in the research aid that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement officer for "fighting and seeking justice."
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
With an altitude of 6,6 feet in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Average points were 5.6 and up to 2.6 in the game last summer.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said his team felt "damaged" and "surprising" with Wade's death.
"This is what you've been worried about all along," Wade said.
The mountain is blowing the ashes in Mexico City.
Apu who came out of the mountain of Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre alerts Mexicans on Saturday to get away from the fiery mountains after activity has increased and registered there are 183 gas and gray emissions in the generation of more than 24 hours.
It's been watching for a couple of moments of excitement and excitement.
The images in the media social media show a tiny gray layer that lies on the front of the car in the vicinity of Mexico City.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase of 45 miles (72 km) south of the city’s capital since the earthquake of 7.1 B.C.E., in September 2017.
This mountain is known as Don Goyo, which has been active since 1994.
The Catalan separatist patrol police ran through the freedom election celebration.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the protest protests with the anti-hospital police, and when thousands of people joined in demonstrations to mark the first Catalan polling campaign on self-defence.
A group of pro-separatists who were detained by the anti-torture police threw them with their eggs and threw them into the pit, creating dark clouds of dust on the roads that would normally be filled by tourists.
The fight also took place after that day with policemen who used their stick to control the fight.
For a few hours, groups of pro-freedom groups shouted "Don't forget, there's no forgiveness" in front of the fans of the labor union shouting, "Hidup Spanish."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries obtained in the prosthetics, a local press report.
A year after the October 1st referendum considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatist, the country’s main focus was on maintaining its stability.
The electorate prefers to be a beggar, even though the number of chosen ones is low with those who oppose their own differences and most of them ridicule their choice.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the sound of the public in the entire region in a violent storm.
Pro-freedom groups camped in the evening on Friday to prevent demonstrations in the national police support ranks.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take different routes.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for the prospect of independence from Catalonia.
"Last year we spent one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry in vain because they could choose, but now we're trapped," he said.
Despite the success of a little vital victory in the December regional election, Catalan pro-freedom parties have fought to defend the moment this year, although many of their well-known leaders, who are in exile or in detention, are awaiting trial, on their role in organizing referendums and further declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests with his cell phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been tackled by politicians on both sides.
"Now it's getting stronger," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been in prison for the past year, announced that he would step up to the European Parliament's election next year.
"Being a candidate for Europe's election is the best way to compromise the values of democracy and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house was taken with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car broke down a house in Londonderry.
That incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage happened at the gate and the building itself.
A loophole may also have been shot in the direction of the car at some points.
The goal that Menga printed has won for Livingstone over Rangers with score 1-0
First goal of Dolly's for Livingston to make sure the win
Livingston's victory caused the Rangers to fire Steven Gerrard from his position as manager of the Ibrox Club, both of which were defeated in 18 matches.
The Dolly Menga attack has proved to be a difference when Gary Holt's side movement is similar to the hibernian in the second row.
Gerrard's side remains unbeatable in the Premiership this summer and faces the Hearts leaders who are eight points ahead of them, the next Sunday.
Previously, Rangers were seeing you at Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingstone, in the meantime, lengthens their unbeatable record in the division to six matches, while Holt's coach's head still has been down since Kenny Miller was replaced last month.
Livingstone has lost the opportunity to fight a vicious party team.
The Holt team should have been tall before they printed goals, with their precision that gave Rangers a variety of difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through, but his effort to get past the gangway, and then Alan Lithgow could only expand his efforts after the entry and face of Craig Halkett from across the gang.
The houser is happy to let Rangers play the top of the game in the beginning, knowing that they can make it difficult for the team to come up with the event of the dead ball.
And that's how to produce a very important goal.
The Rangers of free movement and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got rounds and prints empty from the middle of the field.
At that stage, Rangers had dominated power but realized that the housekeeper's defense could not be beaten and Liam Kelly's skull was completely unaffected,
It goes on to the second chapter, although Alfredo Morelos managed to fish for Kelly's rescue.
Scott Pittman was beaten by the guards' legs Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow far away because of the other livers' tactics.
The attack continues to come to Livingston's cage and is constantly being avoided, while two defendants' claims - after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton's replacement player, and one for handball - are rejected.
'Fenmenal' by Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alaska Lamont by Tony Macaroni Arena
The performance and the outstanding results for Livingstone.
For a man, they're amazing, they're still beyond hope on this ongoing journey.
The game and their staff have hardly changed since they got back to the board, but the big credit has to be given to Holt by how he strengthens the team since his arrival.
He's got so many jackets.
Captain Halkett was very big, leading a well-organised defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the watch during the game.
Nevertheless, Rangers lack inspiration.
Whatever they did at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was not good - only once could they break the house side formations and it became a reminder to Rangers, who realized their existence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan's got a different audience in Cologne.
There were smiles and blue skyscrapers on Saturday (September 29th) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany - aimed at improving the relationship between NATO forces.
They are arguing about problems, including human rights, the freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open up a new big house.
This city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police mentioned a security reason to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mob, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan defenders -- many of them the Kurds -- also voiced, threatened both, Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to that country.
The protests describe the existence of an indictee who was welcomed as a hero by some Turkish citizens and considered to be a dictator by others.
Get on the Deptford road: The riders of the bike are killed in the car crash
A bicycle driver died in a car crash in London.
The strike took place near Beswost Street and Evelyn Street, many streets in Deptford, on the southeast side of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The strike took place months after another bike driver died in a runaway camp at Childers Street, about 1 mile away from the strike that Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were trying to identify the man and preach to his family.
The roads were closed and the bus routes were handled as well as the drivers were driven to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six men in charge of the injury.
Six spies suffered injuries in a man’s prison in strict custody, the office said.
There was a breakdown in the HMP Long Lartin prison at Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sunday and still on.
Specialist "Tordo" has been assigned to handle the complaint, which involves eight prisoners and occurs on one side of the building.
The officers were treated at the scene because of minor injuries on the face.
One jury spoke: "The specially trained leaf officer has been assigned to handle the incident that is happening in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not engage in violence in this prison, and it is clear that the responsibility will be given to the police and that it may have to spend a longer period of time behind bars."
The HMP Long Lartin prison supports more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous naparadists.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was treated in a hospital after being attacked by a naparadist.
And in October last year, an anti-circumvention officer was called to prison to deal with a serious complaint where a police officer was attacked with a ball.
The Rose storm threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with a flood.
The tropical depression that hit Arizona rarely happens, but that's what's likely to happen in the early weeks because the trail of the Red Badai that's left through the western desert of power, triggers a slow-winding risk.
The National Weather Service has issued a warning on Monday and Saturday for the West Arizona region to South Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to direct directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, to attack the late evenings along with the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix mentioned on Twitter that there are only "ten tropical storms capable of causing tropical storms or depression in 200 miles of the Phoenix region since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The most recent plague was able to predict between 2 and 4 inches [2 and 4 inches] of rain, with the number of isolations reaching 6 inches [6 inches] in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Another western desert area, including the central Rockies and Great Basin, is likely to be 1 to 2 inches high, with the probability of the number of isolations reaching 4 inches.
For those in the valleyless region, the Rosa rain may be a blessing because of the drought.
Although the flood is a serious problem, most of this rainstorm is likely to deplete because at this point the western region of power is being weakened.
According to the U.S. U.S. U.S. surveyor, only about 40 percent of Arizona area experienced a little extreme decline, the second highest category," weather.com reports.
First, the route through the Rosa Bay led to the east of California on the coast of Mexico City
Rosa, still in the stormy power on Sunday morning with the speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north with the speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm hit the Pacific Ocean, and for that reason, its power was weakened.
That's why it's supposed to land in Mexico with a tropical storm power on Monday afternoon or night.
Rain may be high in some parts of Mexico, causing high wind risks
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is estimated to cross the California Black Zone to the western area of Sonora's power, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reports.
Then Rosa will cross the northern part of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona on Sousa today as a tropical depression, which will cross through Arizona and south to Sousa in the middle of the night.
"The main risk that could be caused by the Rosa storm or the rest of it is a very high rainfall in Baja California, the western part of the Sonora Sea, and the U.S. western part of the A.S. desert." The National Storm Station (NHC) said.
The rain will be expected to threaten the flood and the buildings that flow into the desert, and it will occur long - term land in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton attack: four suspects' arrest of attempted murder
Three young men and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a broken wound in Somerset.
The young men were found injured in the Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton area, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was in stable condition.
A 17 - year - old man, two 18 - year - olds, and one 20 - year - old were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon, and Somerset, says the police.
The officer's been smiling at anyone who might have a video of that incident on his cell phone to come reporting.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'accepts hatred and anger' of the Democratic Party
"One voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the harsh and humiliating Democratic Party's politics," said Trump in a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "accepted hatred and anger" of the Democratic Party during the process of kidnapping
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, forced and emotionally denied a charge by Christine Blasey Ford that he had committed sexual violence to her several decades ago when they were still a teenager.
Ford also testified in the verdict on his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the wisdom and quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"One voice of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to strengthen someone who has the most perfect law thought in our time, a jury with a record of true public servants," he said to the West Virginia supporters' group.
The president implicitly refers to Kavanaugh's recruitment when discussing the importance of the Republic's participation in the middle of the election.
"Five weeks before it happens one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really getting drunk," he said.
"That's why I went there to the west, fighting for a great calon.
The trumpet argues that the Democrats are on the mission to "fight and block."
The first-sounding procedure at Senate level in Kavanaugh's appeal is expected to be carried out at the latest on Friday, a senior GOP assistant said to the CNN.
Hundreds of people died of Indonesia’s tsunami earthquake, with increased casualties
Less than 384 people were killed, many were devastated when the giant storm hit the beach, when the earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi Indonesia, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu on Friday when the six - foot - high [18 m] flood destroyed the beach in the evening, causing much death and destruction of everything it passed.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the threat of tsunamis increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and not running so soon as they became victims," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB, said at a time of emergency in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, he pulled the car, wood, house, dive all that was in the ocean," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before crossing the beach line.
Some climb trees to save themselves from tsunamis and survive, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24 service centers in Palu.
The air photo produced by the BNPB showed many ruined buildings and shops, dams and farms, and a pool surrounded by water.
The rioting earthquake swept the city along the coast on Saturday.
Earthquakes are felt in the region of 2.4 million souls.
In a statement, the Research and Technology Recovery (BPPT) stated that the energy released at the Friday mass campaign was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb force that was dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city’s geographical location, which is at the end of a long strip, can be said to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage that occurred as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of a ruined building, he said, adding that there were 540 injured victims and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage could be greater along the 300 km (190 miles) line along the north of Palu, a region called the Dongala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Communication "very smooth with no information from the Dongala, Nugroho says.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers are headed to a region affected by disasters.
"This is a tragedy, but it can get worse," he said.
The relevant authority on Saturday received many criticisms because it did not inform that there was a tsunami that struck Palu, although the authorities said that the waves had fallen when the warning was issued.
An amateur recording shared in media society shows a man on the floor on a building that sounds alarming with panic there will be a nearby tsunami, towards the people on the street below.
In a minute’s count, the water flows along the beach, smashes buildings and cars.
Reuters can't immediately prove the validity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami are the biggest causes of electricity shortages in the area of Palu, which have led to the difficult task of coordinating the rescue effort.
The military has already begun to send cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and its cities, according to the authorities, but refugees are still in dire need of food and other necessities of the tree.
The airport has been reopened only to provide relief services and will continue to be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's Tsunami victim increased by 800.
That's very exciting.
When World Vision officials from Dongala managed to safely reach the city of Palu, where the officers were sheltered in the ceiling of the roof of their office, on their journey they had crossed a wide range of porous areas, said Father Dosebah.
"They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very terrible.
Even when the relief team began to move slowly to start disaster relief activities, some of those groups prevented some of the riots against foreign volunteers who had skills, who were going to go to Palu.
According to Indonesia’s rules, immigration, relief of goods and energy from outside the country can only begin to be reported if disaster areas have been officially identified as a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a jury speaking for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, OK, this is a national disaster," we get international help, but there's no status yet."
On the second of the night the earthquake will strike, and the companions and families of the deceased will hope that the loved ones will be part of a miracle that will improve the course of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was expelled from the kitchen.
On Sunday, the rescuer released a woman who had been confined to the shed for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandoro, a coach of the Indonesian national team, has been a coach for two missing parachute athletes, who are able to follow the Asian Games that ended early this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped in Hotel Roa-Roa, with Father Mandagi, were his disciples.
"As a senior in the nursing sector, I have my personal emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how after news of the destroyed Roa-Roa Hotel leaving around the former community, with despair he sent a message to whatsApp to the Palu competitors, who went on and on the beach.
Even so, all of his messages, only got one sign of the blue cents, not the blue cents.
"I think it means that a message is not sent," he said.
The robbery takes $26,750 during ATM deployment at Newport in Levee

Kanye West: The Rapper changed its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Advertised the name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It was formerly formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has already had a Ye name for some time and used it as its eighth album title, which was written in June.
The change was made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to replay his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande's singer to show on the show, which was cancelled because of "emotional reason," said the show's creator.
As a brief for his professional name right now, before West said it meant religious to him.
"I believe 'yes' is a common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West early this year, discussing the album title with the publishers of Radio Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that name is us.
That name was taken from Kanye, which means only one, to be Ye--as a mirror of our good, our misery, our confusion, everything.
That album is more of a true self-defense."
He was one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known in various ways as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a major link and letter.
Mexican President AMLO swore not to use military in the face of civil society
The elected President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he will never use military force against civil society until the 50th anniversary of the blood penalty against the student.
Lopez Obador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "they would never use military force to push Mexicans."
The army fired fire on demonstration activities that took place peacefully at the Plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at that time, when the movement of the left wing students planted its root throughout the Latin American region.
Lopez Obador has guaranteed support for young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those who are studying and opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunity for education motivated young people to form criminal gangs.
A.S. is supposed to represent A.I.'s recruitment.
Because China is more active in the field of engineering intelligence, the US should be describing the amount of money that will be used for research in that area, says the investor and practice A2 Kai-Fu Lee, who has been working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comment came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. was completely undermining the formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: the goal of becoming number one in the 2030 AI innovation.
"Introducing AI research resources is a good start, remembering all other countries tend to stay away from the US, and we're looking for the next drugs in the AI field," Lee said.
Determining the resources can make it possible that the next major AI achievement will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, owner of the book "AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the top AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that beats the best Othello American player, and then he serves as an executive at Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee admits to the U.S. government technology competition earlier like the Robotics Challenge for the Mutakhir Defense Research Project and asks when the next activity will be carried out, to help identify the next visioner.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win gifts from the government, Lee says.
"It's not China that takes the lead in the academy; it's a company," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working on the qualifications of universities for AI research for the last few years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policies can also help the United States to support one AI effort.
"I think green cards can be offered automatically for the HDD red holder in the AI field," he said.
The Chinese State Hall issued the following article on July 2017.
The Chinese Science Yayasan provides funds for people in academic institutions just like the way the Yayasan Natural Science and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the lower quality of the academic task in China, Lee says.
Early this year at the U.S. Department of Defence developed the Joint Intelligence Centre, which aims to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White Buildings announced the formation of the Committee's Selection for Integrated Intelligence.
And in this month DARPA (the Mutakhir Defense Research Agency) announced an investment worth $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
For NSF, DARPA recently invested over $100 million a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers asking him to be set up by the National Security Commission for Good Intelligence did not see any further action for months.
Macedonians make a sound download in the country's name range
The Macedonian people made a sound call on Sunday to decide on the country's name change as "the Republic of North Macedonia," an action that will resolve a conflict for a decade with Greece that has pushed its membership bid to be part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a Macedonian province, defends the view that its neighbor's name in the north represents ownership of its territory and has banned its association with NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of a new name, but national opposition argued that changes would damage the identity of most ethnic Slavia Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not give his voice to the general election and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the election results could reach a minimum of 50 percent of the votes needed to make the election valid.
The question on the sound balloon is, "Do you agree to NATO and EU membership by accepting it with Greece?"
Supporting the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argues that it is a proper price to be paid in order to obtain admission into a body such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that are born from the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the young generation of Macedonia so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although there is no legal obligation, many Members of parliament say that they will obey the outcome of their decision - making.
The name change would require a two - and - a - three - hour oral procedure in parliament.
The National Election Commission said that there has been no reports of violations by 1 day.
However, it turned out that only 16 percent of the votes cast, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of the votes cast were registered.
"I came to give my voice for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, an electorate in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and his son Dusko gave their voice to the general election in Macedonia in a series of changes to the country’s name that would open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, has prepared a small stage and pulled the seats in front of the tents that those who will be making the sound call.
"We agree to join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join in honor, not through the maid's door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have a reputation.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of the European integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has a payout rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that most people will agree because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving his voice.
He said "yes" would be "the confirmation of our future."
An opinion poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute on Monday yesterday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of the electorate would take part in the poll - less of the required number.
Another opinion, held by the TV station Telma Macedonia, found that there were 57 percent of the respondents planned to give their voice on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would choose yes.
In order for the sound to be heard successfully, it takes 50 percent to add 1 to the sound.
A failure in the sound supply will represent a first policy challenge to the pro-Barat government since the change in May last year.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City went through the entire Brighton defense to print a score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were awarded Brighton's defense at Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem so easy on his score in the minute to 65.
The attackers in Argentina received an opera in the middle of the field at the start of the match.
He ran among the three defenders of Brighton, before the spider entered the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green people.
He ran through one of the defenders before running ahead of a few other opponents at the end of Brighton's gang.
Then he ran to the left, to Sterling.
That English front liner took advantage of his first trend from the gang to ride the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to defeat Brighton, Mathew Ryan with a tendency to the right gang.
"Aguero fights with some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola City manager to the reporter.
"We've been talking about himself playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're honest with him to print a goal at the time."
But Sterling's the one who gave Sky Blues the first advantage in the game of Prime Minister League.
It's going to happen in 29 minutes.
Aguero received a ball, far in the area of Brighton at the game.
He hit the ball with a long stretch of tension that fell through the left wing of Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little ball puzzle before he led Sterling to a remote post.
Sky Blue front slides the ball in the direction of the ball right before it launches out of the border.
City fights Hoffenheim in the Champions League game at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to run a cracker versus Rockies
With the nationals of the playoff game, there's no more reason to force another match.
But Scherzer, too competitive, hopes to be able to win Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there's still a playoff implication for Rockies, which is the top in a game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies at least didn't get a place after winning a wild-card match against the Nationals with a score of 5-2 on Friday night, but still trying to get their first division class.
"Although we played without winning, at least we can't know the weather in Denver with the audience and other teams that will compete at the highest level of any point I might face this year.
How could I not want to compete in such a game?"
Nationals haven't announced an open match for Sunday, but it's reported that in such a situation, they tend to let Scherzer join the match.
Scherzer, who is about to start reading for the 34th time, had a training session on Thursday and started a Sunday match that was usually used for rest.
Washington's right-hand Pitcher is a 18-7 score change with an average run (ERA) 2.53 and 300 strike-out in 220 2/3 of this session.
The campaigning trumpet in West Virginia.
The president was deeply concerned about the situation in which the Supreme Court ruled, Brett Kavanaugh, when discussing the importance of the Republic's public voice in the middle of the election.
"All our efforts have been fought in November.
Five weeks before he made the most important choice in our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting everywhere for an amazing candidate," he said.
Trump continues, "You see there's a group of radically exciting Democrats, you can see it's happening right now.
And they decide to take back power in any way, you see the evil, the evil of theirs.
They do not care about what they have done, and they have no power or control over them.
The Democrats, he said, are on the mission to "refuse and block."
"And you have seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "worst and evil and cruel and untrustworthy."
He referred to Senator Diane Feinstein, who served on the Senate Praradilan Committee by calling his name, who was warmly welcomed by his audiences.
"Remember what the answer?
Did you burn that document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for it--it's a very bad body language-- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Force party is no longer a public service place.
Now he's being intolerant to anyone who reveals his thoughts.
When Momentum activists in my local party gave a voice to threaten me, it was not surprising.
After all, I was in the last row of Members of Parliament, who were told that our presence was not expected - all because we expressed our views.
My colleague in the parliament, Joan Ryan, got a similar treatment because he strongly defended anti-Semitism.
In my case, the security movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, in Europe, which is ironically the same issue as Jeremy Corbyn faced with the previous leaders.
The announcement to the Nottingham workers' meeting in the east on Friday said that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For almost eight years I became a member of the local Labour Parliament, that is exactly what the meeting of the General Committee on Friday night was.
Unfortunately today, the quality of many meetings and promises about "better, more friendly" politics has not been forgotten for a long time, if that's ever started.
The differences in opinion in the working party are becoming more evident and each opinion is valued by the party’s authority.
It started as soon as Jeremy became the leader, as a former colleague I thought would be able to share the same political view, began to expect me to turn around and accept a position that I would never have received before - either in national security or in the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak openly and care no matter what I say, it will be followed by an effort in the media society that asks for a demonstration, a political coup, to tell me that I shouldn’t be involved in the labor party.
And it's not just me who experienced it.
Of course, I know that I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because of the comments that I have received from the political trend.
I admire my colleague’s professionalism and limitations, who suffers from sexual harassment or racism every day, but never let go.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current political era is the extent to which abuse has been considered reasonable.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the labor party should help develop tolerance culture.
The fact is that we are no longer in a larger church and with every motion "untrusted" or change the party's choice of rules become more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that moved me to keep my head down, not too much to express my opinion, and then I'll say, "Okay."
But I'm stuck in politics not to do that.
Since I joined the 32-year-old Labour Party when I was still a school student, promoted by the treatment of the Thatcher government that resulted in my class of compensating literally falling down, I have tried to fight a better public service for those who really need it - both as a local councillor and a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my political actions, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham will question my political position and things that I do not agree with in the leadership right now.
For those who encourage the mission on Friday, which I can say is when the country moves quickly towards the division of the kingdom, it will endanger our country's business and public service, I don't want to waste time and energy on loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constitution, as a member of the Labour Party or not. I'm proud to serve you and I promise that there's no threat of failure or political policy that will stop me from doing what I believe is best for you all.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Fathers climb up to the top
The last two trials may have been a little boring at the end, but no doubt the father deserves to win today's very comforting tendert's primership.
Now they're in the upper row, the only unbeatable party of ten.
Finally, their superior defenses, and their ability to get the best of opportunities, made Peter Murchie’s home team and coaches have the right to feel comfortable.
"So far we've tried our game, and we're still not defeated so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "The honor of Father, they're better at taking opportunities than we're doing."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but the yellow card for Captain Scotland Rory Hughes, was given to the game by Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to print numbers and Jason Baggot the unconversioned attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's leadership with an altar, before, right in the middle of time, he printed the goal and then did a single attempt to make Ayr's score 17-5 at a time of rest.
However, Melrose began the second half with a good start, and Patrick Anderson’s test, which was modified by Baggot, reduced the chance to five points.
Then there was a long hunt because Ruarid Knott had a serious injury, was thrown out, and from the start of the game, Ayr made a move faster than Stafford McDowall, modified by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then hit the yellow card and again, Melrose made a backup player pay for Bruce Colvine's unchanged attempt at the end of the pressure.
The housekeeper has returned to play, but, when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because of climo unballed, from the line of the guard, MacPherson arrived behind the wounded Ayr.
Climo is replaced, as it has been, almost since the beginning of the match, after Kyle Rowe made a huge tension and disrupted the fifth effort by Gregor Henry.
The Still Game star appears to be ready to pursue a new career in the restaurant industry
The Still Game Cyeran star appears to be ready to move its way to the service industry after it was first known that it was founded as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which was arranged and also built with his former comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The couple have announced that the nine-year-old serial coming is the final episode, and it looks like Kirnan's planning to drive the broadcast directly after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he's the director of the Agriturismo Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a Scottish Sun census indicated that Kirnan was trying to get involved in "a growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
“ The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by the ocean, hopes that the courts will return to the Pacific.
The ship was patrolled in the large square of the launches located in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue sea flag.
The Marine Corps from Titicaca to Amazon was polished with a motorcycle: "The sea is our right to be lawful.
To come back to life is a duty."
Through the south of Bolivia, memories of the loss of a beach line in a bloody 19th - century conflict still well - known — the desire to conquer the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope may have reached its peak in a few decades, because Bolivia is awaiting a court ruling on October 1 after a five-year trial.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope for the results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians who will be watching ICJ's on a wide screen throughout the country hope that the court in Den Haag will support Bolivia's claim that after a few decades of controversy that advocates - Chile's obligation to self-esteem Bolivia's sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, the president of Bolivia's privy who is charismatic about the controversial war for the next year's election - also has a lot of support for Monday's trial.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts are sure that the court can't decide Bolivia's wishes-- and that's just going to change a little if it's possible.
The Netherlands-based United Nations has no power to surrender the territory of Chile, and has determined that it will not determine the outcome of the possibility of a conflict.
That the ICJ position came only six months after the last argument was heard, which indicated that the case was "uncomplicated," said Paz Zárate, an international legal member of Chile.
And still far from continuing Bolivia's claim, in the last four years, it's probably just been in trouble.
"The trouble of accessing the sea has been undermined by the Bolivian government now," he said.
Aggressive rhetoric Morales has weakened the good label of the people of Chile, he says.
Bolivia and Chile will remain at a certain point, but it will be very difficult to keep talking after this.
Since 1962, the two countries have not changed their trades.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of the Bolivian government of Den Haag, rejected the idea of making a decision quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "a wonderful opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of conflict of opinion with profit together," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales was one of the most famous Latin American presidents to use the maritime issue as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never release its right to have access to the Pacific," she added.
"It's an opportunity to see what we need to do in the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons will not happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his first country would never break nuclear weapons if Korea couldn't trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He mentioned the United States to conclude an agreement that was made at a meeting in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comment appeared when the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, appeared almost to begin nuclear diplomacy that had taken place for more than three months after a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri said only a "vessel dream" that by continuing the sanctions and resistance of the United States against the declaration of a Korean war settlement, North Korea would give up.
Washington's keeping an eye on that statement without Pyongyang making an effort to defend the armed forces first.
Good Kim and President Donald Trump wanted to hold a second meeting.
But there is a wide-ranging doubt that Pyongyang really is about the acknowledgement of the weapons warehouse that the country is the only way to secure its security.
Pompeo planned to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for two meetings between Kim and Trump
Show Paris mode shows a lot of recent collections of heads up to the main road near you
If you want to increase the collection of hats or really want to be protected from sunlight don't look for others.
Designer Valentino and Thom Browne issued a large-scale cover series for their SS19 collection at the fashion show stage in Paris Fashion Week.
The really unpracticable hat has been slamming Instagram this summer and these designers have shown creations that delight the stage of the trade.
The great thing about Valentino is the cream hat on it is decorated with a broad blond stick covering the head of the model.
Large - size accessories, including jewels, wizard hats, and even a hat, are not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a group of weird and right past Halloween.
Many of the different colors of his lips have been painted and like Hannibal Lecter compared to high couture.
A creature that resembles a snorkel and a glass of glass, but it looks like a fluttering ice cream.
And if you keep spying on that accumulating mode collection-- then you're being honest.
Mode observers estimate that the large hat collection will be based on the main road near you.
The big hats became a very running train in 'La Bomba', a rubber hat with two-legged straps visible on all the people including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Label recognition behind a very non-practice hat from social media makes a big creation in the beach lanes of the walnut which is almost the same as the swimwear - used with an elusive model.
The hot brown bag that was burned, rubbed with rafia on the edge with a white leather strap, is a great thing from the collection Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous hairdresser Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I hope to see a big hat and a beach bag arrive on the main road for the next summer--because the designer has made a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the request for the big accessory."
John Edward: Language skills are very important to the global population
The Scottish School of Education maintained a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with remarkable results, which is increasingly strengthened by each student and collective success in sports, art, music, and hard work.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Schools Council (SCIS), strive hard to provide the best service for students and parents.
The school is designed to prepare its students for further and higher education, their career of choice, and their role as world citizens.
As a sector of education that can impose and implement school curriculums as expected, we saw that modern language continues to be the eye of popular choice and wanted in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, your speech will go into his head.
If you speak to him in his language, then your speech will enter his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this recent year’s test, we can see that the language is the top position of the league table with the highest degree of graduation in high school.
The total of 68 percent of students learning a foreign language received the A Plus.
The data was collected from 74 SCIS schools that showed that 72 percent of students received the A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent who learned Spanish also received the A.
This shows that schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that children and adolescents will certainly need at the coming time.
At this point, language, as a learning eye option, is held in the same standard as STEM (scientific, technological, resource and mathematics) in the curriculum of modern schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the English Power and Performance Service in 2014 found that for some reasons the employer has to keep fighting in the lobby, 17 percent of the reason is that the language is not available.
As a result, language skills are increasingly being developed to prepare teenagers for their careers in time to come.
As the number of opportunities for speaking is increased, this quality is important in a global world.
Whatever a person's career choices, if they've learned a second language, they'll feel real benefits in the future because they have a life-long ability.
Being able to communicate directly with residents of a foreign country will automatically make a multilingual speaker a top player in competition.
According to the YouTube poll of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them do not speak foreign language well enough to make French and French the only language spoken in two percent, 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning for kids right now is important for now.
Having multilingual ability, especially the language of the countries with a growing economy, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach the most important language in English for a few years to come, 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a number of languages that can be chosen in high school, with teachers who are skilled in this field.
The school in Scotland is intended to provide an environment of study that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It can't be expected that at this point, in the global business environment, language will always be an important aspect of determining the future of the country, so it should be taught in education.
In fact, modern languages must be considered to be "international communication. "
The high school will continue to offer choices, beliefs, and privileges to young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the director of the School of Schools in Scotland.
LeBron will launch a debut for Lakers on Sunday at San Diego
Waiting for fans to see LeBron James holding his debut for Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening of the weekend against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet determined how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote a tweet that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After this week’s initial training, James was asked about his plan for a six - game game for Lakers.
"In my career stage right now, I don't need to do a game for the summer to prepare," he said.
General Trump Police in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a public campaign this evening at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first public close to Trump of the five public loved ones scheduled next week, including stopping in some pleasant places involving Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was insisted that the hearing was suspended so that he could elect the Supreme Court official, Trump meant to build support for the general election of half-time due to the fact that the Republican Party risked losing control of Congress if the hearing was made in November.
How close are the common Trump in West Virginia tonight and how can you look closely?
General Trump at Wheeling, Virginia West is scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the general Trump in West Virginia in a line through a direct broadcast on YouTube.
Trump may be discussing this week's meeting for the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom Kavanaugh, which is becoming more intense after a sexual assault and the Senate's polling will be closed for up to one week while the FBI investigates him.
But the main purpose of this public agenda is to help the Republic’s party to get some time in the face of the November general election.
Therefore, in President Trump's campaign, five generals this week are intended to "support volunteers and supporters because the Republic's party is trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in Senate and DPR," according to Reuters.
"Conference control is very important for his agenda so that the president will as much as possible move to the countries in the parts during the busy campaign season," said Trump campaigner who refused to mention his name to Reuters.
Designed for Wesbanco Arena at Wheeling, the public's hope tonight is to present supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and to pull the leash from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be a second trip to West Virginia in the last month, the country he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, a West Virginia Senate candidate from the Republican Party, who was left behind in the wake of an opinion.
"Not a good sign for Morrisey so that the president should come as an effort to increase her performance in the wake of an opinion," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of Virginia West, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team bravely defends their hope in a single Sunday match
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome session Saturday afternoon is probably needed in this Ryder Cup.
At present, gambling is a sports concept that is the result of completely trusted encounters by players, and there is nothing more than this in competition.
Where do they think they're at right now?
"Before, they were six points high and now four, so I think we thought it was a little moment," Jordan Spieth went through that day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of having four points with twelve more games.
But American team, like Spieth says, feel they have a little moment and they have a lot of things that can be exciting, except for the formation of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them raised three of the four points.
Speeth has played fatally from the tea area to the green area and leads with skill.
The thrill of the spring's celebration is getting louder when its turn comes, making an important punch to make a series match when he and Thomas lose two enemies.
A piece of it that won them on the number 15 that was received with a similar scream, a scream that told you that he was sure America wasn't lost.
"You really have to work harder and worry about your own games," Spieth said.
All these players are gone now.
18 holes to be marked.
The only player with points more than Spieth and Thomas last two days is Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a story that's not about Ryder Cup.
A unique but attractive couple from Europe are four for four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who don't do bogey hits on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoid bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seems to flow well either from this vicious crowd that assures them that they are the players to be defeated on Sunday, and there are no more famous players than Fleetwood and Molinari who will lock Europe's winning potential at sunset on Le Golf National.
It would be better if they were placed in a different hall at the same time.
But it's still too much to talk about Europe's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson reduced Sergio Garcia’s work, the morning fourball hero, when he was introduced to Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the nine front like digging holes that will never be installed by Spanish golf players and this Swedish.
Although, on Sunday no one can help you get out of the hall.
Fourball and foursome is a good show to look closer because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how the strategy can change for a while.
So far, Europe plays better as a team and leads far enough to the final day, but the forum also shows that the U.S. team has the courage to compete despite suspicions by some parties, especially in the United States.
Europe's top 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit on the final day of Ryder Cup after getting up from the fourball and foursome on Saturday by leading 10-6 over the United States.
Two inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead with two victories over Tiger Woods who have to fight to record their points so far in Le Golf National with four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to defend the trophies that were inconvenient in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the Americas' evil team in the morning fourball, making this series a 3-1.
The United States gave more fights in the foursomes, won two matches, but they could not reduce the deficit.
Team Jim Fury needs eight points of 12 single-day games to defend the trophies.
Fleetwood was the first European debut to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, followed by "Mollwood" after a sensational weekend, were just a second couple who won four points from their four openings in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in their four-balls became very strong to defeat Woods that leaped and launched the American Bryson Dechambeau with more than 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two matches on Saturday, once a show of horror, but he had lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes as well as seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, resting at fourballs in the morning, then back to get married to Henrik Stenson in the forum and losing 2&1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopka - one and three worlds.
Europe did not achieve it itself, even though the day was fun and proud of the Western powers of Paris.
The main winner three times Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set up a two-point discount for America on Saturday.
They won 2&1 that attracted Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourball and then back again to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome after losing the first two holes.
It just happened twice in Ryder Cup's history where a team came back from a four-point deficit into a single game, although as a champion of the Fury team, it just needed a series of points to defend the trophies.
However, after becoming the second best for two days, the attack on Sunday back appeared to be going too far.
North Korea says 'no way' will destroy weapons on the one hand without trust.
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations about the continued sanctions that undermined their trust in the United States, and that country was unlikely to break its nuclear weapons on the one hand in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly this year that North Korea had taken "significant steps to show good intentions" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, exposing nuclear testing sites, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Well, we didn't see any proper responses from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation we can't break our own weapons first on one side."
While Ri repeats the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the "step" approach to nuclearisation where North Korea will be punished for taking the step, a significant statement was made that they did not reject completely as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to a statement jointly issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the summit between the U.S. president's office and the North Korean leader who was first held in Singapore on 12 June, at which time Kim promised to "denuclearize at the end of Korea" while Trump promised to secure North Korea's security.
North Korea has officially wanted to end the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States said that Pyongyang had to stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused a call to extend international sanctions to North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization earlier" and increases the pressure with the sanctioning of semen to achieve their purpose forcedly, and even rejects "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri says.
"Perception that sanctions can make us bend our knees is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions will inflame our untrustworthyness."
Ri didn't mention a plan for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leaders in the United Nations this week.
The minister has been attending three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae in the last five months and adds: "If the people who are concerned about this denuclearization are South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization will not reach the end of Korea's path."
However, Ri's speech was dramaticly different from the previous year, when he spoke at the UN General Assembly that designing North Korea's rockets in the U.S. south was something that could not be avoided after "Mr. President of the Devil" Trump called Kim "a man of rockets" on a suicide mission.
This year at a meeting of the UN, Trump threatened to "destruct" North Korea in total, immersing praise to Kim for his courage to take steps to break down, but that big job still has to be done and sanctions must continue to be executed until North Korea does denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months--no problem," he said.
Tigkok and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang on the steps taken.
But the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must be continued firmly and must not fail until we know that complete, final and verifiable declination is complete."
The Peace Council with its voice has increased sanctions for North Korea since 2006 as an effort to stop nuclear programmes and the Pyongyang ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri in the U.S. headquarters and then said that he was going to visit Pyongyang another month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there was actually progress, only North Korea in the clock count calls that he himself made a "claim like a gangster."
North Korea has promised in a meeting with Moon this month to disband the missile site and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes "the right action."
He said that Kim told her to do "the right thing" with her desire was the security assurance that Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard School takes a course on enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all S1 students there more sleep, in an effort to fight macho culture in a study that's developing through 'feeling birds' power caffeine.
An academic found that students at the number one world university often don't know anything if they discuss very basic things about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep specialist at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleepless nights in the study.
"At last came a girl to me, saying, 'Why did I just get to know it now, in the year of my end?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleeping--which surprised me,' she said to The Telegraph.
The course that was first launched this year, explained to the students the essence of how good sleep habits help the results of academics and athletes, and improved their public health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health care at the university, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding a student who had very little sleep all week.
The course for one hour involves a set of interactive tasks.
In one session there is a picture of a room, where students click on a cup of coffee, dishes, sports clothes, and books to get an explanation of the effect of caffeine and light, as well as how athletic results are influenced by a lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep time routine.
On the other hand, experts have explained how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with an interactive icon, then stimulates players to think about their daily routine.
'We know this won't change the student behavior in an instant.
But we're sure that they have the right to know--like things you have the right to know the effect of choosing to suck cigarettes on health,' grew Prof. Chéisler.
Culture is still proud of 'em,' and it's also added that modern technology and increasing pressure on colleges that mean a lack of sleep is a continuing problem.
Ensuring you sleep enough, with good quality, you have to be 'secret weapons' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety - even to avoid body weight gain, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to activate the hunger mode, triggers feelings of hunger.
Raymond So, 19 - year - old California, who studied chemistry and physical biology to help Professor Chéisler plan the course, took one of the classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize the course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hoped that the entire Easter school would be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Chéisler recommended that students consider setting up sleep time alarms, including wake-up alarms, and realize the effects of the 'blue light' posted by the electronic screen and LED lamps, which can push the rhythm of your circuit out of its direction so cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol to lower the mind of the Gerrard army
Finally, Rangers felt the sadness of the day of Dolly's attack on Steven Gerard's third-party team in Livingston.
The Ibrox team has been trying to record their first victory on their way, since the 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team just gave Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points from the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts class.
To attack seven minutes before the first round is over and the rangers who have lost their sense of mind don't seem to balance.
While Rangers are now down to sixth position, Livingstone's up to third position, leaving only the empty set of hibernian.
And so there's going to be a further problem in Rangers' castle after the handlers of the Calum Spence line had to be treated because the head wound after an object was thrown away.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that copied Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Instead, Holt went with Livi 11 the same one that took one point from Hearts last week and he would be happy with the costumes that kissed their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate the ownership of the ball, but Livingstone uses the ball they own better.
They're supposed to have scored in just two minutes when the first shorts of Scott Pittman was thrown through Allan McGregor's gang, but that trigger attracted that big opportunity too wide.
The free venture in Jacobs's custody then met Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only put a wide margin in the back position.
Rangers take control, but there seems to be more hope than confidence in their games at the third end.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he was supposed to have a guardian when he and Steven Lawless were engaged on a fourth-hour mark but on Steven Thomson's side he refused to be compared to the citizens of this country of Colombia.
Rangers only managed to make two throws in the first bay but the previous Ibrox guard, Liam Kelly, almost never had a problem with Lassana Coulibally's headaches and the easy attack of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's opening goals in the 34th minute may be in conflict with his way of competition, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their own hard work.
Once again, Rangers failed to overcome the fatal death tactics of Jacobs inside.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put a ball in Scott Robinson, who remained calm choosing Mega for a simple ending.
Gerard acted when he retired by replacing Coulibally with Ryan Kent, and the exchange gave direct influence when the player put the ball on Morelos, but Kelly, who played the game, was amazed to get out of the line quickly to get ahead.
But Livingstone continued to force the field team to play the exact game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett squeezing all the long balls.
Team Holt was supposed to spread their superiority in the final stage, but McGregor stood up well to drive out Jacobs before Lithgow sinks wide from the corner.
Rangers' replacement player, Glenn Middleton, complains again when he argues with Jacobs, but Thomson turns his face again.
Almanac: Founder of Geiger's Retaliation
And now from our Sunday Morning German page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and there's a lot more to it... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger develops a method to detect and calculate radioactivity, it's a discovery that eventually makes those devices known as Geiger Breaker.
Being a scientific tool since then, Geiger's crackdown has also become a pop culture, as in the 1950s "Bells of Coronado," rocked by cowboy scientists who appear to be less convinced of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger's crackdown, used to find radioactive mineral locations, such as uranium.
When using this earphone, you can actually hear the atomic effects released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, it must be coming up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But that discovery kept her name alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to 'know' evil cells
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'know' the evil cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize evil cells as part of the cure
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient, transforming it into a laboratory.
They can then 'know' the common protein on many cancers and then suggest it again.
A test vaccine shows the promise of a variety of cancers in patients.
A woman was treated with that vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize bad cells, her ovarian cancer was missing for more than 18 months.
This method involves the patient's immune cell extraction process, transforms it into a laboratory so that they can "know" the proteins that are generally present in many cancers called HER2, and then resuscitates the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the United States National Cancer Foundation in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "The result is that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of some types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovarian, porpoise, and colorectal, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
The same approach as patient immunosuppression and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has succeeded in treating one type of leukemia.

Kanye West was promoted to the studio during Saturday Night Live after showing up a mess where he praised President Donald Trump and said he was going to reinstate himself in 2020.
After bringing in that third night's song, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democratic Party and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I used to talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yeah, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL started a show with a sandwich made by Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Judisial Committee about the sexual violence claim made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the West tapes are based on the social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock's trying to fool the West with that variation.
Also, West complains to the viewers that he has had trouble at the back of the stage because of the hat he was wearing.
"They're hiding me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't get out by wearing that hat.'
They're starving me!
And then they say I'm drowning," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West goes on, "You want to see the sink?" says he's going to wear a Superman dress, because this means you can't figure out what I have to do.
Try to love."
The comment produced at least twice by the viewers and SNL viewers seems to be embarrassing, Variety reports, with one person saying, "The whole studio is silent."
West was taken in the last few moments as a substitute for Ariana Grande, a former rap singer's ex-boyfriend Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confuses a lot of people with the look of the song I Love it, dressed as Botol Perrier.
West was supported by the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who wrote tweets: "To one of the bravest souls: LOVE TO HAPPEN TO RAKYAT."
But the director of Karen Hunter's show tweeted that West was "just being himself and that was really great."
"But I chose not to offer someone (by buying music or his clothes or supporting his "art") that I believed to plant and defeat the ideology that was dangerous to my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Before the show, the rap singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, said that he was now "a man officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's trail, he's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
With a rap singer, Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and certainly got the legends of Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then an artist previously known as Prince.
Demand for attempted murder at the Belfast restaurant
A 45 - year - old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was beaten at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The judge was expected to appear before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
This charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
The star Game of Thrones Kit Harington criticises poison masculinity
Kit Harington is known for its role as Jon Snow in the middle-century fantasy series full of violence from HBO Game of Thrones.
But this actor, 31, contradicts the stereotype of macho heroes, he says that the role in such a screen makes young boys often feel that they must be strong to respect.
Talk to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit says he's sure 'there's something wrong' and asks how to deal with a bad masculinity problem in the age #MeToo.
Kit, who just married her game opponent at the Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she felt 'strong enough' in the issue.
'I feel personal, strong enough, at this moment--where is our fault in this masculinity thing?' he said.
'What do we teach men when they grow up, the problems we see now?'
Kit believes that television may be responsible for the emergence of bad masculinity with its very masculinity characteristics.
He continued: 'Who has been a man since birth, and what has he been taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes the boys feel they have to have this particular side to be men?
I think it's really one of the big questions at the time - how do we change it?
'Cause there's obviously something wrong with the kids.'
In that interview he also admitted that he was not going to play in the game of Thrones's puzzle or a game of trolleys at the end of the summer coming, saying that he had 'end with the field of war and horses'.
Since November Kit will challenge her back True West from Sam Shepard, a story about the film producer and his brother, who was a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose as the best reason to get out of the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so to give me a future family, and from here my life begins' his words.
Rose played Ygritte, the love flower of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in a series of fantasy winners of this Emmy award.
This couple were married in June 2018 in the home of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Achievement reports 14% of new cases
An estimated 14 percent of its population live with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people were sent to this country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of the new cases were reported through sex, indicating changes from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through several parts of Tigkok as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people with HIV in this way has decreased to nearly zero, the Tigkok Health Officer said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in Tigkok has increased to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT Tigkok community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in Tiongkok in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people was said to be increasingly important.
Because of the conservative value of this country, the study estimated that 70-90% of men who had sexual relations with men would eventually marry women.
Many cases of sexually transmitted diseases have resulted from inadequate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Tiongkok government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters objected that the staff had leaked data from Senator GOP, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
U.S. Attorney Maxine Waters on Saturday objected that one of his staff had sent personal information to the three Senators of the United States Party to the Web site of parliamentary members.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party pointed out that the claim was motivated by the experts and the "ultra-right wing" website.
"A lie, a lie, a lie, and a lot more evil lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It's reported that the right information includes the address and phone number of the United States Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all of them from Utah.
That information appeared rare on Thursday, sent by unknown people in Capitol Hill during the Senate panel meeting on the unscrupulous charges of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court of the British Kavanaugh.
The Bocoran appeared shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that IP addresses identifying the source of the shipment related to the Waters office and revealing information to one of the Waters staff members, Hill reports.
"This baseless accusation is really wrong and is a false lie," continued Waters.
"My staff member - who is an identity, personal information, and his safety is threatened by false and false accusations - is not responsible at all for the leaking of this information.
It's not a base claim, it's a complete lie."
Waters quickly attracted criticism, including from former White Building Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This resistance means anger," Flescher wrote.
"This shows he doesn't fit to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of something that he does not do, they should not be angry.
They can't leave.
They cannot question the motives of the accused.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who accused critics of being too angry during the Thursday congregation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican party candidate who is trying to push Waters at a half-time election, also shares his views on Twitter.
"If you're right," it says on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "the right authorities and law enforcement entities about this false charge.
"We'll make sure that the perpetrators will be covered," he said, "and they'll be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to one and all my staff."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - a parody of poor Roman Atkinson's eyeballs
Now looking for the significance of Brexit in every new film with the English-based view has become a tradition and it seems to be to re-launch Johnny English comics -- which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the sarcasm of indignation tell us how bad we are as a new opportunity to export to this country?
Anyway, Johnny English, who was looking at a bullet, face-to-face, and the non-competent, has updated his license to screw everything up for the second time -- his name shows more than anything that he was a huge comical creation designed for the cinema area other than English.
Of course, he was a secret agent who, apart from his strange suspicions, had a little Clouseau character, like Mr. Bean's character and a group of passengers who contributed little notes to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Indeed, he is based on the viewer and the international mystery man who ever played Atkinson on the Barclaycard TV advertisement that is now forgotten, leaving a mess behind.
There's one or two sweet moments on this new JE trip.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter by wearing a mid-century red dress and rotating wheels with a quick grip on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy was displayed, but his humor felt powerless and too strange, especially when the film market was "serious" like 007 and Mission Ne believed in entering comedy as a material.
Her humor seems to be intended for the children of adults, and for me there are a variety of strange Johnny English unscientific jokes and the attention of Atkinson's jokes in Bean's personality.
The hot award this year is that England is in serious trouble.
A cybercrime has entered the British super-secret spy web network, revealing the identity of all the British agents in the field, to disappoint the agent who is in charge - unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a proud and hostile prime minister, who has destroyed his entire political population: Emma Thompson acted very well with the character of quasi-Teresa-May but not many of his writings.
His wise counselor gives information that because every active eye has been weakened, he must bring one out of retirement time.
And that means Johnny English's grandfather himself, now employed as head of school in some expensive buildings, but gave a secret lesson about how to do the funeral surgery: there were some good jokes here, when English offered a college of viewers like School of Rock.
English is returned to Whitehall for emergency instructions and is reunited with a long-standing friend named Bough, again employed by Ben Miller.
Bough's married now, he's been tracking a Marine commander, a top-class woman who's been sucking up where Vicki Pepperdine's a bit evicted.
So Batman and Robin, who made a mistake with the Honourable Secret Agent, reacted, met a beautiful mystery woman named Ophelia Bulletova, who was executed by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is worried about falling into the millions of charismatic technologies that admit can solve the problems of English computers: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their ridiculous adventure: enlisting as a servant, they burned a fast-paced French restaurant; they made a mess by sneaking themselves over the Volta's high-end ship; and English launched anarchy when he tried to use the virtual reality headset to make himself comfortable inside the Volta house.
All the stops must have been attracted to the last sequence, but with the courtesy and suspicions like that, there's a few children's TV channels full of everything.
That's quite modest.
And just as the other Johnny English film, I can't think of it: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
The laborer was planning a plan for the British to work four days a week but paid five days a day.
Jeremy Corbyn of the U.S.A. considered a radical plan that required British citizens to work four days a week but paid five days.
It is reported that the company’s owners want to continue to produce relief products through artificial intelligence (AI) revolutions for workers by giving them additional holidays.
He will allow his workers to enjoy the weekend, but he will continue to receive the same reward.
Some sources say that the idea would be 'pass' with the party's economic agenda and the article moved the country to support the workers.
The four - day change was agreed upon by the British Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A source, the senior of the Workers' Association, told The Sunday Times: 'The end of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
'This won't happen in the evening, but four days a week's work is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to rebalance the economy that supports the workers and the party's industrial strategy as a whole.'
The Labour Party is not the first to support that idea, because the Green Party has promised four days of work in a week for the general election campaign in 2017.
However, at present the aspirations are not supported by the entire Labour Party.
The jury said, "Working day in a week is not the party's policy and is not being considered by the party."
Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to complete his vision for the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of 'anonymity' and 'treasures' in utility companies.
The chancellor's article also means, the stockholder in the drinking water company may not get the whole stock back because the government of the Buruh party can do 'disposal' with the reason for the breach.
He also made sure his plan to put workers in the company hall and create an Inclusive Owner's Data that would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to employees, who would be paying annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 minutes" whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has filed a final appeal for his appeal at the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises questions as to whether this finding could affect the senators of the Republic Party to withdraw their support.
In a conversation that was shown on Sunday, Scott Pelley's "60 Minutes" correspondent asked Senator of the Republic's Party.
Looks like Kennedy's more open than his nephew from South Carolina.
"My point, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I would attend the trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, and the charge came up, and he said, "Are you doing it?
He's strong, determined, firm."
However, it seems that Graham’s voice could not be changed.
"My mind has made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and needs a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but what I know is: Brett strongly opposed him," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he calls his name can't verify it.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is meant by the Global Citizen Festival, and has this event done something to prevent poverty?
This Saturday, New York will hold the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that shows a spectacular display of stars, and a successful mission; it will end poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will be a witness to tens of thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy action by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real purpose of this event that ended extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a follow-up to the Global Poverty Project, a group of international lawyers who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get a free ticket for that event (unless you want to pay a VIP ticket), the concert visitor must complete a set of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to world leaders, calling, or other means to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in reaching its goal for 12 years?
Is the idea of giving a gift to a free concert is the right way to invite people to act, or is it just another case called "clickivism" - people feel like they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, moving to set another goal.
It is said that this action has helped the world's leaders to announce a commitment and policy equivalent to more than $37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group has collected 390 commitments and announcements from their action, at least $10 billion of which has been channelled or made money-saving.
This group has estimated that so far, a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world has been.
Some of the main commitments, including The Power of Nutrition, are based in England, consisting of investors and adults committed to "helping children grow up to their maximum potential," promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end the country's gypsum shortage after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, the developer, the national government, and the Global Citizen like you, we can create social injustices about this lack of teeth as a footnote in history," said The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
This group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to increase nutrition for mothers and children in England, the government announced funds for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would cost 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Asking one of the questions on their public answers on their website, "What makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen said, "This will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, just like the civil rights movement and the great anti-apartheid movement that's before us, we're gonna make it, because if we're together we're gonna get stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the stars that appear on this year's show in New York, which will be viewed by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy as a "blocked" to stop the export of Russian energy - Secretary of State
"If necessary" Washington may request assistance from the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, US Secretary Ryan Zinke declared, as reported by Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly believed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where it operated on a legitimate government invitation, was a means to explore a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to be energy maculars, just as they do in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reported.
And according to that office, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the ocean lines are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the actors at the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a nibbling group that called himself "a voice of energy customers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach in agreement with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of efficiency, they are the same.
"Economy choices in Iran and Russia are less, taking advantage of and replacing fuel," he said, as he claimed to Russia as one of the "experts in the field" with an economy based on fossil fuels.
This statement occurred when Trump's government was conducting a mission in order to increase their gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, with a much cheaper choice for customers in Europe.
For that, Trump's officials, including President Donald Trump himself, were trying to lure Germany away from the North Stream 2 oil pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin as a Moscow prison.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 oil pipelines, worth $11 billion, are designed to enhance the oil pipeline capacity of up to 110 billion feet [110 billion m] this cubic, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to this project is just because of economic reasons and is an unfair example of competition.
"I am sure we have the same view that energy cannot be made a tool to exert pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own fit," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US attitude has attracted reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to this project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to interfere with the European Union’s energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I will face a major problem if the third country blends our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider the situation" when calling himself president in 2020, Senator Massachusetts said
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that he would "see the situation" when he became president after a half-time election.
While camping at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted he would consider retiring.
"After the time for women to go to Washington and repair our miserable government, including putting women in a position on top," he told The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'm going to take a look at the situation when I'm retiring as president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump when he was campaigning at the city hall, saying that he "carried this region in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren's bluffing in his criticism of Trump and the leadership of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we make a sound call."
However, a fair opinion on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constitution itself did not want him to resign in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the electorate's "possible" in Massachusetts said the senator should not hesitate, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe opinion.
32 percent of those who supported the campaign.
That led to more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 percent who supported his own efforts and 48 percent who opposed him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party that were discussed with regard to the possibility of exaggeration in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin posted PTSD Track Palin on Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent one year in Iraq after entering the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of violence in the house on Monday night
"What my son experienced, what he'll experience when he comes back, I can connect with other families who also feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers experienced," he said in front of the audience who attended the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin calls his arrest in the room and tells him about his son and other war veterans, "They return with a little different, they return with more intensity, they return and ask him if there is any respect for what they have given, together with the soldiers and the refugees and every other military member of the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with violence in the house of a woman, added with reports of violence in the house of a stepfamily and possession of drunk weapons, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 parts of the country, D.C. supports the challenge of a new policy of torture
Eighteen parts of the country and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that rejects torture for victims who flee from gangs or violence at home.
The government of 18 parts and districts sent a friend-of-the-court letter on Friday in Washington to support suitors against the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of Grace v. In the session's trial called American Civil Liberties Union in August has not yet been declared against federal policy.
He said his brother "and his son is a cruel gang member," he said, but the U.S. officials refused his petition on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
Grace’s country-supported effort describes El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produces a large number of dollars for the United States, as a country facing major gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy is lagging behind the 2014 decision of the Immigration Council, which allowed dark immigrants who fled from domestic violence to flee to their homes.
Major District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy "infringing the laws of the state, federal, and international that have been in existence for several decades."
"Federal law insists that all claims must be decided on the basis of certain facts and conditions related to the claim, and such a prohibition violates principles," the friend-of-the-court letter said.
Further testing gives a brief view that the policy that refuses to enter the U.S. economy has lost its economy, says that it is likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "including the necessary labour force."
The Supreme Court of Jeff Sessions, in June, ordered the immigration judge to give no more bribes to victims who fled from domestic violence and gang violence.
"They are prepared for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear caused by racial, religious, national, or social group membership, or certain political opinions," Sessions said in a statement on 11 June.
It's not meant to ease all the problems -- although all the problems are serious -- that people are facing every day around the world.
A very sad rescue in Palu because of the double-tied victim running in time to find a rescue victim
For those who survive, the situation is getting worse.
"It's a great feeling," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calmed her boy's baby in the middle of a refugee camp in the city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes with a body.
Clean water is very rare."
The people seem to be back to their destroyed home, take the waste of water, try to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and treated in a hospital, the damage caused by an earthquake of 7.5, very severe.
Some of them were injured, including the two Haris, who had broken bones and shoulders, lying outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside the room for severe fatigue.
Her eyes flow when she recounts her feelings again when the earthquake blew up the hotel room on the fifth floor where she stayed with her wife and daughter.
"It's not easy to save yourself.
I think I'm stuck in the breach," Harris told the Associated Press, he added his family to the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry, please, and then shut up.
I didn’t know what it was like for me and my son.
Let them survive."
The U.S. government charges Tiggkok with 'do intimidation' with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after Tiongkok's official newspaper posted a four-page advertisement on a U.S. day that called the profits of the U.S.-Tiongkok trade, the U.S. high-ranking prosecutor for Tiongkok accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump of the United States on Wednesday, the last day, referred to the China Daily supplement in Des Moines Register - a reported newspaper in the country of Iowa - after Tigkok accused of trying to interfere with the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6, a charge handled by Tigkok.
Trump's claim that Beijing is trying to get involved in a U.S. election, which marks what the U.S. officials say to Reuters, is a new phase in the increase in Washington's campaign to push Tiongkok.
Although something common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington are stuck in an ever-increasing trade war, which has led them to increase the rate of imports of one another.
The Tigkok compensation rate at the beginning of this war was designed to attack exporters in parts of the country like Iowa, which supported the Trump Republic Party, said Tigkok expert and U.S.A.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. chief for Tingkok and former governor-in-law leading Iowa, exports major farm goods to Tingkok, says Beijing has lost workers, farmers, and businessmen in America.
Tigkok, Branstad wrote an opinion at Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now delaying the intimidation by running an advertisement on our own free media."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Tiongkok government took advantage of the tradition of freedom of speech and of the highly appreciated press freedom in America by putting a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the street newspaper kiosks here, in Beijing, you will find a ban on different voices and will not see the reality of the different opinions that may be held by the Tigkok people about the difficult economic journeys of Tigkok, remembering that the media is under the control of the Tigkok Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent media in Tiongkok refused to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
The Republika Squad Review points out that the Republic's party leaves the women's election to the mid-term election with a Kavanaugh disaster.
Because the children of the important people on the Republican Party standing and defending the leadership of the Supreme Court of the British Kavanaugh in the face of some sexual assault charges, the analysis has warned that they will see a return attack, especially from women, at the general election of the next half-time.
Emotions over this problem are very high, and most members of the Republican Party have already shown that they want to move on to the soundtrack.
It can't be done," Grant Reeher, a political scientist at Maxwell School, Syracuse University, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected the Senator's move (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake at the end of the minutes to do the FBI investigation would be enough to soften the anger of the elector.
"Wonita won't forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and a national jury speaker for the progressive MoveOn group said on Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protests shouted, "November is near!" when they performed demonstrations in the Senate hall when the Republican Party controlled the Justice Committee to continue progressing in the Kavanaugh petition, which was left behind by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will emerge from the list," political analysis not party to Stu Rothenberg said to the news site.
"The people say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among women's vocalists in the lower polling and election areas, 18 to 29 years old, who because they don't like the president, often don't give a voice."
Even before the Ford public witness, which clearly explained sexual harassment against himself by the High Court’s leadership, the analysis suggests that there would be a subsequent attack if the Republican Party continued to force it to move forward with confirmation.
"It was a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former head of the National Committee of the Republic Party, early last week, to NBC News.
"It's not just about the election of the committee or the election of the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the stand, it's also about how the Republican Party manages this problem and how they do it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to choose the Democratic Party, points to the news channel.
But the Americans would seem to be divided about who to be trusted after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more choice than the last one.
A new bill that youGov made shows that 41 percent actually believe or maybe believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they really believe or maybe believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or really lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After moving from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford and another accused man, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified under oath in front of the Senate Judicial Committee that the drunk Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the high court's chalon showed him his affection when they attended a party when they were in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Browser Plans to Start New Internet to Meet Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that tries to connect Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, joking Berners-Lee said that the meaning behind the Inrupt is "the rule of the world."
"We have to start now," she said from the start.
"This is a historic moment."
This application uses Solid technology that allows people to create "personal online data storage" or their own POD.
These supplies may include a list of contacts, a list of tasks, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The only thing about storing this personal online data is that it really depends on the user who can access what kind of information.
In the company it's known as "personal intelligence through data."
The idea of establishing Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is that the company has the right resources, processes, and skills to help solids be available to everyone.
Now this company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, some of the staff development that is opposed to working on projects, and the code-maker volunteer community.
At the beginning of this week, developing technology around the world can make the decentralization application itself use the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not a total change where all their business models would really be reversed last night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post in the Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt missions are to provide energy and commercial ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has become a voice that has an impact on the neutrality of the network debate.
Even when the Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the Director and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Ulama WW1 Victoria Cross
The only major church in England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior was mentioned in the land of birth 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann, won the award on September 29, 1918, for an attack on the Belgian and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a gunman and never knew that he had won the highest military honor of England.
A warning stone painted by her two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a "scientific symbol" stone that would reveal his grandfather's 100-year-old performance to win appreciation.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "pulling very heavy cattle under a firefight from field weapons and machinery."
Then he hurried forwards to the time line and with "greater courage" leads the front line before he rushes using his own field weapon and launches three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German gunman on October 4, 1918 — just over a month before the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says his grandfather's action is "something I know I can't live but it's a very humble act."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed flowers after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very pleased to be involved in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support of many."
MMA fans spent the night watching Bellator 206, but they even got Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you've spent the night watching Bellator 206 full-time just to refuse to watch the main event.
San Jose's shop has 13 matches, including six on the main card and is being displayed directly throughout the night in English at Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., right when Ggard Moussy and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other, the audience in England was struck when his lips turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciated after they arrive at the special day of the battle.
A fan on Twitter describes the change to the children's cartoons as a "inflicted joke."
"This is the rule of the government, that at 6 o'clock the content is not suitable to be displayed, so it's replaced by the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior president's representative of Bellator's deployment and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa's dad," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker's company said they're going to fix their schedule by counting the audience in England at the coming time.
"Assuming me, if we think about re-launching, I think we might be able to complete it," said Coker.
"But right now there at six o'clock in the morning and we won't be able to fix it until the day of our week, the day of their evening.
But we are trying to do so.
Trust me, at the time of the change, a lot of reverse text and everything is not educated.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government problem.
Trust me, that will never happen again.
We're going to reduce up to five fights from six fights -- as we usually do -- and we're going to try to avoid excessive tensions for fans, and we're going to make it.
This is an unbearable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'slow' related to sexuality
Tom Daley's Olympic explorer said he grew up with a low self-esteem because of his sexuality -- but it gave him motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old man said he didn't realize until he went to high school, that "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, he said, he was talking about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said being an old man makes him less concerned with winning the Olympics.
The usual showkeeper brought this long walker, Kirsty Young, taking a few months off because of the disease.
Looks like the people who were evicted from the first Laverne program, Daley said he felt "less than" all the other people who grew up with him because "don't be socially welcome to like men and women."
He said, “This day, my feelings are different from those of others, and my feelings have become clear to me, so that I may succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they knew about his sexuality.
The two medalists of the Olympics have become the famous LGBT campaign leader and use his appearance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He says he speaks because he feels lucky to live with no consequences and wants to give "hope" to others.
The world champion three times said he fell in love with a filmmaker from the US Dustin Lance Black, who was found in 2013 -- "surprising me."
Daley was married to Oscar, who is 20 years older than he was last year, and she said that her age was not a problem.
"When you have so many problems at a very young age," - he followed his first Olympics at 14 years of age and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone with the same age who had the same suit.
This couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all its prospects" had changed.
"If you asked me a year ago, all of a sudden 'I should win the gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than just winning the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had got tickets to the London 2012 Olympics because he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I can't tell him 'You won't sit on the front row of Dad'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, I finally admitted that he wasn't defeated," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the race.
"What I know is that, this is what I've been spending my whole life--to dive in front of the crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - that had already joined him in his preparations for the Olympics and still made him faint.
Desert Island Disks is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mikkelson changed his role when presented to Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Pégolf Phil Mickelson will record the record on Sunday when he played Ryder Cup at the 47th, but he has to change his role to avoid unpleasant achievement.
Mikkelson, who played in a two-year event to record his 12th record, was suggested by Captain Jim Furyk for the game four balls and four groups on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually did for the United States, the main winner this five times divided time between being a driver and doing his game on that rail, with hope to fix what made him do it.
Never become the most direct golfer at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man is not fit to follow a very strict course at Le Golf National, which routinely gives long and hard sentences for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it wasn't scary enough for Mikkelson, in a nine-day game on Sunday, to face the very exact English champion Francesco Molinari, who had worked together with the new arrival Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four matches this week.
If this American player starts 12 single games with four points below, starts with a hot start, then Mikkelson will prove very important.
Fury expressed his confidence in this man, not because he could say many other things.
"He really understands his role today, kicks and hugs me, and says he'll be ready for the game tomorrow," said Fury.
"He's so confident.
He's Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team last week, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined others, but that was the way they were playing, and that was the way we thought we should go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people."
Mikkelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
It can mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup that will never match his individual record height.
Mickelson played 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven serials, although Fury said that his presence brought some things that could not be said on the team.
"He's funny, he's tough, he's a bitch, he likes to fool people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he explains.
"I think the younger player is having fun with her, too, this week, which is pretty fun to see.
He's given a lot, more than just a game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great superpower can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, Europe's captain, learned from experience that someone who led quite a great deal towards his last single match at Ryder Cup can easily become an unpleasant trip.
Dane made his first debut at the 1997 Valderrama game, with the captain of the Seven Ballesteros team holding five points over America, but just touched the finish line with their nose with the smallest margin, winning 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we get great superiority in Valderrama; we get great superiority in Brooklyn, where we lose, and in Valderrama, where we win, but just," said Bjorn, taking the picture, after watching Class of 2018, won 5-3 well on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow you'll enter a really boring game.
Get out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you get a point on the written board.
We have a target, and the target is to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've been saying for a long time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side -- the greatest players in the world."
Glad to see the players playing in the hard golf field, Bjorn adds, "In this thing I will never go on my own.
Tomorrow is different stars.
Tomorrow, the individual player will progress, and this is a different thing to do.
It's very nice to be out there with a team if everything goes well, but if you're out there playing individually, then your ability as a golfer will be tested.
That's the message you have to give to all the players, get the best out of yourself for the game tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go out to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his player to play better individually than what they did as a couple, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Fürk himself has been on both sides of the final round of the big game, has been part of the team that won the Brookline before it ended with a defeat when Europe did the "Wonderful at Medina."
"I remember all those words," he said, asking how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start it fast as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When the moment goes one way, it'll give you a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We've also arranged a list of players and put people in different ways we feel, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of leading the fight against Rory McIlroy at the top, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players on the top row.
"I'm going with a bunch of people in a row like this because I think I can close all the way," said Bjorn about his only choice.
The new German warship is delayed.
The German Navy's newest guardship should have started in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warship, but it won't be there until at least the next year because the wrong system and its higher cost, local media reports.
The "Reinland-Pfalz" mission, the new Baden-Wuerttemberg master ship, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which is headed by the military.
This ship was supposed to be joined by the Navy in 2014, but the issue of shipping passports had disrupted the fate of the ambitious project.
The fourth Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship, which was notified to the Marine Corps in 2007, will come as replacement for an older Bremen class overseer.
This ship will be equipped with a strong copper, a series of anti-shipcraft missiles, and an anti-shipcraft missile, as well as a number of wireless technologies, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic keys.
Other important features — including longer periods of treatment — were able to use the latest guardship for two years from its original port.
However, the disappearance of this great warship - which was said to allow Germany to highlight its power abroad - will be delayed at the beginning of its term of office, Die Zeit recorded.
A bad - fate F125 guard was announced last year, when the German Navy officially refused to assign the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship’s warehouse in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned to the shipyard after shipping.
It's just a little bit of a reason behind the ship's return, but the German media quoted a number of "hardware and hardware" that makes the warship useless when used for the war mission.
The lack of software is very important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will be operated by ships consisting of 120 sailors -- only half of the working force on the older Bremen class.
It is also known that the ship’s bobot is far too much that will reduce its engine and limit the capacity of the Navy to add to the upgrade in coming days.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with this 7,000-ton bobot is twice as heavy as the German class used in World War II.
In addition to damaged hardware, the cost of production of all the projects — including the training of the ship’s crew — is also a problem.
It's said that it's going up to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) -- it's going up from the beginning of €2.2 billion.
The problem with this new guardship has become very important to keep in mind the latest warning because of the delay in the power of the German Navy.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy actually "ends of the ship with extensive capacity."
The official said that the time of this problem is growing, because the old ships are no longer used, but there are no replacement ships available.
He regrets that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class guards can join the Navy.
National Trust listens quietly to the secret life of the stranger
A recent survey in a garden in the highlands of Scotland aimed at revealing how the gecko uses the earth’s crust in their food hunts.
It is expected that this discovery will give new light on this unique flying mammal’s behavior and will help to guide conservation activities in the coming days.
A study carried out by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will follow the general, soprano, and long-acting chocolate beetles and Daubenton in the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
The special scheme will be placed in the main location around the property to track the event during the summer.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out a cell phone survey using a tumor detector.
The sound expert who analyzes all the recordings will ensure the frequency of calls and the species doing what activity.
Then the map and the habitat report will be made to make images with a scale of detail about their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes this results will reveal which habitat area is most important for the periphery and how each species uses it.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as gardening and the best way to preserve forests for other species and habitats.
The populace in Scotland and all over England has fallen sharply in the last few centuries.
It was threatened by the construction and development work that affected insects and their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as attached stickers to traps and chemical treatment of building materials, and attacks by pets.
In fact, the blind are not blind.
However, because of his habit of hunting at night, his ears were more useful than his eyes in catching the victim.
They're using high-end gem technology to find insects right on their flight path.
NTS, responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, is of great concern to the sea.
They have ten trained personnel, who regularly do surveys, checkouts, and sometimes try to save.
This organization has also set up the first and only natural cloud in Scotland in the Threee farm in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The manager of the David Thompson farm said the farm was a suitable area for the hatchery.
"Here in Treve, we have a good area for the tunnel," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees, and all good habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about the eclipse, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to develop."
He stressed the importance of checking the hatchery before doing conservation in the property, because without realizing the possibility of the destruction of a single shell could kill up to 400 bats and still small, which might destroy the entire local population.
It is illegal for a leper to be protected, killed, or tortured, or destroyed.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland’s Preservation Officer, has moved the public to help.
He said, "We still need to learn a lot about our ancestors and for many of our species that we don't know how their population's fate is."
Ronaldo, who rejected the appeal, was preparing a lawyer for the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls himself a self-defense claim as "false news," and says that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer would demand a German newspaper, Der Spiegel, which published the complaint.
The Portuguese and Juventus were accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was then expected to pay him $375.000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Talking in a video on the Instagram Rings, 142 million followers a few hours after the complaint was reported, Ronaldo, 33 years old, threatening the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the winner of Ballon d'Or five times said to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's the usual thing.
They want to be known by calling my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
The lawyer Ronaldo is preparing to challenge Der Spiegel for the charge, which they call a "suspect report in the field of unacceptable privacy," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz's lawyer said he would ask for compensation as "for moral corruption in the amount appropriate to the severity of the breach, which may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the last few years."
The alleged incident was reported in June 2009 in a suite room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting him at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped him, according to a report sent to the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo kneeled after a reported incident and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" that disappointed only "one percent."
The document says that Ronaldo allowed both of them to have sex, but it was based on desire together.
Mayorga also said she went to the police office and had taken a vision of her injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to settle the case outside the court because she felt "fear of getting revenge" and worried "will be humiliated in front of the public."
This 34-year-old woman says now she's trying to cancel that peace settlement because she's been constantly traumatized by the incident.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid of Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the giant Italia Juve club with a €100 million deal.
Brexit: English 'will regret forever' on the loss of car manufacturers
English "will regret forever" if it loses its status as world leader as a car manufacturer after Brexit, says Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added Toyota, England has told the BBC that if England comes out of the European Union without an agreement, for a while it will stop production at its factory in Burnston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The original Japanese car manufacturer said that if there was no deal, Brexit would lose in the job price.
The factory in Burnston - which produced Auris and Avensis production toyota - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year that 90% were exported to the whole European Union.
"I think it's if English comes out of the European Union at the end of March, we'll see the end of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota's performance in Burnston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed their concern about its exit from the European Union without any agreement on how border trade would run, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said to close Mini's factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem related to what the car manufacturers said was the risk of a market chain if there was no agreement with Brexit.
Toyota production line is run on the basis of the "precisely time" production principle, with a layer that enters every 37 minutes of cooking in England and the European Union for cars made according to loading.
If England leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a disturbance in the border, which, according to industry, could lead to overcrowding and a lack of capacity.
It will not be possible for Toyota to keep more than one day in his factory in Derbyshire, the word of company administration, and thus production will be stopped.
Clark says Chequers Theresa May's plan to associate with the European Union in the coming period is "calibrated precisely to avoid border checks."
"We need to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only to enjoy success at this moment, but for us to get this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio 4 program today.
"It's not just from Toyota, but also from other producers, that we really need to be able to continue what's already been a very good marketing chain."
Toyota can't say how long the production will be stopped, but clearly in the long run, warns that the cost of production will reduce the factory's power and eventually lose in the job cost.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the director of the United Workers' Association at the factory, said his members are becoming more concerned: "Because of my experience, so late, this work will never return.
The government's speech says, "We've put together an accurate and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union at the coming time."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein might be back in the dark, the middle of the White House.
The high-risk meeting of Donald Trump with the high-level representative of Rod Rosenstein could be "re-re-re-sponsored" because the battle for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh still continues, the White Building said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the special consultancy work of Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian handouts in public elections, the relationship between the Trump and Russia assistants, and the potential that hinders justice by the president.
Whether Trump was gonna fire the high-level or not, which would endanger Mueller's freedom, has been shooting rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been discussing using telegrams to record talks with Trump and possibly broadening the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein objected to the report.
But the other day he went to the White House, in the middle of a report that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the U.S. office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose to no" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was called back to avoid interference with the Senate justice committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI's investigation for a week on a complaint against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the hearing of the Senate.
Press Secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared at Fox News Sunday.
Asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "It's too late for that meeting to be fixed, it can be this week, I can see that it's going to be another week good to remember what's going on in the grand court.
But we see it and I always want to deliver the latest news to the press."
Some reporters will object: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White Building since September 10.
The director of Chris Wallace's show asked why.
Sanders said it's rare not because it doesn't like TV reporters "who try to attract attention," though, he said, "I don't agree with the fact that they're trying to attract attention."
Then he urged that the direct contact be made between Trump and the press.
"The president did more questions directly than the previous president," he added without mentioning the evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The meeting will still happen, says Sanders, but "if the press has a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been doing it more often and you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it'll replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
The trumpet routine asked questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with high officials.
The solo press conference rarely happens.
This week in New York, the president may be showing his reasons, making a free appearance and sometimes strange before the press gathers.
Health Secretary wrote to European Union workers in NHS Scotland about concerns about the Brexit problem
Secretary of Health wrote to the staff of the European Union working in NHS Scotland to express their appreciation for the country and hope that they will continue to work here after the Brexit problem.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until England withdrew from the European Union.
The government of Scotland has made a commitment to meet the cost of regular status education for citizens of the European Union who work in the services transferred.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations between England and the European Union on this suicide still continue, close to the decision expected in this summer of the fall.
However, the British government has also prepared for the possibility of a scenario without an agreement.
I know this must be very disturbing for you all.
That is why I now want to point out how much I appreciate the contributions of each member of the staff, who have left their homeland.
Fellows from all over the European Union, as well as others, have gained valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services, and benefit the patients and the society we serve.
Scotland really is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie Introduced Surgery After Healing Headaches
Backstage Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after having suffered head injury at 31-27 of Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Coaching the head of Tennessee State, Rod Reed told the injury reporter that happened shortly before the baby was finished.
"He came to the back of the field and fell down there," said Reed.
Medical training and strength gave Abercrombie oxygen in the back of the field before putting it in the den and taking it to further evaluate it.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris adds that "there are no details about the type/level of injury that has been experienced" and the State of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurs.
Abercrombie, the college of these two red cheeses, was in his first spring with the State of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five bikes on Saturday before he got out of the game, which made his total bike during the summer to be 18 bikes.
Foreign buyers will enjoy higher material costs when they buy property in England
Foreign buyers will be awarded higher material costs when they buy property in England, along with additional money that will be used to help the scientists according to the new Tory plan.
This step will hold back Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The cost of this material will be paid to those who do not pay taxes in England
The Finance Department expects to collect up to £120 million a year to help the scientists
Foreigners will be awarded a higher salary when they purchase property in Britain — including additional money that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce it today.
This step will be seen as an effort to keep Jeremy Corbyn’s success in reaching out to the young electorate with a promise to provide a more secure and secure society.
The cost of material goods will be paid to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in England, along with additional money that motivates the government to fight earthquakes.
The additional costs are additional to the current material cost, including a higher level known two years ago for the second house purchase and for rent to reach three percent.
The Finance Department expects this movement to rise to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built property in London was purchased by non-English residents, causing price increases and making it more difficult for the first buyer to put his feet on the ground floor.
Many rich areas in this country - usually in the capital - have become "the ghost city" because many foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called for a tax check to help more young people have their first home.
He accused a large construction company of maintaining the property price by buying land but not using it, and pressured Mrs. May to ignore the quota for homes that were not to be used to repair the "combination plot" in England.
Corbyn has announced a series of reforms in the area of attractive companies, including rental surveillance and ending the "without guilt".
He also wanted to give more power to the halls to build new homes.
Mrs. May said, "I promised last year that I would dedicate myself to the prime minister's duties to restore the British dream - that life should be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our crazy corporate market.
English will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is not the right thing for an individual who is not living in England, as well as a foreign - based company, to buy a simple home for the people of England who are already working hard.
For many people dream of having a house becoming something very far away, and the conduct of the ignorant is still real."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the team of Scotland'
Boss Sunderland, Jack Ross says "the main ambition" is to be Scotland's manager at some stages.
This 42-year-old Scottish player enjoys the challenge of re-establishing the North-East Club, which currently holds the third level in the Single League, a selection of three points from the top.
He moved to the stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Prime Minister's League last summer.
"I want to rob my country as a player.
I got a B hat and it was him," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I'm big and often watching the Scottish team at Hampden with my father as a child, and it's always something that attracts me to come back.
But that opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management."
Sunderland manager before Ross, among others, Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
This former Alloa Athletic boss said he didn't feel as good as following the big names in that whole club, after he previously refused Barnsley's offer and Ipswich Town.
"To me, the success of this time will be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because the structure and facilities in this club are no longer suspected of being in the Premier League," he said.
"Don't make it easy to be there, but I might just see myself as a successful person here, if I could bring this club back there."
The Ross career in team management was only three years, after some time as a boss assistant in Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a training staff in the Hearts.
And then he helped Alloa recover from the third position, and turn St. Mirren from the lower rank as the winner of the championship next summer.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It's probably the passage I have to go through," he recalls when he took Alloa.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds really weird because I'm fine, looking for a decent way of looking for a price, and enjoying some good things.
But playing can be difficult.
A lot of things you have to spend every week.
I'm still experiencing it in the matter of working pressure, but in management it feels good.
I always want to lead something and now I do it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt during my adult life."

The summer heat wave has increased the public income in England that is fighting to survive, but more exerts pressure on the restaurant network.
The numbers show that the public and bar groups saw sales of a total of 2.7 percent in July - but income of a total of 4.8 percent in the restaurant.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, who compiled these figures, said: "The bright sun and the British participation in the World Cup longer than expected, July will follow the same pattern as the previous month of June, where public income is up to 2.8 percent, except for a restaurant that gets a hard-hit.
The sales of the so - called 1.8 percent of the restaurants in June will worsen in July.
Public and bar sales selling drinks so far appear to be the strongest compared to what happened at the restaurant down.
The public who sell food also suffers from the heat of the sun, although it does not separate the restaurant operator.
Looks like people just out for a drink.
Sales all over the pub and the mall that sells drinks up to 6.6 percent for this month, selling three percent down food."
Paul Newman, a recreational analyst and RSM hotel say, "This has been on the train we've seen since April.
The weather and impact of social or sports events continue to be the biggest factor in market sales outside the home.
No wonder that a group of restaurants continues to fight to survive, even though sales of a total of 4.8 percent a year will be very painful over the current cost pressure.
The long heat season should not come at the time when the food operator sells has bad times, and the time will tell you whether the good enough heat we enjoyed in August will give you some needed rest."
The total sales growth in the entire public and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, showing a bridge on the market launch.
Industrial sales of the Coffer Peach Tracker for the public sector, the bar, and the restaurants in England collect and analyse the Chinese data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is a no-for-go industry gap.
One of the five children has a secret social media account they hide from their parents.
Survey reveals, one of the five children still 11 years of age-- have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the development of the "False Insta" page
This report has raised the anxiety of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account to show to parents
One of the five children is still 11 years old — making social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a "False Insta" account development -- a reference to a photo-sharing site in Instagram.
That report has raised the anxiety of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they operate a "main" account that has been cleaned to show parents, while they also have a personal account.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found a teenager who asked others to "strengthen me."
Research by the British Digital Association and the Conference of the Head of the School of Men and the Head of the Women's School (HMC) from independent schools found 40 percent of students 11 to 18 years of age have two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep a personal account.
HMC head, Mike Buchanan says, "This disturbs so many young children that they try to create an online space that their parents and teachers cannot find."
Elid Doyle will be "a voice for athletes" in the Scottish Athletics.
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Chamber as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is an athlete and the most respected Scottish field and leader Ian Beattie described this movement as a great opportunity for those leading the field of sports to benefit from his many experiences at international level for the past few decades.
"Eilid is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him into the hall," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I acted as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sports in Scotland."
American athletes, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres race at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, among the total four gold medals of the Olympics and are now the BBC’s expert, are now unable to walk after a momentary ischemic attack.
He writes on Twitter: "This month I suffered strokes.
I can't walk.
The doctor says only the time I can determine if I can recover and to the extent that it recovers.
It is a very difficult job to recover completely, to learn again how to walk, and today to perform postgraduate training!
Thank you for sending a message of enthusiasm."
A breast pump advertisement that compares mom to a cow has spread opinions in the online world
The breast pump company has shared its views in the online world with a newspaper comparing mother to a cow that is being slaughtered.
To mark the launch of a product called "the brain pump that can be used with the first silence in the world," the consumer technology company Elvie issued a advertisement inspired by an artist's music video to show the freedom given this new pump to express a mother.
Four moms danced in the cave full of straw and followed a song that made sense like this: "Yes, I'm divorcing myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice this is not a twin, it's my brain."
It goes on with refraining: "Out pump, out pump, out pump, out pump, out pump, out pump, out pump, out milk my woman."
However, the advertisement published on the Facebook page of this company has led to online controversy.
With 77,000 times seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received a wide range of reactions from the mirror, with a lot of saying this makes the dairy industry a "growth".
"A very bad decision to use a cow to advertise this product.
Just like us, a cow must also be pregnant and born to produce milk, unless the baby is stolen from them in a few days after giving birth," wrote someone.
Elvie's breast pump is very passive in BH following (Elvie/Mobu)
Another comment: "The trauma that can be understood well for mothers and babies.
But why don't you use it to announce a breast pump for the mother to keep her baby safe?"
Others add, "A missing advertisement."
The other was defending the ad, with a woman admitting that she found that song "luccu."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'll buy it if I still get it.
Cleansing makes me feel exactly like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I'll get it.
It's a brilliant product," wrote someone.
Some of them say, "This is a pleasant news for mothers who often go to their place of employment or to toilets and who feel like a cow."
It's not an advertising that praises or even judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with hidden pumps inside their arms.
The basic concept of this campaign comes from the surveillance of many women who spy on ASI who say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is really healthy, without cables or cables and passports in the bra followed by, which gave women freedom to move, holding their babies, and even going out as they crawled.
Ana Balarin, a friend and ECD at Mother's, commented: "Elvie's pump is the product of a passport that is worthy of being launched with conviction and provocative.
By comparing the image between expressing women and cows our cows want to attack the ASI and all its challenges, and by showing them how to comfort and enjoy the full freedom afforded by the new pumps.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump was the main news.

Millions of Migraine Children Move Quietly to the Texa Border Camp
The number of migrant children detained is increasing, although the monthly border crossings remain unchanged, most of the result of the harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump government, which are challenging childcare with sponsors.
Basically, most of the sponsors themselves are non-documented immigrants, and fear that their own ability to stay in that country will be jeopardized by making progress to save children.
The risk is increasing in June, when the federal government announced that the sponsors' calon and other adult members of the house have to hand over their fingerprints, and the data will be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer in the area of Immigration and Bea Cukai, witnessed in front of Congress that the bank had arrested dozens of people who had applied for child support under the age of 19.
The bank then ensures that 70 percent of those arrested do not have a record of crime.
"Almost 80 percent of those who become sponsors or members of the sponsor group are illegal in this country, and most of them are evil foreigners.
That's why we keep hunting those people," said Mr. Albence.
In order to process children faster, officials introduced new rules that some of them were required to attend in court within a period of one month after being arrested, not after 60 days, which became a previous standard, a statement by the shelter workers.
Most of them appear through videoconferencing, not directly, to request their legal status to immigration judges.
Those who are considered unworthy of receiving help are directly deported.
As long as the children are detained, they may be more anxious or under stress, so that they may increase their violence or escape, as they speak of the workers of shelter and the report of the system they have received in the last few months.
The lawyers say that the anxiety is increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, which are signs of a child who is struggling with a tendency to be ignored, because of its size.
They say that moving children to the camp city without giving them enough time to emotionally or saying good-bye to their friends can exacerbate the traumas that have already been fought.
Syria asked the 'sitting forces' of the United States, France and Turkey to retreat immediately.
Arriving in the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return, although the country's war has now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as prime minister's representative, said a foreign army occupying Syria illegally, for reasons of combating terrorism, and "will be handled with all due respect."
"They must retreat as soon as possible and without imposing any conditions," his expression to the chauffeur.
Moualem points out that "war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than a million refugees from their homes.
He pointed out that Damascus will continue to "restrict this holy war until we clear all Syrian territories" of the terrorist group and "the presence of an illegal foreign army."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, especially training and influencing Kurdish and Syrian Arab troops against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in war - torn areas.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moualem insists that they return immediately, and he blames "some Western countries" for the fact that "spreading extraordinary fears" that motivate refugees to move further away.
"We've asked international society and humanity to facilitate this recent process," he said.
"They're policing what's supposed to be a whole humanity problem."
The European Union and the United States warn that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
U.S. diplomats said the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the Great Idlib Rebellion Temple has created the last opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented major attacks by the Syrian troops supported by Russia in that province, where there are three million people living.
But Moualem pointed out that the treaty had a "clear date" and gave rise to the hope that military action would target scholars including fighters from the Nursa Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who would "be drowned."
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to speed up the first meeting of the new committee, consisting of government and opposition members, to make the war-laws for Syria and open the way to a general election.
Moualem sets out the conditions of the Syrian government's accession to the committee, stressing that the panel's work should be limited to "to inspect the latest legal loops," and warns against interference.
Why Trump will win Second Period
According to that logic, Trump will win the general election again in 2020, except for the many liberal spectators who hope, the charges and scandals will end his presidency today.
No one doubted, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
So far, there are no signs of fatigue for the viewers.
Since 2014, CNN's main operating hours have increased by more than twice as much as 1.05 million and MSNBC nearly three times as much as 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primary watch, an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has sat on the top of cable TV with 3.5 million viewers on the night of the main news.
"This is an enthusiasm that makes people interested in being something that is not yet understood," said Neal Baer, the director of the ABC drama "Designed Survivors," about the cabinet secretary who became the president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Bad Facts Going Into Hollywood Boys," has another theory.
He remembered a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he'd give his voice to Trump.
Why?
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell to me.
There are values of entertainment in a conflict.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the stories that come from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and restore the global economy.
In turn, a privilege that can only be felt by the most special viewers.
In this respect, not just being a citizen of a country that knows when you find yourself watching the panel of experts debate the use of the source "back" Bob Woodward for his book entitled "Fear," wore a leather jacket for Paul Manafort worth $15,000 ("a tight dress with pride," The Washington Post) and the implications of a terrible description of Stormy Daniels about Trump's anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario again.
"The part of the policy that he does makes it the same as a real event that comforts you every night," says Brent Montgomery, executive head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and created "Pawn Stars," about the actor's performance and the history of Trump's day (chosen enemy with NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).

He was unable to release himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was prepared to face the Senate Court and then to the Supreme Court according to his balance.
"I remember when we held all the crazy shows on that day and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of the West War," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it's like a joke, but it turns out they're right."

A lot of money from outside won the election contest at the most tightest time in the White Building
Just think of Pennsylvania 17 receiving a flood of money, the refurbishment of the convention districts that provided two survivors in the same session.
The Pittsburgh district was recently re-established, calling Conor Lamb from Rep. The Democrats - who won the seats in another district through a special summer election last year.
The Lamb has advanced against another survivor, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th old Pennsylvania district, which is suffering from the new Pennsylvania 17 district.
These maps were recast after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally on the part of the Republic party.
The competition in the new Pennsylvania 17 district has resulted in a huge campaign between the financial side of the big party, the Democratic Congressional Committee Campaign (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee Campaign (NRCC).
The Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a small victory in the Maret special election that was held for the 18 Pennsylvania Congressional District.
The course has been held by the Republican Bureau for over a decade, and President Donald Trump wins the district with 20 points.
Politicians sent the Democratic Party a little higher.
A.S. Balanced El Salvador's Punishment for Supporting Cows, Then Back
Diplomatics make sure that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, giving little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and ordered hotels in Panama until the team was expelled by my partner from the Trump Management Team.
The Department of Foreign Affairs has decided to withdraw the head of the American diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the latest decision that no longer recognises Taiwan," Heather Naurut, the department's jury, posted in a statement earlier this month.
However, the punishment was considered only for El Salvador, who received assistance of some $140 million from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development support, and economics.
The resulting judgment, which covers the collection of financial assistance and visa waivers, will harm the Middle American country and raise the level of unemployment and murder.
When internal meetings took place, North and Central American officials held high-level conferences focused on security and economic prosperity to attend the same year-long meeting that was considered a step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials pointed out that they wanted to hold a conference, to effectively end the review for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at that conference, when it is scheduled for mid-October, as an import signal made by the government in that vicinity, by diplomats.
And the third American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing new counsel or severe punishment from Washington.
A White Building jury for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate presented by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations of this unclear situation.
Their statements were reinforced by external analyses that were closely related to the government and were also discussed in this inexplicable way.
Study Edition
The other surprising story is a special advice report by Robert Mueller on the possibility of the execution of Mr. Trump's treason, which is currently very important in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's report also discussed his investigation into whether the Trump campaign is engaged with Russia in attacking our general election.
When the Congress moves its hands, Mr. Trump will be called upon to assume responsibility for himself, as soon as he prepares to go back to the electorate, and may eventually be a jury of his fellow believers.
So there's still a lot to be done, and I don't mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's government is unable to be avoided, or otherwise, in Europe.
There are choices that we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to take a stand against Hitler, if only the West had fought against him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and we have missed the opportunity to avoid the years of further construction.
The beginnings of history centered on such a journey, and the speed of democracy or imprisonment cannot be avoided.
Today, the United States faces some of these changes.
What should we do if Trump fires the Chief Justice of Rod Rosenstein, the one who watches the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since then reports that, last year, he suggested that the president's silent records be recorded and felt that he was not worthy of the president's office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was wrong.
"How do we respond if the F.B.I. investigation that has just been requested by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is sent to the Supreme Court if there is a strong charge of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And besides, are we going to give a half-time voice to Congress asking for Trump's responsibility?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will continue to deteriorate over time.
But I believe we'll make it, because the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once inhabited my great estate.
He survived, then immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, asked me to light the candles on the table that wrote the swastika.
By leaving that legacy to me, how did I lose hope of our future?"

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans felt optimistic during the race against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers present the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, scattering victory over Austria, following good results in Spain against Villareal early this month, will strengthen their position to leave the European G League Group.
The shoulder blades made the middle of Graham Dorrans can't be seen in this first spring until the result of Volume 2-2 against Villareal, but he's sure that Rangers can take advantage of the result as a stone to greater hope.
"This point is very good for us because Villareal is a great team," said the 31-year-old player.
"In this game we're sure we can get something and go with a single point.
In the end, we might be able to do it, but we think the results may be fair.
In the first section, they may look better, but in the second section, we get up and become a better team.
After Thursday, tonight is another great European day.
We hope to be able to watch the three points even though they will be a difficult match because they have good results in their last match, but, with support behind us, I'm sure we can keep moving forward and get positive results.
Last year, we had a hard time, because it happened because of my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there's a very good hope in this club.
It's a good shot and the kids really enjoy it. It's a good training.
May we now be able to develop, put the past behind us and succeed."

Although it turns out that surveyors have a clear idea of how they want to be treated, not many people have talked to their family about it.
Half of the people in the Nationalwide study discussed long-term care costs with their spouse.
Just 10 percent of them say they're discussing this with their kids.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's nothing to do to start the investigation," said Holly Snyder, president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Business.
Here's the time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: you won't be able to prepare your own family to give care if you don't tell your wishes first.
Talk to your family’s counselors, where and how you get treatment, why your choice will mean that it is very important to determine the cost.
Get your financial advice: Your advisors can certainly help you by showing you how to pay those fees.
The services you choose for long-term care include the traditional long-term insurance policy, the hybrid cash insurance policy that guarantees these costs or ensures yourself with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Show your legal documents: In case of a pending legal dispute.
Immediately show the power for your health care, i.e. someone you believe to ensure your health care and ensure that your wishes are realized by professionals when you cannot communicate.
On the other hand, the letter of power in the matter of money should also be considered.
Someone who trusts to manage all your financial decisions you have to choose, except to make sure you pay your bill if you can't.
Always remember with every little detail: Just imagine when your elderly parents are in emergency health and on their way to the hospital.
Are you ready to answer a number of questions about treatment or allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready to answer.

A man shot a windgun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a windgun on his way home from a party.
Those 40-year-old victims were in the Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when several times shot about their breasts, their stomachs, and their hands.
The shooting event was described by an officer at around 02:30 BST, and it was said to be "a random event."
The victim did not see who attacked him.
The injuries suffered by the victim did not threaten his soul, and a number of witnesses have been tried by the police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis across Indonesia
Earthquakes and tsunamis so horrifyingly invaded the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, have destroyed a few 384 souls, the number of officers, and the number of victims who died is expected to increase.
It was decided that the communication would make the officers who provided the trouble relief get information from the Doggala Regency, a region north of the city of Palu that is closer to the centre of the earthquake that hit with the power of 7.5 Richter scale.
In Palu, after a disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are a number of major facts about the city of Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located on the edge of the narrow west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, this city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
In the meantime, it was more than 300 km (180 miles) from the shoreline on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
This province, which is the administrative region under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 souls in 2017.
Andalan's economic eyes in the South Sulawesi province are looking for fish and vegetables, especially on the coast of Dongala.
However, the existence of nickel building is also important in this province, although most of the population is located in Morowoli, across the Sulawesi coast.
Listed in the last 100 years, Palu and Dongala have been sent to tsunamis several times, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Management Board.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in tsunamis and hundreds of homes in the city of Dongala.
In 1996, nine people died in tsunamis in western Dongal.
In a seismic way, Indonesia is placed on the Pacific Fire Cincinn, and as a result, earthquakes will occur in an orderly manner.
A number of shocks and great tsunamis that have lasted for the past few years are as follows:
In 2004: 26 December, Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake, just on the west coast of the province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered tsunamis in 14 countries, until it destroyed 226,000 lives along the coast of Samudera Hindi, and more than half of the victims died in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, a violent storm struck the west coast of Sumatra.
In the Nias Island of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 against the southernmost island of Java, Indonesia, triggered tsunamis on the southern shore and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: The city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatran province, was hit by a force of 7.6.
The victim died of more than 1,100 people.
2010: One island in the island of Entawai, after Sumatra, was also hit by an earthquake of 7.5, which triggered a tsunami of up to 20 feet (10 m) in length and some 300 people.
2016: Pidi Jaya, Azeh, also experienced shock and destruction, as well as the horrors of people who remembered the devastating effects of the earthquake and tsunami that killed in 2004.
Although this time there was no tsunami, more than 100 people died because of the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, which is considered a tourist island, has also experienced a massive earthquake that kills more than 500 people, most of whom are on the north side of the island.
The camp was overrun by thousands of buildings, while thousands of tourists were thrown in.
The Son of the Most High was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for president, has been arrested with a series of attacks.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, prevented domestic violence from reporting and combating attempted arrests, such as a report by the Alaska National Police on Saturday.
According to a police report, when a woman's acquaintance was trying to call the police to report a suspected crime, she picked up the phone from the woman.
Palin was handed over to the Mat-Su Prapedradilan Prison, with $500's no guarantee, as reported by the KTUU.
As reported by the news network, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, declaring himself "no offense, he's sure" when asked about his defense.
Palin faced three minor Class A violations, which could lead to imprisonment for a year and a fine of $250,000.
In addition, he was also charged with the charge of Class B, with the punishment of one day's prison and the sentence of $2,000.
For Palin, this isn't the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the case.
The case is now referred to the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of preventing reports of domestic violence, and of holding firearms in a drunken state, which also relates to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of looking at his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was threatened by a group of vets that linked her son’s violence to PTSD as a result of his work in Iraq.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of victims died
On Friday, the island of Sulawesi, in Indonesia, was subjected to a severe earthquake that killed at least 384 victims.
A 7.5 - scale earthquake that has potential to trigger tsunamis has swept thousands of homes.
The power supply and communication networks are broken, and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake then struck the middle of Sulawesi, which lay east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Video-videos showing how intense the moment of disaster is going through social media.
Hundreds of middle-aged people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, when the tsunami broke the beach.
The federal prosecutor allowed a death sentence that rarely occurred to suspect a terrorist attack at NYC.
The federal prosecutor in New York allowed the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- that sentence was rare and had not been committed in the country of the federal crime-related state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, was supposed to have been attacked by hitting the truck he was hired from Home Depot on foot and bicycles on a bicycle track along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, October.
In order to allow this death sentence, the magistrates must give evidence that Saipov "willfully" kill those eight victims and "willfully" cause serious bodily harm, based on a statement of intent to lower the death penalty, sent to the South New York District.
On the basis of the documents of the court, the two charges enabled them to be put to death.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov's federal jury arrested with 22 charges, including eight counts of murder in an attempt to obtain a warrant, which was usually used by federal officials in the event of organised crime, as well as charges of violence, and in an attempt to disrupt the motor vehicle.
According to the prosecutors, the attack requires "substantial planning and early detection," as an image of Saipov's crime done with "slow, cruel, and inadvertent."
As stated in the statement of intent, "Sayfullo Habibullahevic Saipov has caused harm, danger, and loss of family and friends from Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five victims of the incident were visitors from Argentina.
Counted one decade since the South New York District filed a death sentence last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of murdering two drug addicts, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last execution of the death sentence at the New York federal court in 1953 was held in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were found guilty of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
That couple, Rosenberg, died in a power plant on June 19, 1953.
On the basis of the documents of the court, Saipov, who was from Uzbekistan, did not show that he felt sorry for the day and month after the attack.
When questioned by the investigator, he said that he was happy about what he had done, the police.
Saipov also revealed to the authorities that the attack he did was inspired by the video ISIS that was seen from his phone, such as the charges.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, the police station.
He stated that he was innocent of 22 charges against him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said "clearly disappointed" about the prosecutor's decision.
"For us, the decision to execute death rather than receive a sentence of guilt for life in prison without a guarantee of release will only lengthen the trauma of the people involved in the incident," said Patton.
Previously, Saipov’s defense team had appealed to the authorities not to have a death sentence.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for Brexit's negotiations, Tory MP says.
Nigel Farage called for 'encouraging people' today in prosthetic action at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said that politicians must 'smelt its heat' Eurosceptics - because one of the parliamentarians, Theresa May, suggests to join in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative group supporter Peter Bone said to road action in Birmingham that England 'should come out' right now if Farage had served as Secretary of Brexit.
However, the challenge faced by May in the reconciliation of his shared position has been undermined by Remain Tories supporters who join in separate protest actions threatened Brexit in that city.
Prime Minister fought to defend the Chequers compromise plan to remain on its path even though in the middle of the Brexiters, Remainers and the European Union.
The co-sponsored countries stressed that he would be moved to move forward to reach agreement with Brussels, even though he had a bad back-up reaction - and forced Eurosceptics and Buruh to determine the choice between his original package and the 'disquieting'.
Bone told the crowd Leave Means Leave in Solihul that he wanted to remove the Cheques.
The result, that Farage should lead a team to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"If the responsibility remains with him, we'll be out now," he said.
Members of Parliament Wellingborough said, "I'm ready to stand up for Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers."
His expression, he only showed his opposition to the European Union: "We do not fight in the war of the world to be submissive.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.'
Bone suggests that the public opinion has potential to bring about changes since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people's thinking has changed and wanted a regular condition, it's not true at all."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins, also involved in the mass action, posted to the reporters: 'Just, I want to say, "Yes, Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Chequers are not popular among the generals, but the Opposition will not choose them, because they are not popular with our parties and our activists who really went down the road and made us selected in the first position.
Our requests, get rid of the Chequers and start listening to us.'
And by the word of the prophet, he said, “The Minister will keep their work when they have made a promise.”
Farage said that political demonstrations should be denied so that they can "suffer its heat" if they want to violate the 2016 referendum decision.
"This is the most precious time of our faith - our people and our political people," he said.
They said, "We are here today, and we will not let you go."
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: 'I want you to make our political people, who are prepared to disobey Brexit, also feel its heat.
"We are moving the soldiers of this country, who will conquer us in Brexit, and never give up until the British is in power, reign and glory."
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before taking action in the city center for two hours.
The active finish line appears to be depicting the Tories Against Brexit after the line was printed at the end of this week.
Comrades in the labor line, Lord Adonis, tricked the Conservative group on the security issue of their party's application when the conference was opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can control the IT system and all the technologies for Canada, whatever, for the sake of anti-trafficking limits, in the free trade chain in Ireland," it grew.
“It’s a show.
There's no good Brexit anyway,' it grew.
Warren's planning to do a "serious breakdown" in the president's polling.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said he was going to "break the president's strike" after the election time in November.
Boston Globe announced that the Massachusetts Democratic Party declared its future at the city hall in Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who was often harassed by President Donald Trump, urged himself to re-election in November against the country's GOP administration, Geoff Diehl, the leader of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he had been marked as a Trump opponent in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon at Holyoke is 36 with his electorate, which has been marked with city hall format since Trump's departure.
An actor asked him if there was any plan to reinstate himself as president.
Warren also said, "This is the right time for a woman to enter the Washington circle to restore our corrupt government, and that includes the time for women to sit on the top."
He's captured by the Sims shooter, LSU player.
On Saturday, the Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced that he was under arrest as a gunman until the death of Wade Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested at 11 a.m. at the ET press conference.
They filmed the shooting on Friday, where a man identified asked for help as seen in the recording.
In the morning, Sims, 20 years old, was shot and found dead near Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in his head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, through 247 sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend and Simpson fired a shot at him.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being in the scene, holding firearms, and shooting him toward Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a fight and put into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior player with six feet six inches tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, that's the Sims sook, has played in 32 games with 10 beginnings last summer and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 score in each match.
Grand Prix boy in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world title after the team acknowledged his victory over Sebastian Vettel
It all became clear when the Bottas Valteri was in front of Lewis Hamilton in the qualification shift on Saturday, which would bring the Mercedes team's command to play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start position and almost left Hamilton because he defended his position in the first two rounds and attracted Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel became the first to go into the pit and let Hamilton move into the bridge at the end of the crowd, something that should have been very determined.
Mercedes entered the pit one lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to move on after a few follow-up actions that showed the driver's presence of Ferrari left the part empty with the risk of survival after a double move to survive on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started starting in the grid line and was in the seventh position at the end of the first November at his 21st birthday.
He then led to a large part of the race because he held the ban shift to plan a quick settlement and took the Kimi Raikkonen position for the fourth position.
He finally got into the pit in the 44th lap, but he couldn't raise his step in the eight leaves because he finally took the fourth position.
It's a hard day because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man who let me.
Team has done a wonderful job to have one two," said Hamilton.
It's a very bad language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Diane Feinstein in a rally on Saturday through his village, he did not reject a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about sexual violence against the High Judge Brett Kavanaugh
Speaking on a line in West Virginia, the president did not directly present a statement made by Ford before the Senate's Committee of Predators, but instead commented on what was happening in the Senate that showed people who were "serious and unscrupulous and dishonest."
"Something can happen and the beautiful thing is happening for the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and mean and dishonest," he said.
"When you saw the cheerleaders and the crackers and then they said, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you burn it?
Remember the answer... did you fire the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't throw it away."
Okay, hold on a second.
Did we burn... no, we didn't burn it," he added, as a senator's impression.
Feinstein has sent a letter that drives charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and that was earlier in September - but Feinstein objected to the fact that it did not come from his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's accusation, I'm not throwing up his story," Feinstein's speech to the committee, told Hill.
"He asked me to hide it and I kept it as secret as his request."
But his opposition seems to be inconceivable by the president, who commented during a line on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, it's a very bad language of the body.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's the worst language I've ever seen."
Further his defense against the High Judge, who was charged with sexual harassment against three women, the president was impressed with the democratic opinion that he used charges for his own sake.
"They are determined to take over power in various ways.
You see the evil, the insatiable, they don't care who they're sick, who they have to walk to get power and surveillance," Mediaite reports on the president's speech.

Patrick Dwyer printed two goals for Giants when faced with Dundee
Dundee Stars was defeated on Friday at the Elite League when he fought Belfast Giants by winning a match with a score of 5-3 on Saturday.
Giant got two goals first after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the housekeeper together before Dwyer returned to the Giants.
Francois Bouchard compared his position to Dundee before two goals Lucas Lundvald Nielsen won their victory.
It's the third-year defeat of the Elit League that has been experienced by Adam Keefe, who has succeeded in pursuing survival and finally triumphs to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
That was the fourth meeting this summer between the two sides, with three Giants wins in the previous match.

During the thick opening period, Sullivan brought the housekeeper back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the anchor for the balance done by Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure of Giants' superiority at the time of the first hunt when the two night's goal went down at the end of the first period.
The housekeepers returned and Bouchard once again balanced their position with the goal of power play at the time at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give control to Dundee for the first time at the end of the second match and he ensures victory with his team in the middle of the fifth final period.
Giants, who have now suffered four defeats from their five matches, are in the camp to face Milton Keynes at their next match on Friday.
The air traffic controller then left to secure hundreds of passengers on the plane from the disaster
A driver passed an airship in Indonesia to escape as a hero after his death when he made sure a plane that brought hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died in the world, and many others have disappeared after a major earthquake swept through the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering tsunamis.
A severe drought continues to collapse the region and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But his colleagues fled for their safety, the 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agang refused to leave his post at a driving tower that crashed into Sis Al Jufri Mutiara Airport, Palu.
He chose to stand by to make sure that the 6321 Batik Air Flight was on the ground of the package, could safely land.
He then jumped out of the driver's tower and crossed when he felt the tower began to fall.
He died in a hospital.
The jury spoke to the Service Navigation Foundation of Indonesia, Johannes Siret, about his decision to save hundreds of lives, reports from the news of Australia’s ABC.
We prepared a helicopter from Balykpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost track this morning before the helicopter got to the Palu.
"We're all sorry to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities worried about the death of the victim could reach thousands of times after the National Disaster Relief Board had given access to the city of Dodgala, Sigi, and Boutong.
"Sacrifice assured will continue to increase because of the many victims that are still in ruins and many others that cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a national disaster management body.
The volume that reaches six meters has made the palu a rash that causes mass funerals on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carried supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance carries a body.
Clean water became rare.
Minimarkets everywhere in history"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's been a tragedy, but it might be getting worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Ready?" CNN report.
In the early years of this year, Indonesia was also hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian aircraft accident: Water Niugini reported a missing person after an aircraft crash
The air carrier operated a plane that crashed into the Pacific basin in Micronesia and reported that one person had disappeared, after being previously reported to 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Water Niugini presented a report on Saturday’s day, and the authorities were unable to identify a passenger.
The company said the company had cooperated with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The company does not respond quickly to the passengers ’ requests for more details, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats help rescue passengers along with other cruises, after the plane hit the water when trying to land at Chuuk Island.
On Friday, the officials announced that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The company reported six passengers to the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What has caused the accident and the sequence of events to take place completely remains to be seen.
The company and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed on the bridge around the runway.
Some witnesses feel that the plane is overpassing the runway.
U.S. citizen Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to get through the high - voltage door through the emergency door on that sinking plane.
He reported panic and screams, and he suffered a little headache.
The U.S. Navy says that fishermen who work close to the repaired prize also help rescue boats to transport people to the ground before a plane sinks into the interior about 30 metres (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates 111 people have died of the world in a PNG-registered accident for the last two decades but not one involving Water Niugini.
Analysis releases a woman's life-burning nightline
A request for detention on Saturday in a re-examination of a man who was accused of being burned alive against a Mississippi woman in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made a big line for the jury about how he used cell phone records to collect various moves that were made in charge of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from some cell phones that showed Tellis to be in one location with Chambers on the night of his death, compared to a previously accused statement, told Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that the cell phone was in one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was at the time with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked for a statement from Sanford.
Sanford followed the verdict on Saturday and he testified that he was not in the city on the day of the incident.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "a liar, because my truck was in Nashville."
The other inconsistency reported by Tellis was that he knew Chambers about two weeks until the death of the victim.
Cell phone records indicate they know each other in a week's time.
Rowlett reported that after the death of Chambers, Tellis sometimes deletes messages, calls, and contact the Chambers information from his phone.
"He removed the victims from his life," said Hale.
The survey was scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge announced that he hoped that the trial would be brought to the jury that day.
The High Breed: What spirit hip hop?
A group of hip hops want to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, who comes from Bristol, claims hip hop movement away from the origins of political messages and reduces social issues.
They want to go back to her base and make the hip hop spirit popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Commons have seen recent resurrections in the UK through some artists like Akala and Lowkey.
The other black guy?
NY guardian demands a couple because they attack after issuing a "racial" message
A New Yorker demanded a couple because he had been discriminated against after receiving a direct message from a mother who's complicated and said that she was "the other blacks."
The couple refused if they were considered racist, and they considered it more like "frequentness."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, showed concern when she realized that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black after she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"There's no way you're going to live the rest," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Anyway, instead of sending it to her husband, she even sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, saying that they had released a rapist, who was an African-American citizen, because he had done a bad job and he was more expectant of the Philippines, based on New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day’s work and then spent using Uber.
Now, Maurice demands that the couple provide compensation for the placement, and asks for compensation of about $350 a day for a period of six months, as a substitute for the job that he had to do at first, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do anything like that," he said to the Post on Sunday, and he added, "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple objected to the claim that they were rational, that the workers who were fired Maurice was a reasonable thing to do, that they were afraid they could not believe it after they were offended,
"My wife sent something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But can you let your children be treated by someone you've been through, even though it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
It's like wrapped up in a "confusion," said his wife's new two-months-old baby was born and in a "very difficult situation."
"You're going after someone like that?
It's not a good thing to do," investment banks added.
When the legal case is still under way, the public opinion has made a rapid threat to the couple in the social media, blaming them for their attitude and logic.
Paddington's public is worried that the reader will not be connected to the bear talking, the new paper covered.
His daughter Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after her book was accepted, explained in a letter: "It's hard to talk only without knowing the position she was in, to read it for the first time before it was published.
It's so funny to know how we know about the great success of Paddington."
Said his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspired by the writing of a child book with bear toys, who was very optimistic about the results of his rejected work, he added a re-year of publication that the 60-year-old felt "sweet" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father quite proudly with the end of his success.
"He's a man of enough rest, and he's not a proud man," he said.
"But because Paddington means so much to him, it's like you have a child who's got something: you're proud of them even though not all your efforts.
I think he's looking at Paddington's success like that.
Though it was the result of his creation and imagination, he always praised Paddington himself."
My daughter is in a state of death and I have to say good-bye to her through the phone.
At the time of his arrival, his daughter was immediately taken to Nice Louis Pasteur's hospital, but the doctors failed to rescue him.
"Ned made a call quietly to say it was very bad. That he was very likely not to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I got a call from Nad who said he would die in the generation two minutes ahead and he asked me to say good-bye to him.
And I did it, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors have been given to keep her heart beating slowly and slowly out and leave her body.
He died a few times during the processing process and everything felt dead.
I could just sit there and wait, understand all this has been covered up.
I can't shake, or yell or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold it all."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, at the moment of mourning over the loss of her daughter, the plane with the other passengers -- without realizing what had happened.
"No one knows," he said.
"My head is down and my eyes keep standing all the time.
It's so hard to explain, but when I was on that flight, I felt so much sympathy for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much she loves him."
Women who are mourning post a card to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones tried to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspiring messages and numbers that can be contacted to get support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, age 13 when he began to suffer depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with a loud smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They used to say that his smile was spreading the air."
But he stopped working before he died, like he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother found his brother after he killed himself.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm still worried if there's any side effects."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone out there that you can close up and talk, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and be quiet - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, his husband for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"Some days before Christmas we noticed there was a change in his behavior.
He was in the lowest point of Christmas--when the kids opened their gift he didn't look at them or anything."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to go through it, "That's what caused a breakdown in the family.
That separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh was uncertain when the FBI started his investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking -- an investigation that's limited in time, limited in its scope -- we might be able to bring some unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the committee "damaged" in the midst of the collapse of the council's decision-making.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their lack of faith is caused by time.
The legislators reside for five more weeks, on November 6th -- if, as expected, the Republic did so badly, they would be very weak in their ability to make the people they wanted to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators, beat them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him to meet his wife Ashley, the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will sit.
It's not clear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the president's representative, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korea 'njlok' vendors under Kim
The number of people from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-un ruled seven years ago, a member of the Korean Parliament of the United States.
Park Byeong-seug, referring data from the South Union's welfare data, said there were 1,127 years ago -- compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the border control between North Korea and Tingkok and the higher tariffs that people's snowflakes suffer is the key factor.
Pyongyang doesn't give a public comment.
Most Northers were finally offered the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through Tigkok, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarization Zone between the two Koreas.
Unhappily, the fugitives were treated as illegal migrants by refugees and often forced to return.
The relationship between the North and the South — which is technically still in the war — has increased dramatically in the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for a conversation that was geared towards a closed declination negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of the United States in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work together on a nuclear-free trip to Korea.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the underdevelopment since then.
"Without trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, we will not be able to drop our weapons on the one hand," Mr. Ri said in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of "histories," said he did not fit to serve at the Supreme Court
The leader of the opposition Nancy Pelosi accused the Supreme Court of being "histories" and said he didn't fit the temper to serve at the Supreme Court.
Policio made that comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a Chinese woman did that, they would say "histories," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Legal Chamber on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally protested that he had committed sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were both young.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and having trouble speaking when discussing his family and his years in high school.
He also misjudged the Democrats in the committee, saying the charges against him were "unreasonable and coordinated murder" organized by the liberals who were angry because Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's witness proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because he was usually against the Democrats.
"I think he's reclassifying himself with those statements and with his attitude towards Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Philosophy objected if he tried to claim that he had agreed, and if the Democrats had received more voice at the National Court of Justice.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't really tell Congress or the FBI, then he doesn't fit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," said Pelosio.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at the D.C. High Court.
Policio added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the potential of Kavanaugh's decision on Health Services Laws or Roe v. Wade, because he was regarded as a conservative sense of justice.
In the task force, Kavanaugh avoids the question of whether he will distort certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for someone who's hysterical and ordinary to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great?'
And the woman needs to handle it.
It's an ethical crack, anger for months and years, and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry: Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"It's not strange to me, what do you think?"
He continued, "I am very much helped by an executive in a place that says that he also wept when he's angry, but develops a technique that means that he's angry and starts to cry, he'll say to the person who talks to him, "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he keeps going.
And I think it's brilliant."
The water was poured out as a way out of some anger because it was basically understood.
One of my most powerful memories of the early work, in the office dominated by a man, when I cried with unexpressed anger, was my stomach burned by an older woman - a cold manager who was always a little frightened - who pushed me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they're successful."
Patricia Schroeder, a member of the Colorado Congress, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage collision on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, he understood that there was no reason for himself not to act as president.
"It's not a mature decision," she told me while laughing 30 years later.
"After there are seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called it "The Queen of Snow and Seven Kurcaci."
Because he's late in the campaign, he's left behind in a fund-raiser, and so he swears he won't follow the election unless he's able to collect $2 million.
It's a fight that ends with a defeat.
He found that some of his supporters gave $1,000 to the man only gave him $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he asked.
When he competed, he announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overpowered by emotions - thank you to the people who supported him, frustration with a system that made the money drop so difficult and to draw the electorate from the delegation, and anger against sexism - making it difficult to talk.
"You might think I'm too nervous," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacts to him.

How the U.S. sales competition might be good for Beijing
The opening of US-Tigkok's trade competition so exacerbated, and when his fight is still far from the word of use, the division between the two countries may only be a favor for Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, launched this year's first warning by taxing Tigkok's key export goods including solar, steel and aluminium.
A very significant contribution was made this week with a new tariff affecting the value of $200 billion (£150 billion), with effective taxing half of all goods entering the United States through Tigkok.
Beijing has paid back every time, recently reduced tariffs to five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
Tigkok has requested to match the United States alone, and the second largest economy in the world will not change in the near future.
Calling Washington to retreat means to follow the wishes, but publicly defeating the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President Tiongkok.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, U.S. trade pressure can support Tingkok in a positive way in the long term by reducing the tension between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing can make an economic movement in both countries even more dangerous than previously known," said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focused on Asia in the Center for New American Security, an expert bank.
Syria 'prepared' for the refugee incident, according to Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria said that they were ready for a voluntary refugee break and offered help to rebuild a country that had been destroyed by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the U.S. General Mayor, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in his country improved.
"Today, the situation in the field is more stable and securely blessed for progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to bring it back again.
All the conditions now exist because they return voluntarily to the country that they should leave because of terrorism and the broad economic decision that makes their lives a daily life and their eyes clear as a target.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian citizens have fled its country since the war began in 2011.
The other six million people still living in that country needed humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild a ruined country.
But he stressed that they would not receive help or conditional assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
