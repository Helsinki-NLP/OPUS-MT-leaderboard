I plan to skip lunch.
I'm planning to visit Tom in Boston next weekend.
I want dogs more than cats.
I prefer goat cheese from cow.
I'm starting the egg from the undergarment.
I prefer the black one.
I'd rather sit down.
I'd rather walk alone.
I must sound funny.
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
I punched his box in his jaw.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
I drew the word "Alis" to highlight it.
I proposed it.
I put three coffees of fake sugar in your tea.
I opened my tent.
I gave up smoking the curses.
I quit.
I'm raising goods.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like your hair.
I really like it.
I love your website so much.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mother's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I want to learn French a lot.
It would really be nice to shut up.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember how I met the queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried one.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said he might turn around.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Anybody in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is there something missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I saw him right now.
I saw how to play cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister leave the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the hamster in the mine.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom and Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is he far away from Boston?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Are you caloric compacts?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are they all busy?
Are they all happy?
Is everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
He's breathing?
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
I got right on my head.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should be sorry for them.
I need to take her home.
I need to pack up.
I need to get dressed.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should've asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more cultural.
I should have checked.
I should have done that yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have refused.
I showed my room.
Is he cold outside?
Is it over?
Is it far from here?
Is Daddy really too slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I've glued his locker.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I'm sleeping standing.
I slept like a curse.
I slept in the barn.
I slept on a bus.
I cut the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholics?
I laughed.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible for Tom to do this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this great?
I kind of like it.
I spent the whole day cleaning up snow.
Is she a cab driver?
Is she pregnant or is she just fat?
Is she really that pretty?
Is that your mother?
I'm staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I've done something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
That means "yes" or "no"?
Is there a word at all?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that Sarkam?
Is that enough?
Is she Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So there's Tom?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you came?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is it paid for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it a diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this exactly English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is it your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this place free?
Was that all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still don't believe Tom left.
Somehow, I still don't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom aware?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Does Tom die of cancer?
Is Tom having fun?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Are you upset by Tom?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
You talk to Tom?
Is Tom there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying Tom's attention.
I burned the kibrite in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
I suddenly felt old.
I'm suffering from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on the demand to get out of this cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm starving for you.
I suggest you send someone outside to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's the way I doubted it.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't get caught up with you if I burned you if you were the last bucket of water.
I'm sweating every day.
Is your freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I use the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about what items to get.
That whole thing makes sense.
It looks pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So it wasn't.
It's not possible!
You're up for now.
It seemed a lot more than I expected.
Never, but never really, it couldn't happen here.
There's no way he was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
I didn't care.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get so bad.
That disappoints him.
It'd look good.
I don't mind.
It won't get better.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; in any case you have to.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
It doesn't sound like they know what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I'm teaching Chinese.
I teach him English.
It's my time.
That gave me an idea.
I have something to do with it.
It had to be done.
It's got to be created from somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too soon.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's cold.
It's not about luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has a sentimental value.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I think of him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm real.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see what he's like.
I think I love you.
I think I've made myself quite clear.
I think I'm writing pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible for me to pee.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French very well.
I think it's risky without any help.
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it's time you left now.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I'm wrong.
I think I might be able to help her.
I think he's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's crazy.
I think it's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's unconscious.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom was brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's beautiful.
I think Tom is cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's evil.
I think Tom's fine.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's tiny.
I think Tom's a sepide.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's under siege.
I think Tom's being sued.
I think Tom's sensitive.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's going.
I think we can catch him.
I think we better not drink water.
We better not get out of this storm.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to the solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've eaten enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should pick her.
I think you should do this alone.
I think you can help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you spend too much time with Tom.
I think you should go out on your own with this.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought there were bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask for his help.
I thought I'd ask for their help.
I thought I lost all the money, but it seems I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought it was causing me.
I thought you already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom was retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was coming from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
So we didn't agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I was thinking about visiting the museum together.
I think you're gonna have a goose job.
So you didn't want the reward?
I thought you found another one.
I thought you lost your handcuff.
So you don't hate him?
I thought you were tired.
I thought you might be able to help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you were only dating girls who were lower than you.
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
So you didn't say you knew how to swim?
So you didn't say you wanted to go with us?
I thought you were playing chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
It hurts so much here.
Mary's nervous when Tom leaves the hat out of the closet up.
It's a multi-phase process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
His first day at school.
I can't answer the question.
There's no way I can finish my job in one day.
It's less wet than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying.
There's no point in it.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get into our head that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer than yesterday.
It's worth quoting a well-known passage of his essay.
It's on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It's kind of wrong for me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It'll be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be worth it.
It looked terrible.
It looked funny.
Looks like you're right.
It looks very delicious.
It looks different.
It seems familiar to me.
It looks like an egg.
Looks like I drank too much last night, my head's shaking, and I'm really tired.
Looks like these two are back together.
Looks like these two were calming down.
Looks like we're gonna have a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's what I got close to Tom.
You missed me.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It might sound like a proposal, but it was an order.
Maybe he'll come back tonight.
Maybe it's weird.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It might rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It must be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me that time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I can't.
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen years old.
I told you this was gonna get rough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I fell apart.
I got back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I fully understand.
Probably won't be worth waiting for.
He was back two days ago.
He's been having a lot of trouble.
I tried to explain it to him, but I don't.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to make him come.
I tried to make them stop.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
I'm sincerely sorry for that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to dry up.
He's getting ready to roll.
It's a classic.
It was a real disaster!
It is recommended that you check for adverse effects if you drink alcohol while taking the medicine you have been prescribed.
It's a children's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
We're done.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
It's almost over.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's about to go.
Epten's fun.
It's seven o'clock.
It's 11 o'clock.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's weird that you survived.
It's my honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
That's a fake sign.
It's a risk plan.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
It's coming up fast.
It's just a job.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They broke it.
It's just that Makki made it to me.
He's been back for a week, up-down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely hot.
It's best you don't talk that much.
You better be alone.
It is better to be optimistic than to be pessimistic and right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one.
It's time to close.
He's walking here.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
It's dark here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to end up in prison than to run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
I guess I misjudged him.
It looks like her style.
I think it's the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's bad to puke.
It's ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
She's dressed.
It's darker.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It'll be beastly.
It's gonna be cooler.
It'll happen soon.
I'm glad to see you all again.
That's good training.
It's okay.
It's improved.
It's very fun.
It happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's hot in here in hell.
That should be possible.
It shouldn't take a long time for this.
I don't care what you think of Tom.
It's impossible for him to quit smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in great shape.
It's in the basement.
I'm just waiting.
It's just a question.
It's just invented.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of skin.
I'll decide, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to carry such gifts.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's loud in here.
It's not your job!
It's not a secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not back.
That's not exactly what happened.
It won't be easy to do that without much help.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's nothing terrible.
It's not just a guess.
It's not usually a pen.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not that we're doing something.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not yet spring.
Don't surprise me.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It doesn't depend on you.
It doesn't happen very often to buy a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a print error.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
That sounds pretty strong.
Sounds very good.
It's our job to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still there.
Probably still available.
It's double.
It's actually very common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
It's only possible that Tom wouldn't help us at all.
It's simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's a real damage.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's a law!
It's so obvious that we don't need any evidence.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark outside.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
It's still not worth it.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's strange how people in the tropical areas eat frozen food like kari.
It's stuck.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best thing I've ever tasted.
It's a spider casino.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them on a level-by-level basis.
Epten is strong.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
It's not going to hold this heat.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom right now.
It's very relaxed.
It's very simple to understand.
It's hot in here.
I don't care.
There's a wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
The water only needs three minutes to close.
It's been going on all night.
It took a lot more than I thought it would.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
It turns out you're an unexpected beauty.
I turned the fan on and I directed him to the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned the TV off.
I turned him down, Tom.
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was midnight.
This was an Arena day.
It was a great show.
That was all my idea.
It was okay here.
It was so easy.
That was an amazing night.
It was a sit-down.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was a debt I spent the night with a smart, spiritual and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
That was a wonderful experience.
It was a hard test.
It was a hot night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a great day.
It was a wonderful night.
Such conduct was childish on his part.
It was a shame.
It was working.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
It was fun yesterday.
It was nightingale.
It was freezing.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was loving of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy to admit that I was wrong.
It wasn't easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
The pain in dogs is proved to be higher than the pain in cats.
It was great.
It was pretty funny.
Epten was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
She was breathing a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the locker.
It was Tom.
It was too little.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was inconceivable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very supple in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was better.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It won't be okay.
It won't be enough.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
There's nothing going to cost you to fix it.
They won't help lies.
It won't help you.
Good work.
It would be very normal for you to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I can explain everything.
I need you.
I've been looking after you before.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I already wrote everything I needed to write.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
I've always been helped.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I've got the cake.
I burned their cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little overwhelmed with another.
I turned the whole city looking for Dom.
It was a lot worse for me.
They betrayed me.
I've been informed.

We've been talking for up to two hours.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
We tried to get them to come.
We tried to get them to tell us.
We tried to hide it.
We understand that.

Oh, well, that's great.
Wow!
Write your birth date.
Write to Tom.
If so, it'll be better... when the worm gives birth to grapes.
Yeah, bring me some cheese.
Yeah, anyway.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
Yes, my angel.
Yeah, and?
Yeah, well?
Yesterday, I prepared a cake with wheat.
I came here yesterday.
It was hot yesterday, but today it's more sustainable.
Yoga comes from India.

You always forget.
You always get me wrong.
You always leave your point dirty.
You and I are gonna fly the same plane.
You don't seem to know how it hurts to kiss you alone.
You cook well.
You're beautiful.
At the same time, you are both hard and easy, and pleasant and bitter; I can't live with or without you.
You're drunk!
You're my friends.
You're my luck.
You're my pride and joy.
You're not a Japanese.

You can ask Tom.
You can avoid such problems if you have these wise advice.
She can be trusted.
You can wrap me around, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never catch my mind.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
You can count on us.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
Now you must leave, sir.

You can't control me, Tom.
You can't deny it.
You can't deny it.
You can't do what you want.
You can't fire her.
You can't fire him.
Now you can't help us.

You're quick to get the data.
You're cooking a peanut.
You may be wrong.
You could've refused.
You'd be a great mother.
Ask them first.
To find them.
You better go help him.
You better go.
You better let me do that.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
You deserve better.
You're gonna do the same thing in my place.
You've done the wrong thing.
You've done your job well.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about it, right?
You already did that.
He did all he could.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't even like fish.
You're sick, aren't you?
Don't you have a random key?
You don't have any more time.
You don't have to be abnormal to work here.
My dick you know.
You don't know anything.

You don't have to be present for this.
You don't have to go.
You don't have to panic.
You don't have to wear anything sour.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't understand business.
You don't want to do something that will remind them that you're actually not big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You don't work here.
You're driving me crazy.
You forgot your backpack!
You scared Tom.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
You have the right to a phone call.
You go get Tom and get back.

I respect you.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
You didn't see that, did you?
You haven't solved the problem, have you?
You have a really good manuscript.
Your hands are soft.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a present.
You have to go home.
You have to help him.
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
You have to resign.
You have to sit down.

You have very beautiful lips.
You've got a lot of eyebrows.
You've heard exactly.
Just get back from vacation.

You almost missed Tom.
You don't get involved in this.
Kids, you're here to stay.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you do.
You know me better.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're learning fast.
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
You left me in despair.
You let Tom escape.
You love your life, don't you?
You'll be all right.
You're going to be confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You'll be famous in time.
You'll feel better.

You'll have to learn more about next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You'll need a map to travel by bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.

You look pretty bad.
You look really good.
What's wrong?
You look like you're up to it.
You look very handsome, Tom.
You earned something.

You're distracting me.
Maybe you'll be needed.
You can go anywhere.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be bad to slow down.
You met my sister, right?
Maybe you can help them.

One is life.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth every meal.
You should go to the dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You pay me very well.
You chose well.
You probably think I'm a traitor.
It's gone red.
He was running as fast as he could.
You're burning the car.
You're burning the car.
Your complaints upset me.
Your transgressions have profaned the graves of your ancestors.
Your demands are unreasonable.
Your desserts are sticky, but we're small.
You're ready to cry.
You're absolutely right.
You're a real human being.
You're acting weird.
You're a brute.
You're a fraud.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a loving man.
You're all cowards.
You're all the same.

You're not that young anymore.
You're not a freak.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You won't find me.
You won't find them.
You won't find us.
You're under her level.
You're below his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that terrible.
You don't suggest we give Tom all the money, do you?
You're not that old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.

You're lying, Tom.
You know, you look weird.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You're too tight when you're shaking.
Why don't you go to a doctor?
Your house is very beautiful.
It's good to remember you.
Your moon is coming back.
Your mother put your cologne in the top drawer.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
Your path is hard.
Your doctorate must be written in English.

Your propaganda is not interesting.
Your faith is bad.
Your role here is so important.
Your cop's full of books.
There's yours.
Your sister's asleep.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
All your stuff is here.
Your wishes are my command.
Your patent is unlocked.
That's what you said an hour ago.
You told me to call anytime.
You said we'd never catch her.
You said you'd help.
You said you'd write me a message at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
Apparently you already know the answer.
You look like he's studying you.
Looks like you've got an infection.
Apparently it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You need to ask them for help.
You should ask Tom.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Be careful not to overdo it.
You should be happy for them.

You sound like you're relieved.
You sound very safe.
You took off your ankle.
You're beautiful.
You really talk a lot.
You talk too much about Boston.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
Traitor!
You two are very cute together.
You used to be so fun.
He used to love Boston.
You're back.
They drank you.
You've had a traffic ride, but you're gonna be fine.
You missed us.
It was for our great benefit.
You're right from the beginning.
You made white again!
You bought Mary something.
You hit me.
You beat them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.
She's out of her mind!
You've got a rash.
You're under enough care.
You got me wrong.
I promise.
You got it now, don't you?
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
You're ruining Tom.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been delaying this for too long.
You saw what I could do.
You were amazing.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
He was lucky to have survived the attack.
You're wrong.
It's not that you were wrong.
He was right, Tom.
He was driving fast.
He was great.
You're not asleep all night, are you?
He was very brave.
She wasn't right about the picture.
You'll do as I command you.
You'll find your toys and books.
You won't need that.
You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna win.
You're too worried about him.
You wouldn't want to be late.
Yeah, I'm mad.
