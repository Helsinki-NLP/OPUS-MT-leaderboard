White pedone at f3, black pedone at e6, white pedone at g4, black pedone at h4 - black pecko matte! This is a jokely indicated in the chess circles as a "match of shock".
White: Tower in a1, pawn in b6, king in c8. Black: pawns in a7 and b7, king in a8, alpha in b8. White puts the opponent in zugzwang by playing the tower in a6, after the Nero has only two options: take the tower in a6 or move its alpha in any other sketch on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the White makes progress on its pedestrian from b6 to b7 and gives poor matte. In the second situation, the Tower takes the black pawn in a7, with the same result.
