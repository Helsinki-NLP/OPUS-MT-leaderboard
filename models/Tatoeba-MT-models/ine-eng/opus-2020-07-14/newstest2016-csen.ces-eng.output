At the emergency call, the professor admitted he shot his girlfriend.
During a call on the emergency line with a trembling voice Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he shot his girlfriend and it's necessary to come home to them.
Lamb presided that his "sweet dog" was home alive and probably upset, and that contact with the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten message on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," stood in a letter signed by Lamb by the authorities.
There was no doubt that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to the school campus, where the police believe he shot the favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at his office door.
Police chief at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university employees heard the shooting at 10:18 in the morning.
Lamb made a fateful phone call on the emergency line shortly after.
Finally another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school was shot, the students and the faculty were forced to hide behind the closed door, and the authorities were still trying to record what Lamb's motivation was.
Details published by investigators on the part of the state and students and employees who knew him together created a picture of a talented, but probably a problem teacher.
The students confirmed that they were pleased with his lesson.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no record in the criminal record or violent history.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, in thanking "big people", with which he shared his academic life.
Both were taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, along with the next 17th members of the Faculty, and many students attended courses at both.
At the same time, there has been inclineation in the case of problems.
A student who raised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed excited and upset, "if there was nothing wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, pointed out that Lamb told him that he was suffering from stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had already asked Delta State University to free for health reasons when he said he had a problem.
And this year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes regarding the recruitment of university employees meant that the doctorate on which Lamb worked hard would not assign him an automatic functional period to become an assistant professor.
The president of William LaForge's university said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamba must have suffered something."
Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After he left campus, the police caught his mark when he crossed the border of Arkansas State back to Mississippi.
Before he could have been arrested, Lamb killed himself with the only gun at home, about a mile from his parents at Greenville Prefecture in Mississippi, confirmed Washington State Coroner, Methel Johnson.
The car left the launches on the street.
It wasn't clear right away why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb started working at a university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which is about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and education hours.
In the spring, he got a doctorate in education.
One of Lamba's long friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston stated that she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through common friends.
She was with her friends at high school, and he was the great elder boy who taught her to play guitar for several years.
It was quite a heart attack at the time.
The heart of all the girls died as soon as he found out," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson Prefecture.
Lamb and Prentiss were supposed to be dating for a while.
During the emergency call Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house next to the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was okay.
Former Prentiss' husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they split 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely disappointed," said O'Steen about her daughter.
She was the best friend of her mother's.
He said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he knew Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when he and Abigail went out to the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and an occasional entertainment coordinator in The Julep Room, a well-lit bar near Gautier, said that the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss on the night of September 5th, the path Lamb reached the guitar and harmony for an countless crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We were flattering and filming each other for jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a dead professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, English teacher at school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of a boy student club and the government of students.
In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including members of the faculty, employees, students and members of the community, took part in a commemorative event with candles.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and Brother Jeff Schnitt also attended the Watch during which the University Congregation sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, the school began again.
"We're trying to get our students back," says LaForge.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was adjusted to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a call on the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called his wife Prentiss, there is no evidence that they were really committed.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us claims that they will not pick as many seasonal workers as last year, but the producer of children's toys and products claims to give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also stated that it was planning to hire about 40,000 employees at work in shops and distribution centres throughout the country, which was reduced by 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company announces that it will start with the recruitment of the refugees this month, and the employee will be picking up during October until December.
While holidays alone are months away, the shopping holiday season is getting closer and companies are preparing to receive temporary assistance in shops and sales, for dispatch and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'Rande' with Princess Diana
The premiere "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the arrival of the royal family, when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I found that the princess Diana would sit there," said in the trailer for the coming document, "Back in time."
The movie starts and I'm beginning to think that I'm on the verge of something that could be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in time," is a document on "Return to the Future," which presents talks with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The "Back to the Future" premiere was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really for me the best travel document ever filmed."
"Back in time" will be available on the VOD, DVD and in selected movies in October.
The chief of the United Nations says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of nearly five years of conflict and more weapons only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The chief of the United Nations called again urgently on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to join and support an inclusive political settlement.
Ban said at the mid-term press conference that he is planning to meet with the ministers of the five permanent councils of the countries - the USA, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the end of this month's ministerial meeting to discuss the situation in Syria.
He said policing that the divisions in the Council and between Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation unresolved."
The Ban called on the five remaining members to show solidarity and unity, which they showed in reaching the Iranian nuclear agreement in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 election numbers showing Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to label him as a person who often changes opinions.
The others over their hands as over undeclared jokes.
And some are preparing for the implosion.
But if some Republicans are trying to get Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they will not do it (now).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of a two-digit number, and some people start asking seriously what it means for the nomination of this magnet from the property area.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is probably winning a Republican nomination.
The experts point out that during this period of 2011 Rick Perry’s lead to Herman Cain’s resignation did not win the only position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he could be in general elections.
But external groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bushe and the Economic Conservative Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to endure and start spending their dollars on the table with a view to defeating him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that indicate that the actual magnet is not just a motion phase:
The benefit assessment of the trumpet was 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's vote showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real magnet.
In mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
The scratches three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion on him.
And these numbers are being kept in the initial stages.
Following the vote of the University of Quinnipiac, which took place last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion on Trump.
Two thirds of GOP's wishes would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of Republicans reported that they would be either "congratulation" or "satisfaction" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 admitted that they would be "burned" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates exactly the same level of excitement as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "invented" against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Another closest to the level of excitement?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republican volunteers claim that they would be "satisfied" or "dissolved" if they were to favor Jeb Bush as a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his insurgentness and insults, 52 per cent of the Republic's wishes are totally inclined to think that the real magnet has the right temperature for the post of president, according to Monday's vote ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held in the Senate club of the state of Iowa, which is the first in the whole country, where 52 percent of Republicans think it has the personality of the commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent feel that he has no personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independents say that his temper does not belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to this idea.
When she wears her student hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question of who most likely wins the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's a change from late July when four of the 10 people put their money on Jeba Bush.
Full publication: The GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
During the last cycle, 4 of 10 Republicans selected Rick Perry as the candidate for the 28% candidacy for any of Mitt Romney's nominations.
However, it is shown that a certain number of GOP fans see the Trump campaign as credible.
Even though the Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump will defeat almost everyone.
Some students stress that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is widely distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But the study of Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct battle between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always receive majority support.
Lead over Carly Fiorin by 13 points, Mark Rubem by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jebe Bushem by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christem by 33 points at each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would lead over a merchant with a wide 19 points in a hypothetical match against one another.
The vast majority of the climbers, Donald Trump, claim they have already made their views.
The new CBS/NYT Tuesday survey shows that only half of the Tromp supporters claim that they will no longer change their opinion.
Clearly, many things can change, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46% say they're leaving the back door open to change between the candidates.
However, Trump's current strongest opponent is his external partner neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violents" in his campaign announcement, immigration is still being held as the main and central theme of the 2016 conversation.
Some are afraid that Trump's buoyancy is driving key Spanish voters away from the Republican side and the damage to rebranding efforts.
But according to a new ABC/Post public survey, six of the 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that while the topic of immigration remains in the shadow of reflectors, Donald Trump will remain as well.
Frustration from the government is reaching new maximums.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive almost half of the support from the Republican volunteers, and above all because of their status as outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post vote say they prefer political outsiders than anyone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The vote of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated Republicans in Congress, 54 per cent were "unsatisfied" and 21 per cent were "sufferingly angry."
Snow has supported a greater share of the state's carbon charges.
Czech Republic gets over 400 million.
The first reading was supported by the government's new top law, which regulates the amount of the amount of the charges from the surface of the coal levy from the mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised the MPs that they would also receive money from both the government and the budgets of the municipalities.
The proposal was criticised by the opposition Members who are afraid that the supply companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as much as they do today, because they will pay higher charges directly to the State budget.In the first reading, the November supported the government's new top law, which means that the State should receive more of the revenue from the supply of coal from the supply companies.
The country's share increases by 67 per cent, while the population's share decreases from today's 75 per cent to 33 per cent.
The proposal also changes the method of calculating the compensation for the losses incurred by companies.
The change in interest rates for the interest of the farmers is to contribute to the public savings of 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
According to the government, the budget revenue should have a neutral impact because the fee should be higher.
In the year preceding, the municipalities received about 450 million crowns and the state budget of 150 million crowns.
In the coal industry, there were about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns in the state.
Novela is also calculated by increasing the yield from the area of production with a permitted weight of 1000 crowns per hectare per year.
The admission of these buildings shall continue to be to the full extent of the municipalities.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the MPs that this resulted in a total of 14 million to 100 million crowns per year.
The amount of the levy will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The refund shall be re-calculated as a component of the quantity of the exported malt and the rate for each species of malt.
According to the government, the change is due, inter alia, to a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, the ODS Ambassador Marek Benda warned that the establishment of a fee under the Government Regulation should not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mádka, it is not taxable in this case because the state is paying for a state-owned disorder.
Fees shall be granted only to the countries whose territories are concerned.
In the case of deep pressure, coal will receive three quarters of the city's money and a quarter of the state.
The same will be true in the case of the demand for radioactive mines.
The part of the money that stands on the charges of the charge will be specifically linked.
For example, 28 per cent will have to go to repair damage to the supply or to provide the Banyan rescue service.
The proposal was criticised by the opposition MPs, who claimed, in particular, that they would harm the villages affected by the burden and the countries.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostov) warned that the supply companies would no longer want to sponsor the locals as they have so far, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kádner (Usvit) elected in the Ústek region.
Before the rise of unemployment in Mostecka, the KSČM MEP warned Han Aulicka.
Kádner and Auliká failed to propose to deny the novel, Kučera wanted the law to return the government to work.
The explanatory report states that, according to the companies concerned, the increase in fees does not lead to carbon prices, as prices are more than 90 per cent long-term leased.
The main consumers, such as power plants or heat plants, should therefore not feel a rise in prices.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that the supply organisations will make up for the increase in remuneration to compensate for the reduction of their operating costs, which would, above all, mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in wages from employment is profitable.
According to the report to the new Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is essential that Members know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and the government's decision on the limits of coal.
If the coal is too limited, then it will have consequences for the state and the country, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Youth that the decision to break the limit below the Czechoslovakian army should fall until 2020.
The thresholds below the ČSA should be broken for social, national and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Happy to bring the Czechs as a unit, setting the weather.
All four common tennis players will appear during the quarter-end of Davis’s bar at the table in India, and this time they will probably also get caught up in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Vrátil plans that due to difficult conditions, the burden will be spread throughout the quartet.
In Dillí, hot and high air humidity is under way, so there are challenges that can be extended to up to five sets.
We have to take it down.
I'd like to expand it by weather.
And according to what it would look like, he said back at today's Czech election exercise in the center of Radje Kumár Khanny.
With one team and the world's four-hundred Jiřím Weselim he counts for Friday and Sunday two.
In the position of the two are likely to flow through Lukas Rosol and Radek Štěpánek.
I'd like to get involved with almost everyone.
I've got it in my head, but I'm not gonna say it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech assembly should be the participation of Štěpankov in the 4th Saturday.
It's just a question of who's going to be next to an experienced delicacy who has a cup in Davis's fourth balance sheet at 18:4.
It's probably not going to be fun.
They're left with Rosal, or Adam Pavlásque.
"I really don't know who and what it's gonna look like," he said.
It shall be decided by two developments.
The Variant may be Pavlásek, surprised with joy in the 1st round by winning in the fat over Australia.
"He's worthy of the fat," said Vrvatil.
I've had it against Australia, and if I'm playing, I'd like to perform the same performance I've shown there since the second set.
"I love the experience, and I would like to bring a point," said Paul.
The home is placed in two Yuki Bhambri's (125th in the ATP label), which won the Challenger in Shanghai last week, where he defeated the third and fourth hundred players.
Two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They're both challengers and our ATP Tour experience, but we've been convinced many times that the tables don't decide on Davis's cup.
"It's a momentary form, weather," said Vrvatil.
The Friday opening twos will begin at 6:30 SELCH and can be pulled over due to weather.
It's supposed to have a shower and the yard isn't under the roof.
However, it may be possible to play for artificial lighting.
They've already burned it and it's got some two thousand luxurys, which is enough.
"It should be recorded under the light," said Natratil.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut in PMQ is very eagerly expected
New manager Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and he will first have to work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, while his performance will probably be carefully examined by the media and the MPs.
In a weekly statement, he asked for "less theaters and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip several sessions that he would leave with his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour Leader remained silent during the singing of the national Hymna in service on Tuesday to the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the British battle met with criticism from a number of conservative Members and was the focus of several stories on the title pages of the news.
Mr. Corby's decision not to sing national hymns drew attention
Mr. Corby's speech said he would "stand in a respectful silence" and recognizes "the heroship of the royal flight in the battle of Britain."
However, a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, announced to BBC Two's Newsnight that he would recommend to the Labour leader the national hymna to sing "without regard" to his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve at the top of Mr Corby's team, quoted differences in economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties initially supported him as leader.
The BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "organized" after the appointment of Mr Corbyn through his position in the European Union and the government's limit of doses.
Mr Corbil pointed out at the TUC conference that the Working Party had tabled amended proposals to remove the full thought of the dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, shadow worker and income secretary, stated that the party "very clearly" opposed government plans to reduce the limit of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Daily Party to whom David Cameron has been leading in the last decade of his election as the leader of the Conservatives.
The head of the working party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has ideas "from the bottom" on questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
The MP Islington North claims that PMQ is too confrontational and that it will be held both "responsibilities," as well as business, and instead promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, a shadow business secretary, will represent him at PMQ when he is not involved — such as when Mr. Cameron leaves abroad.
He also left behind the thought that he would allow other colleagues to come out from time to time because he heard that he was still discussing the whole matter with John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became the leader in 2005, he said he wanted to get rid of the "Punch and Judy" policy, which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later he admitted he failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer in the decision of the leaders, their management of the registry and their position among the other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become caricature and need a long-term reform.
"Focension in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
The Johannesburg Centre is a difficult place for homeless people.
But one group of former street children found a way to learn and make a living.
"I was drawn in Johannesburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighbors and make money like that.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

Libra climbs while wage growth in the United Kingdom accelerates
Libra jumped the following data and showed the rise in British forest growth, while FTSE 100 was led up to the offer of SABMiller.
Between May and June the GB profits including bonuses rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
It was the fastest since 2009 and it seemed as if the estimates were approaching when the rates would rise.
Sterling stood more than 1% against the dollar at $1.5505 and was 0.84% above the euro at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional market action and jumped 20% after he got a near offer from his rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine two world's largest breweries, and bring closer brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry stock was 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from the Richemont rival group.
The latest sales results of Richemont are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, began to rise again.
The shares in Glencore went up 5% after the demand giant said they went up to $2.5bn using shared placement as part of the debt reduction strategy.

JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sports company announced 83% jumps in half a year in profits before tax £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could damage the expansion
Executive President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that the higher minimum wage for employees in the UK could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would exceed the higher wage costs in his company, they say.
The costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, adding, which could mean less new jobs.
Prohibitors of Prague's apartments are riding.
Controversy building's got a foothold.
The investor Prague Projecti e Investmentmente considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will be appealed against.
Against the building, which is to be created in close proximity to the Anješka monastery in the center of Prague, there were protests before the Prague office of 1 hundred people, and five.
The Magistrate found in the decision that there had been a violation of the construction law because not all of the jurisdictions of the territorial decision were respected.
"The above-mentioned territorial decision does not include certain circumstances, such as the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, sufficiently clear and comprehensible the form of the building, the definition of the area affected by the impact of the building," its decision states.
It also considers that some of the grounds for the decision were issued to the documents originally discussed, but changed.
For example, it is the opinion of environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to arise on the ground National Gallery, but the investor has no valid consent.
It follows from the written material that, however, the owner of the land has only submitted agreement with the project documentation for land management, not with the location of the building on his land, the building order committee writes.
According to Francesca Augusta Razetta of the investment firm, the building order committee did not take into account the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the period for the initiation of the review had already expired.
Anyway, it's a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventy years, we have followed all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto stated in the press report.
The project, which people, because of the supposedly proposed color of the facades, call for a strong emotion in Prague.
In the center of the city, hundreds of people met in the past in protest against the building.
The association and the residents of the nearby homes suggest that some permits were issued years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticise the incompatibility of the building for the historic centre of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Anješka monastery.
The house was designed by the architect Zdeněk Franek, the project changed several times.
The original format of the 2008 project, which was calculated with the extended facade, was rejected on the basis of the opinion of the Ministry of Culture of the National Monuments Institute (NPU) and cancelled in 2010.
The new project of Prague Projecti e Investmenti with face-to-face windows was approved by NPÚ and masterminds and building permits were issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the claims of the opponents, that he never counted with the façade in pink, which gave the project a nickname after pink sugar.
The Czech politician tied the migrants up.
The Hungarians put him in the base with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On his way, he took three Syrian refugees with his crew to the car, who were about half a mile away.
At that time, according to him, it was not yet punishable in Hungary, he claimed to be the People's Newsman.
We knew the lawkeepers were not doing such a thing.
But when the police stopped us, we were arrested to our surprise and transferred to the investigation chain in Szeged, he wrote a letter.
In the end, he spent nine hours in politics.
The cops were doing the right thing, but they were communicating because they didn't have too good English.
However, he felt that the prison was sad.
For example, in our target of dimensions about three times four meters, 15 refugees from Syria were weighed.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were already locked up the other day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would go on with them, Berg said.

Metcash launches a campaign to fight Aldi's invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA businesses from Aldi's efforts in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches a campaign to fight Aldi's invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 shops in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and create an IGA brand through marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are added with brands such as the Simmo's ice cream cleaner based on Dunsborough offering IGA tastings and the owners of stores are selling cheap tickets to local customers on the Australian football league.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when food, alcohol and hardware vendors celebrate their annual investment strategy day.
In fact, there is a lot of it, because South and West Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA business steps and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Customers in South and West Australia are notorious provincials and IGA stores have a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 per cent in Eastern States.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will attract 5% of the food market in these two countries over 12 months after the opening of the first shops that took over the markets from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week in his report analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that retail IGA could lose USD 360 million on annual sales and Metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This provision is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in southern Australia and 30 in the west during the next year and generate sales of USD 500 and 600 million on individual markets.
Loss of food sales and volumes in a solid Metcash price base could amount to around 13 million US$ on the profits before tax, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash loses its share in the markets in the eastern states, mainly towards Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that the buyers in the IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, and its market share decreases from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Hamish Douglas Fund, founder of the Magellan financial group, said trade lunches in Melbourne could "be very likely to disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to react publicly to Douglas' comment.
But it is known that a member of Metcash's delegation contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA fell from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and Metcash's food market expenditure, which delivers about 1200 retail IGA , fell by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the change in speculation, as sales and outputs are under pressure.
However, the wholesale has gone into the counter and invests more than USD 150 million annually to compare spot prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and thus helps small IGAs to re-equip trades by adding fast-growing food and news from privates.
Executive Director Metcash, Ian Morrice, claims that the price adjustment programmes and the supply of transactions capture the fall and hopes that the grandparent will return to the basic profit growth in 2017 first in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Dennis Australia Steve Healym
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his respect rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a further loss in recent behavior around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves his praise rather than criticism, says President Dennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a young member of a talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention to himself due to the affair with an unappreciative Kyrgyz and Stan Wawrinko on Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a highly qualified match in Cincinnati, they had to be Kokkkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison twice separated by the judge, Harrison then said, "The lawyer had one to pull Kyrgyz and I had to pull him too."
While he was last seen smashing the rocket after the cracker seized Richard Gasquet's potential power at the US Open, Kokkinakis was invinciblely defending Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he is struggling with Sam Groth to settle in the second two-storey behind Bernard Romice in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I thought quite intensely that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little stuck in the whole dispute," Healy says.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost due to a cricket in the US, but he's not the first player to kill himself for frustration. I know Thanasi's pretty well and I can say he won't be proud of this event.
But he really managed very well because he was exposed to a very provocative situation in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a great deal of recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, and he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and he's falling into a team great and so on, he never had a problem with other players, he's very respected in the closet, he's training hard, he's in a wonderful condition, he's a very stable and successful young boy, and I just think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to look at Kyrgios for an important match that starts on Friday, and states that the "co-decision" is the right solution for all, but supports the family from Canberry to return to the team as a long-term standstill.
"In the first place, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not on all the controversy that has arisen around him [Kyrgios]," Healy says.
And I think Nick got up very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, in the public's eyes he's growing fast, made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he's got, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time outside the broadcast, when he can think about it, is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and also for him himself.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders and holds migrants
Following the announcement of the state of danger, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who tried to violate it in a way that would stop the flow of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants gathered in the country and Serbian authorities responded in protest.
Those who stuck to the unknown time on the belts of the country between the two states are those who run away from domestic violence, establish their states, and stay.
But there's a sense of frustration coming.
When the helicopter passes over them, the migrants call together "Open Borders!" and give the regular units to the Hungarian police.
Some reject food and water for protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister declares that it was "unacceptable" to send refugees back from Hungary, while they are still more coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just direct interest.
During the next few days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Concerns at the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the bloc of 28 states did not come with a single immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece and spoke with hope of reaching a possible agreement next month or at the end of the year, which EU nations would adopt more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
Germany's Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria allowed the European Union's special summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not put its hopes in Brussels or its neighbours.
The internal threat situation in two southern regions gave the authorities greater power to resolve the crisis and allowed them to close the roads and speed up cases of asylum negotiations.
Meanwhile, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szyjarto said his country is also planning to build a plot along the border with Romania, to stop refugees who are trying to cross their country when the plot is now completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agate reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped to pull the remaining wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main point of weakness and entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled from Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, the President of the Government of Viktor Orban argued that most of them are economic migrants who go to a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, which is a view that is clearly different from other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalize the 4-metre breach of the area, which the government has allowed to build on the southern border with Serbia, and also establishes longer prison times for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares its threat," Zoltan Kovacs spokespersons in the southern town of Szeged told reporters.
In this we are quite clear: the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, Parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army that was waiting for next week, but the reporters of the Associated Press on the border observed a heavy armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orbana's counsel for domestic defense, said that the authorities caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 were already trapped in the state.
They have been found using the damage to the area and are now accused of committing violations under new laws in police custody.
The authorities quickly allowed the plot to be fixed.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using the train covered by the rest of the wire.
At the main border crossing in Roszke, chaos arose because the Hungarians opened a small office in the metal container for processing and caused pressure from people.
About 20 of them came in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main road connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's strike in front of Bernie Sanders reduced by half in national vote
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-digit strike at the Democratic Competition on the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is reaching her strike.
Clinton now supports 47 per cent of the democratic primary votes (down from 58 per cent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he wants to become president, is receiving support from 15 per cent of the democratic primary wishes.
More than five months before the start of the main competition, the most democratic voters claim that they are too soon to say that they are clear decisions the candidate will support.
But the Clinton sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost his ground under his feet in several demographic groups, while Sanders gained several.
Clinton maintains a big gap between women and reduces, but her leadership is getting worse.
Her support between men has been significantly reduced and Sanders loses only 5 points on it.
The benefits of Clinton with democratic voters under 50 have been exhausted and are now equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has great leadership because of his older wishes.
Last month, Clinton had a double jump in front of Sanders between liberals, but now Sanders loses only 5 points in this group.
About half of the democratic primary will in all states says she would be very supportive of Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support her with certain awards and another 15% would only support her for being a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It's probably not surprising that the present attachments of Clinton are due to her particularly insanity.
The views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only a quarter would be very supportive.
While 48 per cent of democratic primary voters say that they would be very supportive of Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's guests are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), follows that it is time to be the president of a woman (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for this job (10 per cent).
Clinton's guests also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
In addition, there is a great possibility of election and harmony on problems.
While the vice-president is considering a potential candidacy for the president, 57 per cent of the democratic primary wishes would like him to face it - a third would think he should not run again.
When the primary democratic voters were questioned, whom they would choose as the second choice for the party's nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
One of Clinton's supporters introduced more than half of Biden as their second choice, far from Sanders.
If Biden decides to ignore the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's leadership extends from 20 points when Biden is running, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of the democratic will sees Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning in the general election; however, this number fell from 78 percent last month.
Poor is far from second, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely electorate is increasing.
However, when it comes to the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems before a greater election opportunity.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate does not appear to be an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key features among their party's primary voters.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Poor of all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of the democratic primary wishes don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, so twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have that view on him.
The primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
As far as all these measures are concerned, there is no opinion on Sanders, about a quarter of the democratic will.
As regards Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal e-mail and the server as the public secrets continue, most of the primary democratic wills are satisfied with her explanation of this issue and say that their overall view did not affect her at all.
But among the American public, it's a completely different story.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only a third are satisfied.
The public’s views on this issue were divided in March, shortly after this problem emerged.
Most Americans claim that this e-mail controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent of their views on Clinton have deteriorated.
It's mainly about Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim that their views on Clinton have deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is perceived as honest and reliable among her party voters, this question is still a problem among registered voters in general: only 32 percent see her as honest and reliable, which is a decrease of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered volunteers don't think she's honest and trustworthy.
And at the same time, 55 percent of registered voters throughout the country also don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were best guided in honor.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of fans didn't think of him.
The error rate for sample 351 of the primary democratic will is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up behind Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times
Two candidates are responsible for half of the votes in the latest survey and the others are failing to provide support.
Voters from a number of Republicans throughout the country continue to support the Trump Drive by most, and they have grown from 23% of the support in the last CBS survey carried out prior to the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The research also found that Carson is a good leader of demographic groups, and he cuts Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and the governor of the state of Ohio John Kasiche, is behind the Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, entirely in favour of 10%, fell to the current 2%.
Former Governor Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckbee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The error rate of 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and it happened in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson had improved and achieved 19% of the support among the Republicans for Trump 32% of the support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
At the rising trend of Carson, Trump decided to take the shot to the neurosurgery in service, and even Carson apologized for questioning about Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of the Death of the Student of the First Year Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died during a brotherly ritual in Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a charge of murder was filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chuna "Michaela" Deng at the beginning of the ceremony in September 2013 and took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police announced.
The police say he had closed eyes, he had 30 pounds full of sand on his pockets, and he was charged again when he tried to reach the target over the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches and then fell unconscious.
The members of Pi Delta Psi's brotherhood didn't call 911 right after Deng passed away, and they probably waited an hour before they took him to the hospital, the police said.
However, they found time to take over Dengo's dress, expose his symptoms and contact Andy Menga, the president of the entire brotherhood, and ask him for advice, the police chief Chris Vagner introduced to the press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their equipment and essentially gave preference to the prosperity of the brotherhood before Michael Deng," chief Wagner said.
He couldn't get back to life and died the next morning.
According to the drinking news, Deng was repeatedly hit with a dull object in his head, body, and feet.
"More than many families have been devastated as a result of overcrowding in the brotherhood, and at least one student dies every year because of overcrowding since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Dengo family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and its members must be responsible, and this step is important by the authorities.
The great jury of Monroe County recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Menga, will also be accused of assaulting overcrowding and crime.
"We want to keep not only those involved, but in case there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or informally, we will also take responsibility for it," Wagner said at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood broke down its relationship with local branches.
This happens when Fed increases interest rates
The increase in the rate will come and the bull market will collapse, the bonds will rise and the economy will collapse.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it takes and how long it's gonna take.
For the economy, it is specifically offering the story of a small source of time.
Recese came 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve System in increasing rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That's why US central bank officials stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when interest increases begin, but rather on how long it will take to normalise.
There are really more variables in the game.
Finally, however, members of the market can ensure that all traffic due to an increase in speed can be overlooked.
"The first increase in Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of 'illegal money'," said Julian Jessop, a global economy leader of Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of American interest rates to a more common but still low, creating a seismic shock that many might fear.
That means it's going to have an adverse effect.
Here's a view of how some areas of the economy will react on the basis of historical trends:
In view of what the market has recorded for the last few months, the expected increase in rates may make the air a little unsatisfied.
But once the increase occurs, the effect won't be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend towards re-stopping the action after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the gap in monetary policy again," analysts Deutsche Bank said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed increase.
More precisely, the market for the last 35 years is often - about 14 percent - aimed at increasing interest rates in a proportion of 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent) and then returns to normal status after 500 days, with an average result of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the main action strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the stock tends to become more pronounced later in the rate increase cycle and the return is beginning to decrease.
Recese is a real economic life, but increasing rates often help her.
Fed is currently facing certain conditions that have not yet existed and that could speed up the recession.
The most remarkable is that a rough domestic product closes to its lowest point in history when increasing the rate of Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, at 118 increases in rates since 1950, only twice the nominal average increase in GDP was 4.5 per cent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, few expected to maintain it when in the third quarter it was only 1.5 percent, says Atlanta Fed.
Increased rates in this complex economic background could be risky and could be a question of "if this time is different," said Deutsche.
The market participants were preparing for the growth of Fed all year round, and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Committee for the Free Market, which took place this week and ended on Thursday.
While many strategies and economies believe that FOMC could approve growth at this meeting, future trading only indicates a 25% probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the expansion cycles up until now have been in the super cycle of increasing the package effect with HDP covering the beginning of the recession very quickly after the start of the recovery," the report says.
On the contrary, this was a markedly slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is far longer than the Fed expected since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are 74 months and we continue.
The firm profit was also volatile because the market expects a rise in interest rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the stock is experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more visible in bonds than in actions when Fed changes policy direction.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the income changes direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/reduction cycle.
At the end of the cycle, the rise in the value of the bonds falls immediately," Deutsche said.
Strategic Charles Schwab believes that the increase in interest results in a closer relationship between long- and short-term bonds, which is equal to the curve.
The high-performance bonds often work better in this climate, even though "we are still careful about increasing the yield," stated in her analysis Kathy Jones, a firm analyst for fixed income in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already adapted to expect Fed's policy.
"In addition to the strengths of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are a number of signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for a more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is larger, the credit spread has expanded and the volatility has increased - all market characteristics when Fed promotes politics.
In general, companies that carry out most of their business in the United States win after a rise in interest rates and local products become more attractive.
A lot of debt will become worse for the supranational company, as the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the area of the world market and their debt will also be higher.
"History shows that the "quality" of the action tends to prevail over the course of three months after the initial increase in interest rates," analysts Goldman Sachsen said in a customer report.
Strong-balance-sheet companies had poor development companies in each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 on an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital outputs, as well as low-volatility stocks, also exceeded their benchmarks by 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of mobile interest rates lose most," Goldman said.
Besides purely action games, consumers also demand the increase in the dollar.
The contestants can also see their profits through higher performances, but experts have different opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, hard-earned MEP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "suffering"
It remains the view that the more unrecognizable he is than his commercial rival
He's also focused on BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating on the British.
Ambassador's colleague Damien Collins attacked Voice and says he's not even the original idea
BBC Radio 3 "changes" in Classic FM, claims front MPs and gathers fresh pressure on broadcasts to prove that they are doing something they do not do commercial broadcasts.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the heads of the BBC that the public service broadcasting station seems to be "complicated" and is more unrecognizable than his commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be--I hate to use the word "accumulated"--but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards that started last year seemed to be British under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that attack me, when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC accused of refusing to give reasons for the fact that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial rival with regard to live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn't learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to living music and creating music is actually at peak level.
"I think that the commitment of Radia 3 to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Regulator Radia 3 Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to involve the audience than before, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that got under fire because of smoking on foot to commercial competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the Commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a music talent show that BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talpa Media at a estimated price of £22 million.
See why this program is being discussed as a non-original and in no way different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the seventh star Paloma Faith andBoy George as a judge - was produced "as typical for BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "run a hit from its own state" when it's next starting a fun series.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of more future series of The Voice series or the loss of the money of licensees of the license fee to other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and on wine can be black Friday
The first three months of 2015 recorded 7% increase in online sales
Last month the lowest growth has been recorded since the year 2000 when the record itself began
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago by mobile shopping
Experts believe that November's Black Friday could be the cause of a break-in
More than a decade ago, virtual shopping was on the rise, and thanks to it, many of the British main streets became cities of spirits.
However, experts claim that there are signs of online sales fixing, and new data show a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August was the lowest growth increase since the beginning of the 2000 measurement, with an increase of only 5 per cent compared to last year.
Experts claim that there are signs of online sales fixing, and new data show a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the growth level in the past years and go back to 2000, the situation has always been rationalized," says the Guardian Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Market Index.
It explains that internet sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the couch.
But now (growth) is getting a bit slow, and that's why it seems to be slowing down.
The phenomenon of the Black Friday, which was claimed from America, is quoted as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could withhold purchases from this event, which will take place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average buyers turned to their computers for purchases and agreed to several sales websites.
Experts believe that a black Friday, by which buyers contract again, can keep customers from other purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of each £5 was lost online.
For some products, such as televisions and towels, more than a third of sales are carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online, a place to buy in stone fashion shops.
The Muslims buried the victims of the fall of the mine in Mecca and the family of Bin Ladin was sentenced
The bodies of 29 dead were transferred by the streets of Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partially throws wine for the collapse of the construction magnet Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health stated that a total of 394 people were also injured after the mine was broken
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the fall of the mine in Grand Moscow in Mecca.
Dressed to a certain degree in white, the mourners chose the journey and gave up respect for the victims when the first of the fallen ones got on his last trip to the graves in Al-Moais.
The sad message was passed around the holy place, where only a few days earlier the construction site was exposed to the roof of the mixture and turned to the believers.
The body was released for burial, and the Saudi king was punishing the building group of bin Ládina over the disaster that also left 394 wounded.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of the mine in Grand Central Moscow in Mecca were carried by the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children of Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first journey when the mine was gone.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Moscow with his parents before the start of the annual holiday trip of Hades.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hague will take place in Mecca, and thousands of people continue to enter the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group should not have left a shoulder hedge up when it was not in operation.
The Arabic version of the statement, not by the state operated by the Saudi Press Agency, indicates that Binladin Group is partly liable for the loss.
The English service of the disc agency did not report this detail, but stated that the company's bosses were prohibited from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to discover what led to the fall of the mine into the Court of the Great Mix, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were covering before the Hadz journey later this month.
The Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the mine and were not made available to its representatives for comments.
The Royal Statements also accused the group of not using the latest security measures and of lack of coordination with weather officials.

Chief B&Q claims that Eastern European traders already working for the cheap fashion trend
Britain still employs more dealers, Veronique Laura claims
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is below the growth point
As a result, 200 Screwfix shops focused on traders are open
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets all over the country
Rupert Steiner, main correspondent for Daily Mail
Brits are putting off bets and jokes and hand them over to trained Eastern European dealers to work at their home
If you're dealing with a bet or a painter's joke, you seem to be in a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employed by traders to do cutting jobs at their home, according to the head of the company for Screwfix B&Q.
Veronica Laura, the new Executive Director of Kingfisher, who owns a home network, claims that the large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 other Screwfix shops focused on traders and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laura claims that she wants to employ more women in B&Q shops, because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are doing better half.
Most male workers are currently employed.
She said there was a need to address the growing demographic trends that show more women's households that are undergoing more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says, "We still work in shops with most men.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% decisions about buying goods.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laura, who is only one of five women in the company's front yard according to the British FTSE100 index, also restructured her peak team to reflect the balance between the managers of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost alone in having half the representation of women between employees, including executive and financial directors.
Mrs. Laura said, "It was a conscious decision - the diversion is an important topic here.
So it wasn't hard to find the good women we'd take to us.
Kingfisher announced a loss as a profit in the middle of the year and sold after the group took on the costs of closing the shops.
The result of Kingfisher's trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new shops
Prosin's contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is in danger.
"It is the justice of equal wheat, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of accountability.
The President of the ODS Members Zbyněk Stanjura noted that the one-time contribution was sounding good, but it would have been better for the long term to be in the standard valuation because it would have been in the next years.
"We have room to find the mechanism that we will arrange," said Stanjura.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michael Marks (ČSSD), which was to be valued next year over the scope of the law.
Marks' contribution was based on an argument that would improve the social situation of the unemployed, which is not pink.
A higher valuation next year would mean a budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns, and ministers are discussing each tribe.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) recalled that in the past, the rate of valuation has decreased.
The rapporteur, Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real income in 2016 and later.
This right of payment in December makes it very difficult and perhaps impossible, he said.
The president of the ČSSD Roman Sklenák MPs therefore proposed a shorter time limit for the discussion of the standard in the committee for ten or 20 days, and that was blocked.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should be worth a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
Money should come from the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs budget in particular.
In the next year, the income should increase on average about fat.
The contribution should be made according to the retirement age of people who will have a claim for pension in December or part of it.
They could get it, even those who lost their pension pension in December before they paid it.
However, they would have to apply for the supplement in writing, not later than the end of next year.
In the Czech Republic, pensions are regularly valued for ice, which is about price growth and a third of real wages growth.
This year, the pension corresponds to 41.5 per cent of gross wages, next year it should be 40.5 per cent.
According to the State Final Account 314,7 billion crowns, which amounted to about five billion more per year.
Expenditure on old-age pensions was 26 per cent of all budget expenditure and 46 per cent of all statutory expenditure.
The average total old-age income increased in the year according to data in the State Final Account of 104 to 10,714 crowns.
The Czech Social Security Administration has secured the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 reasonable pensions.
Jakunin has abandoned his plans in his political career, he's going to dedicate himself to science.
The Senate chair, however, was almost certain by the Russian media.
The Council of the Federation should represent the Kaliningrad Zapora region, whose Governor Nikolai Cukanov as the candidate of the government of the United Russia held his post in Sunday's elections with a review.
According to the Russian laws, senators do not choose citizens, but they choose the governor from three candidates, whose name will be announced before the governor's elections.
After the election, the senator of three candidates will choose his own.
The complication for Jacuzzi was that in the Kaliningrad area he didn't do as the law requires.
Although the Kremlin for Jaconina found an exception, it is an extraordinary and powerful ambassador on whom the legal requirement for long-term stay does not apply.
The film of the Czech comedy Theory tiger is over.
The last trap in the preface of the main hero is the voluntary death of his body, to which strength and endurance came.
Granny - Iva Janžurová has decided on Grandpa's life, age and burial.
Janvi is clear that he is on a similar path with his wife, Olga - Eliška Balzer.
He remembers that once he had his own will and dreams, he wants to live again decently and freely.
He wants to get the government back on his life - and as a solution to choosing to escape from this present one, he led to the story of Slavik.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would be to Bartowski, with whom he had already collaborated on the Invisible Series.
However, he was surprised by the actor who appeared before the camera after a long pause associated with the rehab after a serious illness.
We made a deal three years ago.
I gave him the script and he said he likes how sad he is.
And he surprised me that he's probably a fucking sportsman.
In the past, before filming, he always asked where he was going to sit.
This time he rode on a bike, he walked down the stairs, and he even went to the hill.
And it's all in the record tropical waters, the director's undercover.
According to Bartoška, women take tigers to make him a king.
They're gonna feed him a little bit, but they're gonna close the door so he doesn't happen to play outside the rabbit on a tiger.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie, the actor commented.
His wife, who can act slightly negatively on the viewers, created Eliška Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also nice, smart, empathic, and she thinks it's good.
But at the same time, she's a kidnapper and wants her husband dead, subjugated Bajgar.
The film also resembles the fates of Jan's married daughter Olinka and Allenka - Tána Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and of the daughters of Erika and Pepika - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The producer is Petr Erben from the company Logline Production, co-producers Česká tvie and Rzłas and TV Slovensko.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The American internet company Google promised to provide another $5.5 million (132.6 million CZ) to organisations that help thousands of refugees streaming to Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday at Google.org, which is charitable to this internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled Telic's part of the visit to criticise human rights violations.
The Czech Member of the European Parliament for the move of the ANO Pavel Telička has postponed the fourth trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities have now cancelled the official part of the visit.
According to Telika, this is the reason why the EP resolution last week criticises the violation of human rights in Azerbaijan, which Telika was co-author.
By decision of the Azerbaijani party, Telicka discussed the possibility of discussions with the official partners and also the visit of political prisoners, which depends on the agreement of the authorities, explained in his press statement by the Brussels office.
The road, which was planned several months ago, was intended to use Telica to meet with Parliament's leadership and executive representatives, as well as with the representative of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, to clarify the text sent by the CTC.
The EP resolution condemns "invisible repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
She called on European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was adopted shortly after a recent decision on Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadiz Ismail, who was committed to the discovery of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not decide that it builds its air base in Syria.
During a visit to Novosibirsk, Bogdanovski did not rule out the existence of a Russian aviation base in Syria in the future.
We don't have plans yet.
But nothing's excluded, he said.
Russia already has an airport base in the port of Tartus, which has been more used as a service and logistics centre in Syria.
According to Russian press reports, but from the beginning of August, supplies of Russian weapons and military material to Syria have stopped.
According to Moscow, the arms shipments are from the existing trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to establish an air base in Latakia, which for the time being remains the heritage of Syrian President Bashar Asada.
But Washington has no specific military intentions for Russia in Syria quite clearly, American commentators agree.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United States John Kerry spoke to Russian counterpart Serge Lavrov on Tuesday about the situation in Syria, which has been their third telephone conversation for the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is released to Moscow to explain concerns about the gathering of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
The White House speaker Josh Earnest pointed out the support of Asada from Moscow for the lost bet.
Russia's policy objectives in Syria have said they are more unclear.
According to him, Moscow made its satellite from Syria.
It can mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, it's not quite clear.
The war in Syria is to be the main theme of Putin's today speculation at the upcoming UN General Assembly in New York.
On the contrary, the Russian leader does not intend to talk about the situation in Donbasa.
According to today's report by The New York Times, the U.S. government does not rule out that President Barack Obama and the Russian President could meet at the UN meeting.
The views between the White House's advisors are still on the move.
Tass Agency today, referring to the words of the Kremlin speaker Dmitry Peskov, wrote that Putin had not yet met with Obama on his New York stay's program.
Put sesame oil on the stomach diet, the couch helps to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the stress of unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra paneon oils.
All healthy substances will remain in the oil when the seeds are removed from the cold.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of a health diet, such as gums.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
These are, according to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, the most common cause of Czech death for several years.
Chestnuts are mostly affected by women, helping with sesame oil.
If you are one of the lovers of the Asian cuisine, you must not be in a state of a lack of sesame oil, which is part of the original recipe for exotic food.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in heat treatment and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the stomach diet.
Essential fatty acids that contain are a good prevention of the formation of gum stones.
These are caused by 90% of breast-feeding, and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
In general, the problems with the stomach are related in particular to people with overweight who do not export and consume many animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be used successfully for the liver diet, which is very similar to that of the stomach.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits of this oil consumption, they should pay attention to the products from exotic food trade.
Producers from Asia often use dried seeds that have a greater taste.
Oil, however, is about all the active substances, said Ladislav Haczecký, the executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic to Sokolovska, which produces bio virgin oils poured into the cold.
The company also manufactures oil and uses exclusively unsolicited seed of the white season.
In an hour, our leaves will be able to hatch eight kilos of sesame.
The raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees by mechanical distillation, which is why the product meets the criteria for extra panning.
At higher temperatures there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil thrives in heart disease and worms.
The Czech favorite among the oil is the sunflower.
From a study by Jarmily Hamerska, who conducted at the University of Masaryk, it appeared that he prefers 43% of respondents in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for the digestion, but at 180 °C it begins to be overheated.
For example, it is better to use it for the treatment of salads and is especially suitable for diets that help prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which from all fatty acids most reduce cholesterol levels.
In the case of heart problems, attention should be paid to the total amount of fat and calories taken.
For example, in a single layer of sunflower oil, 62 calories are available, 99 calories are available in the layer of rape oil.
With regard to the energy value of food, it is important to realize that the natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than the so-called free calorie.
These are part of industrially managed products.
That's why it's appropriate to wash extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last as long as the moon and the moon for nine months.
The storage in the refrigerator is still prolonged.
The old oil people get to know, in particular, according to the burning taste.
On the contrary, there's no pit on the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Common oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of the technical rope are used for so-called superfoods, and therefore the canned oil is considered to be the most healthy of plant oils.
For this labelling, thanks to the maximum content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot produce the body itself, and a person must take them from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study of scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, instead the Icelandic take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Common oil is appropriate to be included in the food container as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and when healing wounds.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential component of cell membranes.
People don't have to worry about the use of rope oil, they don't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumption confirms the fact that in Bohemia Oil is one of the most sold.
It's sold 500 liters a year.
People often use one lie extra hard after the wound.
The oil is not a tasteful, but is a great boost to immunity, Daniel Vlček of the great company Bohemia Oil.
According to the statistics, they're the most passionate people in the United States.
There's 1.4 grills in one house.
Then all over the world, there are the most diverse competitions in grilling, which only confirm the success of these cooking disciplines.
They're not even Czechs.
On the basis of consumer research in the Czech market, we find that only 4% of the people in the world have not been grilled.
The simple majority of them go to bed several times a year.
To make the grilling successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the seams for several hours before heating.
Which oil is most suitable for this, and at the same time, when it is grilled, will leave the health of a beneficial substance?
It is generally true that you should be treated in your own grilling process.
Experts agree that much of the oil begins to lose its taste at high temperatures.
The healthy extra virgin oil then comes from the body of a beneficial substance, which is otherwise obtained when it is consumed by the oils from the creams managed at lower temperatures.
This does not mean, however, that extra virgin oils will not find their application in grilling.
Horrible oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When the meat is said, the oil is immediately supplied to the experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslic to Sokolovsk.
It's a great addition to the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen there is a unique feature of increasing natural tastes of food.
It is also suitable for roasting and grilling, because it has a high level of burning up to 216 °C.
Even in such a high temperature, therefore, as one of the few oils preserves the health of a beneficial substance, describes the benefits of Daniel Vlček's horticultural oil from the company Bohemia Oil, which belongs to few Czech producers of this oil from the vine.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in combating the excess cholesterol.
Our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals in the thick oil.
Due to the beneficial content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
We also help to enhance our outer beauty - that is, improves the elasticity of the skin, is used to treat the liver and helps to care for dry and mucous membranes.
The chefs appreciate the use of the vegetable oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold creams, for example for the cooking of salads, but also for the heat treatment of the creams.
It can then be used immediately in two ways, in navigation and in private grilling.
We're keeping the meat and fish at bay.
Three ingredients must be present in the preparation of the marina: oil, acidity and root.
For example, oxygen is supplied with an octopus, and it is used to soften the mass.
He adds a lot of flavor and oil to the right rice, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that the horrid oil is ideal for marineization because as one of the few oils, it can break through dark meat.
So the marine meat or fish are ready to grill, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are indicated by the fact that only a few caps are sufficient for the preparation of meals.
The same applies to grilling.
Some oils are for this way of preparing a simple taboo.
This applies, in particular, to flax, hemp and rape oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before the grilling itself, shake the oil, prevent the burning of food.
The essential part of the grilling is also the preparation of the annexes.
The grilled mass and fish fit practically anything - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
The chefs of Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, the salad of Horké summer.
You need it: • 1 pan • 1 cup of towels • 1 cup of baked corn • 1 cup of mixtures of salad leaves • 3 juices of grape oil
Add to the salad table a mixture of salad leaves with a hand-cuffed hook and a large brush-cuttered brush.
Depending on the taste of the sauce and the opera, you can also taste the milk chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, dig a few drops of rose oil.
For exceptional taste, then you can salad with finely baked almonds.
Diluted sclerosis: not only depends on the treatment, but also on the patient’s willingness to fight.
Several sclerosis is a complicated disease, and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: neurologists, physiotherapists, ergot therapists, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologists, psychiatrists and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about treatment, for example, women with multiple sclerosis need consultation if they are to have a child, they also include social counseling, recommendations on housing, etc.
However, all of this is not enough: the development of the disease can primarily affect the patient itself.
The longer the disease becomes active, the longer it can work and the more it needs to change the style of its life.
As doctors have pointed out, the patient’s passiveness relaxes the area for the disease’s activity.
For example, it has been shown that regular movement significantly distances the time when the patient needs some compensation aid, such as a shelter.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not suffer from various myths, such as that disease is automatically leading to the end of the vehicle.
And that's why this page was created. Take a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Take a chance.
The most important person in caring for a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, it has been said twice that the disease is beginning to treat before, the more the doctor can influence something.
It's because we have medications on a multiple sclerosis at an activated stage, when the neurodegeneration process is not so strong yet.
The sooner we get hit, the greater the hope is that we will be able to stop the disease and remove the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from Neurological Clinics The General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis of rehabilitation care, which most often solves the weakening of lower limbs or imbalances.
He works with patients according to their individual needs: keeping the condition, improving the pace, strengthening the pancreas, reducing swallowing disorders or improving coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on the specific patient's difficulties," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, Chief of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic Faculty Hospital in Motola.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but in every way it occurs a little differently.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always mitigate its symptoms.
However, the movement activity also strengthens the immune state of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive regular exercise is the fact that the sick are verifying what they can do, and it strengthens their confidence.
"In practice, the endorphins are also washed out and a person feels good about it," warns PhDr. Kamila Рāsová of the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinic Faculty Hospital of the Royal Vineyard.
By influencing the physical site, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotion.
That's how we get into the psychiatry and immune processes, and we stabilize the disease, it adds.
"In the past, these patients have been treated so well, today we know they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, the priority of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic Faculty Hospital in Motola.
The purpose of physiotherapy is to make it possible for humans to remain as self-sufficient as long as possible, including job placement.
Physical therapists therefore cooperate with ergot therapists so that each person can receive compensation with his ear in peace.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult situation.
When you get a serious illness, most people will blow it up.
They're experiencing shock, panic, fear.
He has to respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a troubled soul, we have to follow someone, not try to take everything into our own misery.
"I work with them in such a way that they finally conclude that even with disability, you can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis doesn't mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Neurological Clinics of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague latecoere manufacturer, airbuses didn't fly.
Aerial production is a synonym for accuracy and advanced technologies.
New aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials, which can't be manufactured and processed immediately.
However, next to the superprecious, computer controlled processing machines, next to the autoclaves for the composition of composites, you can hit something as common as the meroon pecks.
In the drum, which reminds us of the potion on the sugar pot, in the oven, the edges of the folds that have just been removed from the milling machine are popular.
"No one has ever come to a better conclusion," laughs Ivan Dubsk, Director General of the Latecoeer Air Door Manufacturer of the Czech Republic.
In the area in Prague, the former Summer complete door for Airbus A320 is produced.
As the only one in the world, they deliver the door to Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, which are part of Prague, also enter passengers into the first and higher class on the upper decks of the world's largest aircraft Airbus A380.
Here are also the doors of full compositions for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Preciseness is the main motto here.
Maybe the current key leaves the company to settle twice a year.
If there is a lack of control on the yellow sticker, they should explain in the Prague competition to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing who drive regularly to determine whether the doors are manufactured in accordance with the agreed rules.
But advanced technology hasn't completely broken up yet.
On one door to A320 there are 1500 knots.
The netizens have to tear their hands apart.
It takes them two days.
And according to the sound of the falling anchor, they know if they're already being used properly.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The surface of the aeroplane may be nestled from zero to 0.13 millimetres.
That's about double the fat of human hair.
A number of trained hmats will come to check.
When the controller moves his finger over a number of uses, he knows if he's out of tolerance.
Then we'll take the exact trigger.
Flying before 1989 was a program of the L-39 military aircraft exercise.
Only in 1991 did not produce one.
The company had to find new orders quickly.
At that time, it was combined with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
He won the selection procedure for the emergency door supplier for model A321.
The contracts with Boeing weren't so happy.
"We were for them at that time a small company that did not have enough money to invest and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stable supplies," Dubsk recalls.
The door to the U.S. producer would remain open if Latvia did not attend the Prague International Association of Air Industry of the French Latecoeer Group in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The second day the conversation with France broke out, said Dubsk.
A year later, Latecoe bought a Czech company and a strong company came up with new orders.
The assembly of the parts of the door for A320 was immediately opened in 2000.
Three years later, the upper deck door for A380 was closed.
In 2006, the company built a new hall for the processing of compositions due to supplies for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoe, we wouldn't get to these big orders on our own.
Maybe we could do parts or small parts.
Partners want guarantees for 20 or 30 years, explains Dubsk.
Last year, the Czech Latecoeer achieved a turnover of more than 2.9 billion and a profit of 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position between the supplier of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecore has invested 1.5 billion crowns in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special manufacturing processes certifications and certificates of qualification for key staff.
Without them, the firm would not have built a door to the aircraft.
Get certification that production processes meet customer requirements, and keep them in repeated checks according to the Dubsk million crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They're more precise and tighter.
We need to train employees, provide equipment and re-certify the whole process, he supplies Dubsk.
The company now completes the preparation of the process for the recycling of zinc and nickel, which replaces the present human health harmful cadmium.
The tasks were given by the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology to the devices or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing come, check the concepts of the whole line.
Then we'll lead them to the production.
They're checking our labs, too.
One set of samples are tested by themselves in their laboratory and then the results are compared to ours, approaching the Dub way the receivers control them.
In return, the Prague companies are long-term exclusive contracts.
The Prague race stands today and the production of embryos falls.
For A320, it produces half of the total volume of the door.
It is impossible to replace the Czech Latecoe for either a Brazilian or a European producer, or very complex.
But it doesn't mean he could say any price at the door.
Part of the contract is a price curve.
It shows how many doors one will stand after ten, fifty, the same pieces made.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We need to get into this price sample.
If we don't, we'll make it, says Dubsk.
Half of the halls, where electric boxes are completed for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft, are still empty.
But it's a symbol of the future.
Behind the wall is a new semi-robatic line for use and installation of the door for an innovative model A320 Neo.
It's fast and expansive.
"This is the trend that the assembly in aviation is wearing," Dubsk adds.
The rest of my future line is secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 pieces of a new A320 model.
Only a few meters away will create a line for the complete mounting door for the upper deck A380.
It's our parent company's strategic decision.
The aim is to cut production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin within two years, says Dubsk.
Before doing so, however, the company must pass the qualification tests required for the installation of some electrical and electronic equipment into the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also committed to further development of the production of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also be part of the new Airbus A350 programme, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit for the company when it can also process compositions other than metal materials," Dubsk says proudly.
However, latecoere is available in Czech Republic for production capacity.
There's no other place in the area of Letov, where he's staying.
Before the entry of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now it's 800 and within three years it could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of time, how many hundred new aircraft are operating each year, they don't have to be afraid.
Although he had orders for several years in advance, the parent company of Prague's latecoeer faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money for the September payment of the loan.
Finally, latecoeer was able to make a deal with the main believers.
At the end of August, their share of the loan changed.
In the company, the creditors received an increase of 57.4 million euros of 37.4 per cent.
The company's debt dropped by two thirds, which is 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company registered a new shareholding of EUR 222.9 million between the existing shareholders.
Totally, the basic capital amounted to EUR 280 million.
However, the whole group is looking forward to the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which accounts for 85 per cent of the market.
The average contract growth is expected to be four per cent per year until 2017.
The contract book has orders for 2.6 billion euros, corresponding to the four-year production.
The French media claims that latecoere can breathe again after years in the traps.
The Czech race in Prague is important for groups.
The Group's sales accounts for 16 percent.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign side group.
The envoys supported a greater share of the state's carbon charges.
The change in interest rates for the interest of the farmers is to contribute to the public savings of 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
According to the government, the budget revenue should have a neutral impact because the fee should be higher.
In the year preceding, the municipalities received about 450 million crowns and the state budget of 150 million crowns.
In the coal industry, there were about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns in the state.
Novela is also calculated with an increase in the yield of the area with a permitted weight on a thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The admission of these buildings shall continue to be to the full extent of the municipalities.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the MPs that this resulted in a total of 14 million to 100 million crowns per year.
The amount of the levy will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The refund shall be re-calculated as a component of the quantity of the exported malt and the rate for each species of malt.
According to the government, the change is due, inter alia, to a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, the ODS Ambassador Marek Benda warned that the establishment of a fee under the Government Regulation should not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mádka, it is not taxable in this case because the state is paying for a state-owned disorder.
Fees shall be granted only to the countries whose territories are concerned.
In the case of deep pressure, coal will receive three quarters of the city's money and a quarter of the state.
The same will be true in the case of the demand for radioactive mines.
The part of the money that stands on the charges of the charge will be specifically linked.
For example, 28 per cent will have to go to repair damage to the supply or to provide the Banyan rescue service.
Today's proposal was criticised by the opposition MPs, who said in particular that they would harm the local people affected by the burden and the countries.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostov) warned that the supply companies would no longer want to sponsor the locals as they have so far, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kádner (Usvit) elected in the Ústek region.
Before the rise of unemployment in Mostecka, the KSČM MEP warned Han Aulicka.
Kádner and Auliká failed to propose to deny the novel, Kučera wanted the law to return the government to work.
The explanatory report states that, according to the companies concerned, the increase in fees does not lead to carbon prices, as prices are more than 90 per cent long-term leased.
The main consumers, such as power plants or heat plants, should therefore not feel a rise in prices.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that the supply organisations will make up for the increase in remuneration to compensate for the reduction of their operating costs, which would, above all, mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in wages from employment is profitable.
According to the report to the new Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is essential that Members know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and the government's decision on the limits of coal.
If the coal is too limited, then it will have consequences for the state and the country, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Youth that the decision to break the limit below the Czechoslovakian army should fall until 2020.
The thresholds below the ČSA should be broken for social, national and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching the US Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a key decision on whether to increase interest rates first after almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists under the Reuters agency found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because he's been sitting for years since the Fed reduced the rate to zero.
First, we are approaching the situation where the main central bank could be able to get out of zero summers and start the process of normalising interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of Peterson's Institute for the International Economy.
The US economy was relatively good, there was a refurbishment in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state's accounts and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets to be ready for an increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see a great chance against this step.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday 20:00 SEC.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on the same day as his colleague - wrote a message stating that he had a "flight" first murder and that he wanted to be able to take it back, found it in the Tuesday government.
Police in Gautier in Mississippi said Lamb, a professor of geography and social science at the State University of Delta, called the police on Monday morning about ten o'clock
And said he shot someone.
The rabbi asked him to send the police to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there is a "beautiful dog" in the house, which "will not poison anyone", but he is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb also didn't explain why he was shot in the house.
When the police arrived at the scene, 41 - year - old Amy Prentiss found a handwritten message from Lamb, in which she said: “I’m so sorry and wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving the message, Lamb went on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed the teachers of the history of Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
Dekan University William LaForge said he did not know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “there was obviously something in Mr. Lamb’s head.”
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in the romantic relationship of Amy Prentissov with Schmidt, government authorities have stated that there is "no evidence" about the mercy triangle.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss over seven years ago, said she was "a great person".
The divorce came 15 years ago, but both of them remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was the whole case "crushed".
O'Steen said Prenissa and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as Sun Herald reported, Prentiss was working from home over the Internet.
Knowles said that Prenissa, who had a hunting dog named Blesk, had been with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," she let Knowles hear.
The police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would not go to jail.
When the police arrived at the distance near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran into the woods where he was shot.
According to a bibliography published on the school’s website, Lamb received a doctorate in the field of education at Delta University in spring 2015.
The stars that lost their magic
Herec (left), on the picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years behind him.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and lost his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer in 2009.
Herec also reportedly had a drug problem, and in 2008 he was detained for holding drugs.
All these things are certainly choosing their own tax.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a couple of months out of the game for a double break.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of right legs during the Manchester United defeat in the League of Masters against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this wound in tears and removed it from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks that Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury caused a sudden move by Héctor Morena in 15 minutes when a 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes and needed an oxygen mask before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double fracture of his legs, and now he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe later and then operated in Manchester.
It's a terrible boy who comes to Manchester in 18 years, it's very difficult, but it plays fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in the closet, he also had an oxygen mask.
You're crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture requires six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group phase.
I believe he's still playing this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and a penal cup.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not persecute Mexicans.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian judge was wrong.
You can decide on your own whether it was a pen and a red card.
It was a very bad move with both legs.
Tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thanks to everyone for their reports, words can't express how destroyed I am, my journey to recovery begins now and I will return even stronger."
Related: Manchester United recorded Luke Shaw's injury in defeating PSV
The British defender will have added motivation to reinvigorate in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said, "It was a very serious injury."
If any player leaves the game with such an injury, each one is very sad.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt the opponents.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands in the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponents, and when you hear about the seriousness of such an injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I wasn't able to cut this moment.
I saw only the ball that directed the other way, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched him, but I didn't see a move on Luke.
In the SBS6 interview, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel really bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling.
David Cameron certainly knows The Lorax better?
This is what every parent knows: When a child loves a book, it doesn't take long to learn to remember it.
Of course, you can't be David Cameron.
On the question of children's schedules to name a favorite child's book, the president of the Government of Lorax, a story from Dr. Seuss of 1971.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Sudden, curious, creative and with strong content, I loved reading to my children because there was always a picture or message behind her that I had never seen before."
Well, until then, in the following paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the events of the book according to the 2012 movie lift, which added other characters and details to fulfill the written original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a compost, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl's dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see the real tree," is the book's content, which records the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it wasn't quite suspicious, the text added by Cameron is read as a total lift of Lorax, which is on the website of the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a compost, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was an open-minded parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would get to know the story of a book, where the so-called young man will learn that local nature is exacerbating the grass, trees striking industrialist Once-ler, who even through protests of the title Lorax, a cut-off, corned creature who "speaks about trees."
With the greatest probability so relatively little significant PR task received an assistant who never read Lorax's child 20 times in a piece.
Speaking Downing Street stated that the text was probably coming from Cameron's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text provided the employee of Cameron, but without any other comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of recollection of England, but still holds
Coping with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after looking at the team that England has chosen on this tour, I think it is unlikely to repeat the 3-0 defeat that she has suffered in the past in the trial series.
I wouldn't rule out a guest's victory either.
The Alastair Cooka site can be less experienced than that three years ago, but there are good spins here in this plunging facility and also collective thinking is strong; they do not bear the scars of 2012, only the youth's positive.
With the ball is Moeen Ali developing with Spinner and Adil Rashid, even though it is unknown at the level of the test series, it represents a striking possibility.
Related: Adam Lyth got out of the team of England in a series trial and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to remind Adam Lyth is a hard-on for me to analyze, because his main coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks under challenging and simple conditions, but the hard reality is that the players are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, there were no questions around the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because — and I have mentioned earlier — players are their best selections.
A few more centuries and Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Let's hope that if he can get more running for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The chief coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his position, even though his performance was not completely stagnant, and it didn't surprise me; it was always a team player.
The question of how much time the pilot gets to show himself is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven hats — like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance home and out.
The only thing you can stop for is that England gave Jonathan Trott’s first chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was in the best form — but this missed opportunity is already past.
Alex Hales is coming, and this is a thumb that I value very highly.
It's a x-factory cricket player that we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he won 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which he did a little bit.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all of this will, of course, depend on the overall assembly in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moeen starts on the side of Cook, who would get another extra spinner while keeping four quicks, was overcome and I don't have any excuses against her.
I don't understand why the strikemaker can't fire and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be a wonderful cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number three and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 tests before his performance in 2001.
At once, three centuries passed and he did not even look.
There's Zafar Ansari on the team as a backup sponsor, and when I was able to track him, he took me as a very active young man.
People can look at his rough statistics — an average of 31 with a pole and 35 with a ball — and I see it as a prom, but there are not many sprinklers who would raise their hands, and the electors decided for the young.
He'll learn a lot about this tour.
Despite the team, England seems to have made several changes and smart additions to their training staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardenea, the Sri Lankan pulverizer, as a consultant for the trials can be a master's move.
He is one of the most beautiful players who bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in the part of the white-ball tour and brings to the team both energy and non-military cycle.
I always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has an intelligence that can be used.
New voices in the closet, even though they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes relax and refresh the atmosphere.
A colly Durham Ben Stokes partner got a day off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I don't have a problem with this decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and selectors do not produce a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
The unimaginable renegotiation strategy of David Cameron for maintaining Britain in the EU is getting into other problems with every last day without the choice of brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the head of the Daily Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is suffering in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough of the British egocentric agenda, shared concessions and disruptive changes to the treaties that most of them did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided not to want social protection.
We can even call it the own agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the office go to the summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a photo before the famous local monument, with or without local values, and then come home with the words that they win the union for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain unpaid in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have reached the point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German discreetly balanced office, is a associate, but she was in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it gets bad, as it was for too long thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Francouz François Hollande faces a re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power also falls.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is hard to see how they fold their legs with the help of the Selfie Brits, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they do not want themselves because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the campaign before the 2017 referendum in Britain to speed up the Brexit process, a hard friend.
"The renegotiation has solved the problem" and "The British has nothing worth negotiating."
Europeans know for their own good how the Fleet Street can be and how sceptical to the EU are pressured oligarch barons, because they were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben in 1975, which supported our 1973 entry in terms of 2:1.
They can remember the name Boris Johnson, a leading Euro-opportunist who made his name the Brussels report "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his skill, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of non-payment tax collectors, foreigners hacking phones and pseudo non-sea departments that owned most of the big news.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she doesn't want you to have dinner and then have tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameroon's referendum routine, since Blair allowed the principle of a abolished EU constitution, which was filled with French and Dutch voters in 2005 and received a card of expulsion.
The press never fired him, either.
But my dear Jeremy Corbyn, who was making me a friend at Westminster on Monday - I told him that he must not waste his time on me - seems to be in danger of re-accepting the strategy of Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake at the time.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but with Andrew Marre, whose chair at the BBC left on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe, I'll say it's nice, they're developing.
He claims to want to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of the crazy Ukip trend and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderis can certainly come to this.
The same said Hilary "Bemm, but not Bennite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner shoe couldn't decide to allow Corby's appointment as an abrasive McDonnell as a shadow office to be a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 70 years when his old father fought on TV about his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's attack was much more attractive.
But fighting for us to remain "in all circumstances" - Benin's phrase - according to all that was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told colleagues and Members at their private meeting on Monday night,
Let them be the back of any sensitive picture that Corbyn wants to tell - do not forget, touch me - the discipline of the message remains important in the age of full-time television broadcasting and especially in faith, the parishioner's paranoia and betrayal, which are social media
It is fair not to give Cameron a free entry into Europe, which would allow him to respect the support of the Working Party in the referendum campaign, of course, as McDonnell stated.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corby's basic call for EU membership - in line with their Bennite-based economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric debate between left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of small differences is the central basis of dogmatic hysteria.
As with his statement regarding Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that JC campaign will not want to end - foreign diplomats will have to try to understand the meaning of all this for their domestic lords.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital - they also have suspected voters - because of Britain's concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the British's weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, and even by reducing the costs of the conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the Monday's start of something called the Security Forum of the British influence.
Experts criticise reviews of public health England's electronics agency
The government-funded agency's statement that electronic cigarettes are 95 % safer than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry, says researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in his report on the electronic cigarettes of the Public Health England (PHE).
PHE published a "mechanical" report last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of evidence."
However, a number of researchers questioned the scope of the data and noted the links between some experts and tobacco industry.
The head in Lancet's expert magazine last month attacked the "extremely chattel base", on which the PHE concluded its main conclusions.
Two other experts, who write for BMJ, questioned the claims that were allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They suggest that the public could expect that the statement by the PHE agency, which sounds "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking", are based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a meeting of 12 people allowed to draw up a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the damage associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the discussion were summarized in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose director-general had allegedly already received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the public health certification of BAT in the sustainability report, he said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting granted funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not funding that they allegedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they contain a number of well-known electronic cigarettes champions, some of which also declare industrial financing in the newspapers.
Some of the others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting in Phe also took part in tobacco management.
The report was produced in this group "exclusively allowed," lacking "strong evidence of the harmfulness of most products on most of the criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or limitations are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE claims that "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being in the PHE, stated that the claims in the BMJ had already been linked.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers dies because of their addiction.
All the evidence indicates that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small, but we still need to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die of smoking and smoking-related diseases per year, NHS is worth £2 billion a year.
With clear emphasis on current evidence - that although e-cigarettes are not at risk, only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should end with EastEnders, former Director Channel 4
Former Director Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give the right hand" for an emergency show like Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used for programs that are not created by other British television broadcasts.
The BBC criticised the fact that it has launched public service programmes, which are likely to follow only a handful of people, in difficult broadcast times against its rivals "the biggest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After Director-General Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had failed to connect with the BBC for six years that he worked on Channel 4.
"I fight the idea that the BBC will launch and broadcast programs that would certainly be broadcast rivals without state contributions," Johnson said in the Committee on Communication in the Upper Screening, as part of the BBC's future.
If you maintain a licence fee that I am not sure is in the medium or long term a good idea, the production should be reduced at least in terms of programs that others do not produce or produce.
They send The Voice in the main broadcast time because they want to get as wide a support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would send him is a ridiculous joke, and it's obviously inconceivable.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why regressive taxes should support programmes that can be financed without contributions.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course made on home ground.
Frankly, other channels would give them the right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasts are.
I don't think it would even weaken the BBC.
Johnson, a serial businessman who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC felt guilty by making ratings "for the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comment on the most popular BBC show repeats those former executive director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that BBC sell show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the more aggressive BBC public service programs "are going to go to BBC4, where it is quite often impossible to measure obsessiveness, but they fulfil their authority and can argue when they are on their cover mission to justify the receipt of £4bn from licensing fees, "But of course we are doing all these screening programs that nobody is looking at."
They're sending them out at a time when no one's looking at them.
With regard to the licence fee, the Johnson Commission said: "I urge you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value from it.
Of course, we all think that the 150 British pounds a year is a large sum, but for people who have 150 pounds a lot, I would be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look so much at the BBC.
Former Director Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should review its reitiv mission in the sense of "information, education and entertainment."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production was now already classified as education - it was 1% television production and 0.1% on the radio - and should be taken as a model of public broadcasts in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, explain and entertain."
About the Elstein partnership, he said the BBC should do more in areas like Proms, which were only broadcast on television, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
"Sonogenetics" or brain cells control using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction the tiles move.
Scientists have developed worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
A small slide changes direction at a time when sound impulses are affected, which are not audible to the human ear.
The pulses work so as to inhibit the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to react to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and record brain activity using light
Scientists have found that these worms are a great demonstration of a new methodology called sonogenesis that uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, stated for the Guardian journal that this method could one day replace a deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which patients are trained to stimulate electrodes that stimulate the brain. The method is used for example to treat Parkinson’s disease symptoms.
Slims usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction is delivered when it is placed in the fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, bubbles strengthen ultrasound waves, which then pass through the body of worms.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves operate in the ion channels TRP-4, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells they are connected to, is reported in the Nature Communications magazine.
In order to control the glands using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain the ion channels TRP-4.
Then, when using such modified worms ultrasound, sound waves were enhanced by microbublins and moved to worms where modified motor neurons were activated.
The new method is much like optogenetics, a progressive tool that allows scientists to shut down and shut down neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, lets hear that sonic genetics could have many advantages against this technique.
Unlike the light that must be sent by optical fiber to the required place in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate the tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment for the treatment of neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that his application would also be found in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.

A British arms trade adverts.
Look at the video about the arms market from Amnesty International.
Terrible killer drone!
The nails on the legs that'll break the ankles!
Shots!
And electric stunning shoes that cause unbearable pain, but they don't care about any traces!
A cheerful voice and metaphor karicature do not leave anyone in doubt that this advertising on the world's largest weapons fair is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to express the will of the British government to sell weapons to repression regimes through the defense and security facilities of the International Veselice in ExCeL Centre in the London district Docklands.

There are 300 posters created by artists who present their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
A collection called Special Patrol Group helped distribute across London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece Allen's key, which is allegedly "access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."

According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists go to work with activists in protest movements and realize that they have to get out of the real world to have their art impact on society.

The creative director of VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silent advertising of arms trade - he saw an empty space in the calendar ExCeL - and thought, "Let's show them a campaign that tries to avoid."
They played with creating more realistic risky corporate advertising, but "by adding sticky colors and animation, I've learned that there are more people on the ground."
"They took a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is that the government of the United Kingdom takes action and ensures that the torture facility is not unlawfully dealt with at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding arms trade comes from outside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In the press report, Saab discovered an order from the US army to "at the AT4CS RS. "
This includes "a uniquely designed head that provides amazing effects from behind the burning inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be nice.
Eight Golden Rules for Life at Student College
11 years ago, I moved to a college like a nine-year-old boy who still believes in bartage and moral relativism, but so far I am rid of the drunk smiles of those I've been dealing with - and lenient, prolonged complaints to others.
All I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The movement on the wheels can move from slightly to the nerves of the moving to the total destabilizing.
It's kind of silly to tell people where you're from, if you've taken a year's break, what you're thinking about Corbyn and why "you don't really love or just hate Marmite, because people, it's just a draw from the HAHAHA, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help the others to get up too - ask yourself and express your interest.
It's a conversation and it'll help you find people you like, and those you don't have to deal with, even if your lines were in one fire and they'd be giving out extinguishers.
Let's get some space.
People's rooms often change to drinking receptions, movie evenings and public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress and adjust their underwear.

The Introverts at high will come soon.
Your room should be a safe haven, yet a lot of people are changing on the extra room walking culture, which is friendly, social and contributes to a lifelong friendship.
It could be hell for someone who needs to be offered.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to know when your partner is tired of socialization - and maybe write him a place of hugging.
Now, when it comes to clapping, clapping.
One boy in my class used to say that if the door isn't locked, it's invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends through cooking.
Because you started going to the university at the top of the oven, hanging on a foreign door, and painting with a plate of sealed cakes seem to be less strange, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, something I've offended you, now laugh while I'm asking myself about personal questions."
Offering a domestic understanding is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and maybe it's all over so that your face will be geared to a pleasant surprise.
That's, of course, the subject of being a decent baker.
Badly condensed pieces of milk, sugar and thirst are likely to prevent others from dreaming when you try to knock them at the door.
Stealing food is a regular crime in student colleges.
The theft of the whole chicken is, of course, a crime, but is the drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Double check it with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're going to piss inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's boring and you have my sympathy - but try to arrange it a little more adults than my roommates who exchanged their milk by washing the furniture to make the thieves suffer.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make sounds that break people from sleep or study.
It's not only about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl from my walk asked her neighbors if they could shut down the drum and bass, because they were three at night and she had a letter in the morning.
Their answer was a strengthening of the music.
When they finally calmed down in five o'clock in the morning, she let her sleep for two hours and then left her own music loud, closed the door and went to her three o'clock letter.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future went to the same college as you?
And on the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely embarrassing if you were to confuse your fellow citizens for your future, sleep together, break up and have to see each day and maybe take control of your friends?
Of course, you won't order your heart - but if your sexy roommate is not your future though, at least try to talk to your weaknesses.
In an exciting moment when you realize that someone has left the keys in his unclosed room, there's only a thin border between fun and shaky.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Learn a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something from them - never destroy someone's room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock them in the door and put the keys in the bottle with the water you pour into the freezer - but never stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eve was excited about the twins, and despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva's been through a good time in her pregnancy with her seven-year-old Vite.
His father broke up with her and she was alone in the preparation and education of the offspring.
With the situation, I settled relatively quickly - I was very happy with the child and looked for a positive one.
Uncertainty and being alone with the child, I tried not to get hurt.
And I certainly had the hope that we wouldn't be alone for long, Eve remembers her first pregnancy today.
By then she had met on the Internet in the chat of the older Vashka, who had started to talk to her about the favorite movies.
Your Eva and Vitka even brought home from the birthplace, but the role of a non-owner's father did not get too close.
"Sometimes he got out of the program," Eva described in the documentary series Four in that 3.
The reason for the third series of Czech TV series is just looking for happiness for a second attempt.
The family’s care for Vicka and financial security was supported by part-time work and great assistance from her aunt and aunt.
Nor did the view of responsibility for a foreign child finally show his affection for Eve.
They definitely went together around Vicki's second birthday and now he understands Vaska as his father and so does he.
Although your daughter already has two grown daughters, the father of the 60s uses her words, and the children are also more devoted.
In addition to the Vítka, there was another two-year-old Leonty and finally a two-year-old.
"Your family has been so naturally involved, perhaps by the fact that my mother never talked to me much," she thinks she's smiling.
A little place?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ela were born into the emperor’s line after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy at the end of pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of cartilage acids, which then appear in excess of the amount of blood pregnant and are particularly witness.
Insomnia is dangerous for an unborn product that threatens premature birth and death, in mothers after birth it is usually self-absorbing.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Evin and Vashko, although they were only 36 weeks old.
Emička was placed in an incubator in an intermediate department, where he also works for Vaskov's netizen, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and right after moving from JIP to room, I had her with me, describing the delivery period after Eva's birth.
She spent 20 days in the womb until the doctors agreed to release a minima that, in the meantime, managed to reach the limit of two pounds.
Waiting for the arrival of children at the birth of Eve did not bring joy.
"I was crazy about my husband and the kids," recalls a heavy moment in the six-week division of a four-year-old mother.
She also considered signing a reverse with her husband, including due to the inadvertent approach of one of the doctors.
In the end, however, it did not happen, and the doctors left Eva and her twins home.
The events of four pregnancy and childbirths sends CT1 on Tuesday evening at 21:45 hours.
A whole number of families can be reduced.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to cope with the electric twins and cut conditions.
The house didn't grow, but yours made Eve happy by installing a gas cook to make food for six people more comfortable.
If it's bad, we'll take care of the cab.
Eva is convinced that children are especially interested in family recreation and a pleasant atmosphere, not in size or in the size of the home.
For the time being, we've had a very good time, better than we've been waiting.
Although the disorder is worse hidden in a small space and the culling minima sometimes exceeds, but at least we're all close to each other, she smiles at Eva, who can find a positive page on every situation.
Vask's work as a lighting lamp in the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why he sometimes goes to Prague streets as a taxi driver.
In his 60 years, according to his words, care for family finances and children physically manages how long will it be?
"I realize that given our age difference, it will be me once who will live this family," Eva admits at the same time as asking for the future.
She'd like to go back to work, but she's more comfortable with her own business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly the same as the employer.
And if it's worse, we can take a cab with our husband, he's a nice blonde.
Apple's got no effect.
For everything, there's a display.
The most efficient processor, a camera with a greater resolution, a stronger range or display recognizing the strength of the touch, are in short preference to the nine-generation iPhones recently introduced.
The last two have also a negative impact on the size and weight of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The current trend of Apple was that every new generation of iPhone is easier than the previous one.
An exception were only a third and a fourth generation, which had slightly increased its weight against the previous iPhones.
The two-gram mass difference in the failures of the news was, however, truly negligible.
However, new iPhones don't pay far.
In contrast to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, weight grew in a smaller model of 14 grams, in a larger one of 20 grams.
On one side you can't be surprised, the last affair by bending in Apple's pockets suffered significantly.
The piece of news is thus made of a stronger clay sledge, 7000, which was also found to be of weight.
But there's a lot more impact on her than there is.
Apple used 3D Touch technology in the news, as the display recognises the strength of touch.
To this end, it was necessary to monitor another level of capacity sensors.
The importance of new iPhone displays has increased more than twice over the previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone of initially 12 grams per 29 grams, in case of greater than 19 grams per 40 grams.
In iPhone 6s, the display is the most difficult component used.
The weight of only 143 grams was then reached in this news also due to the evaporative skin that affected most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, then, the most difficult element used is the battery, but its weight has not changed in any way against the predecessor.
Even in this case, the largest growth is just at the display.
Weight 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
As far as the new technology will be practical, it will appear when used.
The first users will be able to test it on Friday, 25 September, when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will begin in the selected countries.
They've been eating champs for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglici, archaeologists have succeeded in finding an interesting possibility.
They found traces of the settlement of modern people from different times, including painted paintings, the rest of the tools, and so on and so on.
In the 23A layer, which is according to the tools given to about 30 thousand years ago, the scientists found something that very much resembles the rest of the breakfast buffet.
On the spot, there were traces of beef grains, which apparently passed through the production process today of such popular fibers.
With it, the seeds are first weeded, then dried, ridded of the package, called pulch, then burned and dissolved.
In the cave of Paglicci it was possible to discover the grain that had been burned or burned, and then apparently torn between two millstones - at least this suggests the rates of use on two rocks in the cave.
Thus, scientists have not been able to prove in their publication that in the cave, the whole process of the production of the cell was carried out, but the similarity is really very imaginary.
We also don't have any evidence of how people were able to eat fibers, but the idea that it was with some fluid and perhaps even heat, of course, is quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting document of how intensively people used crops long before farming.
Therefore, if the platoon interpretation is correct, the oldest platoons took place in agriculture for about 20 thousand years.
New report of stations in the Transport Company of Brna.
So once again, I listened to the report of the trolleybus station's names: Hnusáčkova, Priazak, Frazova, Spretecka.
Of course, trolleybus was somewhat louder, so reporting to the male voice was somewhat less understandable than before when the stops reported to the female voice.
Women's voice is higher, so in deeper traffic noise, it's more recognizable than a deeper male voice.
The DPMB argues that these voters have chosen their own passengers - I don't know who didn't ask me, but they certainly have chosen from the studio recordings that were completely silent, which, of course, sounded quite different from that of the bus engine.
I've been living in Brno for a couple of decades, so I know the correct names of all these stops, so I don't need this report, but the foreigners who don't know Brno and for which these reports are intended above all, can be confused and can be at the end of where they went wrong, then say that the stop they were supposed to go to was not reported at all.
Perhaps this choice of loudspeakers - but better loudspeakers - should be made again, and this time colored with normal transport noise and engine billing, in which the player's kiss on the bus is almost lost.
In order not to continue to listen to the names of the stations of Water Herspice, Šmírova, or then Ponorna in the craging country to which I moved in Komárova.
I guess my old ear didn't get worse all of a sudden during the only day that the voter changed the stop.
I understood that statement quite well the other day.
Good morning, co-maintainer.
From the tape recorders.
Today, few people know what the biggest and most intelligent governments were in the so-called complex checks.
I let myself remember that.
The bus was late.
I shot at the dispatcher's office at a time when the radio said it was just seven hours.
"You're lucky that you didn't meet with your boss, came a minute before you, and it seems like he's not in a mood," said the speaker, while I was writing in the book of income.
Thank you, I'll watch you.
Write to me that I'm going to check out a little mechanization.
It's not going to work, it's checking today.
They're all out of this shit until they're scared.
What's it really about?
"But you'll see," said the dispatcher.
You'll be next.
I ran for a walk.
Then the chief's door opened and the chief appeared.
Stirred, with a stone face, in a perfectly falling stench.
"Good morning, Mr. Chief," I greeted him politely, and he quickly turned on two buttons of the same suit.
"Good morning," the answer sounded, and I quickly ran out to the second floor, without realizing the cold, vicious tone that the old man responded to.
"You're playing," I was greeted by the engineer Eva, the elderly lady I was very much interested in.
She was even the chief before her partner sat down.
They're checks, and you're gonna get there.
I've asked myself how many times these complex checks are, but nobody wants to talk about it.
They're only three years old, they all have to be with them, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
But I'll see.
I pulled out of the column a folder with regular reports and then a phone.
"This is Holcman, come to me now," the chief called out.
What's bothering you?
Now we've met and nothing..." I've been missing, but no one answered, everyone with their thoughts.
"Good afternoon, comrade of the chief, I came to your order," I said, "I entered the chief's office.
The chief was sitting behind the writing table and looking at some ladder.
"The manipulator's wife," he said after a while without raising his head and still looking carefully at the left, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the left-hand on the table, took the chair and looked at me with a simple, unpleasant, evil, pimply look.
I've lost it.
What's going on?
Last night, he praised me for having worked very well for the past few months and for being very happy with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the corner at a distance.
And now this?
They realize you're a track distance technique and you have to behave accordingly.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I've been pampered that I've been using such a greeting since I was a child, that I've been so raised, and that I don't see anything wrong with it.
It was like a red hat on a crocan.
"You're on a socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is an honor to work," the chief said.
And besides, you're still messing with the nicknames of the overcrowded.
One time you'll say, "Lord," and then you'll say, "Sunny."
But I'm not a boss for you. I'm a fellow chief.
The tenants are partners of the tenants, the top roadmasters are partners of the top roadmasters!
Remember that kindly!
I'm sorry, sir... to the captain's companions, but... but I greeted you with a common civil greeting.
But there's nothing wrong with it... and it's an honor to work, or to have a partner... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your preference that you're not on the side," said a cold chief who calmed down a little.
But it's still going to happen.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a prepaid pension in this chair upstairs.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his priority, it didn't look good with the guy in question.
For a while, he was slapping me with a cold, heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-he-he-he-heh
I'm sorry about his high-end kicking, too.
He was only a few years older and played for the god, actually a fellow god.
It's a professional, adjective, an authoritarian, arrogant, as it was at the moment.
Everyone was looking for him.
Wake up, he's the chief.
Actually, not everyone, the president of the party organization, like all the parties, but also the non-citizens, was yelling at him.
But the chief pushed many, especially those with whom he could apply his superiority.
Right now he's got me for the whole cow.
I've been thinking about shit, and I've got enough moves to keep me from shooting it in his face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the pumpkin, so I could continue to do the hairdresser.
What would I use two kids for?
And that's the set-up bar!
I was in trouble, but I was in control.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all you can go to so far," the chief finished the audience and began to look back in bed and looked up the ladder he had before in his hand.
In the middle of the 12th, they called me.
Everyone in the office was there already asking questions about and how, they said, yes, that it would be good.
Only Jožin was curious about how his habit was that we could not all leave because the work would have to be done by his fellow chief with his own faithful ones, and that he was not in danger.
The word "conspiracy" then emphasized, as if he knew what the old man was looking for me for this morning.
There was a nice meeting in the principal.
The Chief of Staff at their writing table and at the long advisory table of the other associates who were supposed to decide on my office or not.
Kádravák, President ROH, personal recorder, special-purpose rapporteur, something in a way contrary to the war, and the place, my boss.
And also the most important person, the president of the party organization.
I knew him from the strike.
A common trachea worker, slammed his thumbs or saw his throats.
But also an ex-boyfriend.
She was asked that once, there was no funny thing about him, a beautiful old man.
The bad languages said he went out to school in the seventh grade, didn't learn anything, didn't have anything.
And when the criminal was destroyed, he ended up at the cemetery.
Oh, my God, that's right, that's what it was!
The chief asked me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an inconspicuous scarf in my neck.
Kádravák has read a statement from the Civilian Committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, two kids and so on and so on.
So far it's good, I've been thinking, and I've been breathing a little better.
Then a statement from the party's street organization.
He copied the judgment from the civil committee, and he wrote the same person.
But then it came!
The relatives of the long-term members refused to submit themselves before the inspection committee and subsequently came out of the party, for health reasons.
The chief looked at me very carefully.
The chef noticed and stopped reading.
The chief said he should continue.
And it was just worse.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee, and there I was acquired as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I married and married, except for the National Committee, I also had a church.
I failed the trust of the party in the worst way.
That's why I was cut off from a number of her candidates.
But it didn't work!
I let both children get baptized, and even my mother, when she died, made a church funeral, although it was a former member of the party.
I'm giving all of this a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the chest was read, only the punching of the chief of the chest to the desk interrupted the busy silence.
Everyone looked at me in a clear light, and I wanted to be somewhere far away.
Then I kept repeating in my mind, "Communists - survivors, communists - survivors." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay in the caverns?
I could've repaired the escape without any broken checks.
But now?
The career of a hairdresser took her first place before she started.
Go back to the chat room?
I don't think that's going to work. I'm sure the chief will be out for an hour.
"Counsel, how did you check the discussed co-operative here?" interrupted the quiet chief with a question about the cadre.
Well, according to the previous employment budget.
Do you have him here?
It was obviously not too late.
On the cuttings of the pot, he was nervously waving as if he were being checked himself.
He snuck in and gave the chief a paper.
"Well," said the chief with a sign of veneration, which was often the presence of storms.
At first glance, he studied the industry, worked in the task mill as a locker, met the standard on an average of one hundred and twenty percent.
It's just a matter of fact.
From where did you take the verdict, mate?" he turned again to a coward who felt that it was beginning to turn against him and that he would not have to be a coward very soon.
This is where my partner gave it to me when she came in.
That's enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the corner of the hall," the blacksmith said.
And there's no warrants, he was kind of more than that, so I put him in the file.
"So, when you entered the technical function, you got this paper car," the chief said.
He was nervous and had no answer.
"It's okay, we're talking about it later," the chief closed the matter, and the chair obviously fell.
For the time being, it's settled.
"So what about you, mate?" the chief turned to me again.
I'm out of here all of a sudden, so it's over!
In my eyes, it's dark, it's hot.
He followed the course of prosecutions and accusations, and I knew that I was the most reprehensible creature in the world who did not deserve the slightest pity.
That by stressing the incomplete decision I made in the error of the coder's associate, and I didn't understand why the decision was incomplete when I got it from the coder at the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist living that, at the time of building real socialism, supports the era of religious darkness, ba, even participating in them.
That there was a lot of that I did, or maybe I was still doing it, and I prayed for peace to end it.
I don't care.
I don't care if I get out of the mechanic's office.
I don't care if they take the potato.
It's a job for honest and decent people, not for enemies of the people I was in the eyes of the chief's associate.
"So it would suffice, comrade of the chief," suddenly the president of the party and severely interrupted the chief of the Levites.
This is where the associate made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he just did the stupid thing!
But he's already got his sentence!
Don't forget that, captain's partner!
What could be worse for a young man than we shut his door to the side for a while!
To open him up again, he'll have to prove that he's changed that it's an hour of our trust.
An untrained baker spoke like a book.
Where did she get it?
Is he so sumptuous or pampered with a phrase from a party school and a meeting?
That's why this young fellow must also get a chance from us!
The chance to prove he's changed.
And who's gonna give it to him unless you're the boss's partner?
It's your duty to support this young, right, a bit of a beloved companion in his efforts to repair!
It's your side duty that no one's gonna get rid of you!
Actually, it's a side duty for all of us, too.
This is where the partner must see that the party hasn't forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, not only does she punish, but she also loves.
When the president's finished, no one even listened.
No one's ever expected such a turn of events.
At least me.
"Just as I agree with you, my colleague, the president," the chief in an effort to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me make a deal, you'd hear that I was heading to that conclusion.
All agreed, but it was clear to them that he did not believe a word.
"That's how I was confirmed for the function of an individual reference to basic funds," I rushed back to the office and broke down.
Except for Evy engineers, they were all at lunch.
The silences listened to my independent imitation of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I'm done, she asked me if I could get some coffee.
Without waiting for the answer, she put water on the cook and caught the mushrooms.
In the meantime, she was discussing the cadron practices.
As one judgment, often full of praise, they give a man into his hand, and the other one, in which there is some dirt, will send a new employee.
But I didn't end up where I was, but at the end of the trailer, and so the company didn't know where they were supposed to send it.
What about our drawer?
The guy's just getting old where he'd eat or drink, and then it finally happened.
"He's been hiding from the old man," she said.
I'm sure he won't taste it today.
Take care of him anyway, he's pretty good.
And the party president?
Basically, a far worse chief, no crowd.
Zero from a potato with a lot of power.
The water for the coffee started to boil and the office filled the pot with freshly baked coffee.
I put sugar in the oven, and the dogs mixed a hot leukemia.
I hope I'm out of the worst.
Now it's not gonna work out for me, and the other checks are only in three years.
Anyway, I don't think that's how I'm gonna forget today.
Anthology of LITERATIA ON TRATI II in the EPIKA loading facility
The symbol of the alien has come to life.
The windmill over Chlum is running again after years.
It's seen far away because it's located at 15 meters high.
People in a wide area call him "the wind on the Chlum."
For the population of 150, it became even one of the elements of the general sign that the population gained the opportunity to meet relatives in 2010.
"We then asked for a sign and the wind on the sign, of course we wanted to have, everyone knows it," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlumsian wind pump is a local technical memory.
It is also a bit of a present: it reminds us of the time when the present people fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chluma in the past century was rare.
By 1910, the hummingbirds were decided on a solution that was then up to the mid - 80s.
In the village of Chichov, they let out seven meters deep.
Three years later, the cold was added to the steel structure with a wind pump, which poured water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village near the left church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranic on Moravia with 2,400 crowns," notes the memorial inscription on the ground floor of the construction of the barn.
After several repairs and windmills, it served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the water struggle began to be written: that day in Chlumu began to serve a new watercourse.
The wind pump has already remained only a non-functional general symbol and the current rarity.
The Dominant was fired at the family meeting this year.
By 2008, Chlumšti decided that the wind cycle would be restored and reinitiated.
They left to produce a replica of the original wheel - reduced by half a metre.
The bike was hit in the yard, but it had to be pulled down the same year.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose the suitable material and the wheel should not break the winds.
Then the Chlumsian dominant rested for several years under the roof.
Since June, however, the wheel on the high tower has been running again.
On the occasion of the encounter, the twins left a replica of the wheel to be adjusted and again seated on the top of the railway tower.
But the wheel is pumping the drinking water from the cold only to the western blind shoulder.
And over the summer, we completely disconnected him because there was little water in the barn.
At least it was empty.
"In the afternoon, the windmill from the pumpkin in the bag we will relax again," explained old Mašek.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic where the wind cycle to the general sign is the only one of this species in the entire Highland.
They have a similar element in the mark to honor local technical memories, for example in Chvalkovići and Green Mountains in Viškovska, in Kuželová in Hodoninsk, Partutovici in Prerovsk or in Police in Vsetinsk.
Nothing wrong, but Lafata didn't know, admitted the opposition to Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the fight against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone in my career," the 34-year-old Goian smiled at the prefabricated press conference.
This time George Hagi trained us, it was a shame we lost.
I hope I'm going to go to Sparta now.
Just the difference that we don't lose this time," Goian continued.
This man, who played 60 matches for Romanian representation, is the key force of the Greek team.
As a stoper, he's going to face the thrusts of the Sgt. offensive.
A few thousand people come, no hell, says about the Greek battle, Sgt. Hybsh.
And partly knows what can wait for him Thursday night.
I know Fatia, who played in Romanian asterisk with my brother Lucian.
I saw all their matches back then.
I know he's a very good attacker, so he went to Sparta, too, said Goian.
The other footballers of the Prague club didn't mention, so the direct question came, if he also knew David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech league and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled, and with a light computational look he looked at the Czech press.
The faceless expression meant, "Why are you asking me this?"
Just a little while ago.
We saw some videos and I noticed Sparta playing a lot of teams.
He's got really good players.
What about Lafata?
Nothing bad, but I don't know anyone else but Fatia.
The cook knows very well about Goian.
"My experience from larger clubs, it can be said that they hold the defense of Asteras, it's such their game organizer," said Stanislav Hajkal, the peer assistant.
Goian has had the best years of his life, but he can enjoy a very interesting football biography.
He was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both the United and City Manchester, from Steauy, but he was also heading for the Italian Palermo, playing for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, the coach says.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing European competitions, steaming about victory in the Czech league.
For me, it's a favorite match, but we're playing at home and we want to start the team with a good result.
Just like Sparta, we'll try to win, Goian said.
I'm in peace with the Slovenian barber Tomáš Košický, who is very excited about the match from Czech Republic.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're gonna fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new residence should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trade with shares of the company at the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have a group seat in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken in the context of the project are mostly legal and administrative and do not have a real impact on action in society, says Daniel Buryš, financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In relation to the move of the group's seat, shareholders consider the placement of shares at the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry into the Prague Stock Exchange, the company completes the prospectus of the securities that will be submitted to the Czech National Bank for approval as soon as possible.
The transfer of holding seats and related transfers of shares will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction by only participating in the existing shareholders.
Therefore, no public registration or new investors will be offered in the framework of this operation.
"A possible offer of action to new investors would be made - if the company so shrinks and its shareholders decide - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016," the company said.
In the past, the company has already stated that any offer of shares could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of actions to the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including placement of actions to the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
The objective test of Czech television in information about the migration crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of the reporting of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time, the broadcast of the Czech TV's main news report.
How did she get there?
When journalists are taught at the Faculty of Journalists how the media can manipulate reality, they can leave today's broadcasts of the Czech TV Event.
The migration crisis has been attributed to about 80% of the reporting.
Until the first minute, when CT informed of the disturbances at the Serbian-Madjerian border and the attacks of migrants on the police, Eufemistics called them patience - thrown stones and attacked with metal fists), the now promigrating propaganda - was already eating - judge for yourself the names of the individual reports.
The criticism of non-governmental organisations - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticise the poor treatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - story of the integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
I'm not only as a threat, but as a chance.
Travel of refugees - CT consistently uses the expressions of runners or fugitives and not migrants.
It is particularly impressive that the CT uses in illustrative recordings only as a result and only pictures for young children and women.
In the same broadcast, however, she stated that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: Most of the propaganda that does not have a period of communist agits.
I have to say I'm ashamed to be a former journalist.
Ecology in practice.
When I woke up in a panel apartment, I soon stopped being the only resident.
I've been moved to a boarding school by fishermen.
The fish from the house, the wet with the change is not perfect, i.e., that does not produce the transfer from the shell to the brooch and the young look like an adult, it's just tiny and gradually growing.
They were against me, and I didn't want to lose them.
First by hand and then by chemical.
Socialist drugs at their disposal provided some kind of blue crystals.
I think it was called Cyclon B.
Or something else?
But it was successfully eliminated.
Later, I dealt with the Pharaoh in a similar way.
The box with some juvenalizer that the ants brought into the nest and then he did not allow the queen to generate a new offspring.
But I turned it down.
As time went on, he also became an object of my pride, and I became increasingly inclined to the view that they had the same right to life as we do.
In addition, I have learned from my life that interference with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one disaster can replace another.
I don't think I'd be able to get rid of the truth by killing them.
In our new home, we agreed with our partner that if we don't get fish to go for a ride, we'll eat some of those invisibilitys, and so on.
Their peaceful existence has been disrupted by a spider after a while.
It was a common kind of passenger who had been sitting on the roof for a long time.
We thought he was living with occasional males and mosquitoes, which just increased our comfort.
Because he lived with us for several years, we found that he was living mainly for fishermen and that he evidently kept their numbers in a profitable calculation.
With a reliable regular contact, we found out that she was a female.
So we were witnesses of romantic encounters with a partner about a third less than a third, as a careful brute on the spider's fibers, so he wouldn't be eaten before he could reach the extracted dome.
It lasted about three days when they didn't move and respond to our controls.
Under the toilet table, where the loving toys were played, we found the remains of a dried female next to the female.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was already behind us, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging around her.
They're gone soon.
For the sake of the sake of the mother, for the sake of the rest of the people.
Even a female went missing after a week.
If she left or fell asleep, we don't know, but after a month, two, she showed up on the roof again.
The truth is, about something smaller, it's probably the daughter of those bathrooms.
For some time, she carefully observed our behavior, and by moving under the toilet, she assessed our non-attack as friendship.
The figure of some planted fish was reduced again, and the spider looked at its usual activities in order to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed all year.
Our daughter grew up among them when the use of the night was already a shame.
We've tolerated it so far, but we've already been fed by the ever-lasting extraction of its contents.
We urged her to use the bathroom even more.
However, the daughter found an excuse for maintaining her wrongdoing in the spider that she had seen very well when she was tormenting.
Our talk about seeing spiders didn't even take the luck of the house.
With tears and tears, she had her night out.
There wasn't any leftovers.
There's a time when the spider had to report to the daughter's development movement.
It was on me.
He was taken to the glass and thrown over the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I've been messing with him like a friend, but I've been feeling ugly for as long as I've been trying to get away with my family.
We assumed that the fish would start to appear more often and multiply in a geometric order.
The world's strange, the week, the two, there's no one in there.
I started to speculate about the reason.
It seemed to me that if the spider didn't grow up there in the form of an antlers, it wasn't as positive for the environment of the toilet as we thought it would be.
But then the first pieces of the middle size appeared, and they're already boiling again.
I had to figure out another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their connection to the spider had to have the reason that if they didn't see him, he was hidden somewhere else and that they were threatened from anywhere.
Or, perhaps they had some telepathic connection with their predator and his rapid disappearance caused some frightening reaction.
I don't think I'm making any illusions about theirs.
Some kind of light showed cowardice, but that they would respond to hand-mowing or fast movement, no.
The daughter's going to the bathroom all the time.
I think she's forgotten about the night.
There's only one thing left to bring back some spider.
I'm already sending my wishes to the ether, and I hope they didn't hurt me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use the B-cycle.
The disaster of Albert Einstein, who enriched the world.
The years of the brilliant scientist of the past century are likely to never cease to fascinate mankind.
He managed to sink into everything so deep that the outcome was always an amazing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
In particular, people have come to know their special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic state.
It cannot also be mentioned its explanation of the photo effect or the idea of quantifying the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the very description and the system of knowledge of popular relativity theory is so plurished that for a closer meeting, they prefer to choose easy occasions.
It's not easy, though.
However, it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find this brilliantly simplified form of explanation: The clock near your lover seems to be a minute; a minute in the hot oven seems to be an hour - and that is relative.
I've allowed myself to choose from his entire placard of famous quotes these ten that have literally caught me.
Smart people are trying to solve problems, genius is trying not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about that first one.
No amount of temptation can ever prove that I was right.
But the only time he can prove that I was wrong.
But it's a sad period when it's easier to break those than to destroy prejudices.
Is there an irregularity on the table reflecting an irregularity in mind, what then reflects an empty table?
I don't know what he's going to fight in World War Three, but in the fourth, it's gonna be claws and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect him.
Knowing a little is dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to deal with the problem that would depend on my life, I'd spend 40 minutes of his study, 15 minutes of his analysis and 5 minutes of his solution.
The most difficult thing in the world to understand income tax.
Finally, I can't let Einstein know the formula for the definition of success: If we take A for success, the pattern is A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is holding the language for the teeth.
New and modern.
Insects in Zlinsk are waiting for changes of 1.5 billion.
"It is a success when we consider that all four are kept in black numbers all this year," hehtman Stanislav Mishák said.
The total cost of national facilities is currently about 32 million crowns.
The share is mainly higher than insurance, which is equally favourable for this year.
And this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally allow more investment.
In Croměříží, Vsetín, Uherska Gardena and Zlína, this leads to buildings that will total nearly 1.5 billion crowns.
It's been a long time since we bought the main equipment, it's over.
Now we need to start building new buildings, because without them, no peak health can be done, the plans of the country's health substitute Lubomir Nezem.
He's looking forward to changes in all hospitals.
Construction workers are coming to the hospital next year.
In the Ossetia, the suppliers of the new internal pavilion are now selecting nearly 300 million crowns.
There is a planned port of dialysis in the Crossroads.
The Uher Garden wants to add a new interior for about 200 million to the open central pavilion this year.
And an evil Bata's hospital is waiting for a long-retired new central income building and an internal facility that will need three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, it is a key and often biggest change in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," for example, told the construction of the hospital director of Věra Prousková.
The five-storey building is to be ready for about two years and offers comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, bed and intensive care unit.
More comfort for patients.
Changes, which are particularly familiar to patients, will affect all regions.
For example, new buildings will replace those in which many of the sick are lying in one room, on the floor only one toilet, beds are inconvenient, windows are uncomfortable, and health professionals do not have adequate working conditions.
"For example, our interior was built fifty years ago and now it's on the edge of its life," said the director of Pavel Calábek Hospital.
For a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-way modern building connected to an emergency reception.
Doctors and patients will have all the emergency departments in one place, as well as in new areas.
The same model already has half of the ready Uher Garden.
Central revenue is already in place and will be added to it within three years.
"We will pay for the building from credit and partly from our own resources," explained Director Petr Sladek.
Just this hospital can afford its own funding as the only one in the country.
The profit is still the highest, and it has not even been lost two years ago, when the evil hospital had to deal with almost two hundred million losses.
"We have good insurance contracts, excellent performance, revenue and cost management across the hospital effectively," Vlastimil Vajdák, who has a care economy, said.
The improvement is also expected in patients in the cross-sectional hospital.
Over ten to fifteen years it will go to repair, new equipment and reconstruction up to half a billion crowns.
By this year, the plant will be ready to fix the catchment station, then start the building of dialysis, if necessary, for a new magnetic resonance.

No one told me how to keep accepted refugees in the country if they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Cavanec (ČSSD) complains to his European colleagues that the other countries of the Czech Republic are pushing for a quota to redeploy refugees, but any discussion is refused.
It also suggests that no one has yet explained to him how to keep assigned refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us.
"We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe in more specific terms the position that you have come to discuss ministers inside and abroad the European Union?
We don't agree with mandatory quotas like a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migrants like salt or flour.
They're living creatures that have some vision, some direction, some relative.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we could keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were to redistribution.
We can't imagine.
We did not get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, the African country trust fund and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about it for a year and we've been saying this is the way.
But to say that the quotas will solve everything?
We've solved forty thousand recently, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in this area?
Ninety-eight percent of all the people who cross us want to go to Germany.
We don't want anyone here, we just don't know how to keep them here.
The ambitions of other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as their target country are gaining asylum with us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, that is, Syria and other countries, is limited to zero.
You mentioned that refugees don't really want us, but fifteen people have already made a commitment.
Wouldn't it be possible to accept them this way more?
We made a commitment to accept 1500 people, but on condition.
We said functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even in the 1500s, it's about 1100 people we're dealing with will come.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same way we've caught them.
It is a big question, and we will discuss it with Europe if we can keep people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, possibly in Hungary.
Because Europe is acting in such a way that if they have registration, they cannot be detained.
That means they'll come to our territory with registration, and if there's a deal that's not yet, it can happen that we won't even hold those 1100 in the territory of the Czech Republic and they'll go back to Germany once they get here.
If we can keep them in place after the asylum proceedings, we will arrange an asylum procedure with them.
If this is the case for Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 per cent of European statistics provide international protection.
Then they will get the documents that will enable them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people will end up in target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will move in.
This is the second project that has been taking place so far, and there we have just advanced in that we are discussing with the churches the possibility that they might be able to help them get employment, housing and so on.
But it's a very long run.
You said that the other States were not willing to discuss with us at the ministerial meeting.
But is it not that the Czech Republic only rejects quotas, but does it not offer any solidarity step that would block this debate?
And exactly what kind of solidarity is that supposed to be?
If the Federal Republic of Germany calls for all migrants from Syria to be able to do so, the report will spread in an hour after all camps throughout Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's going to be another migration wave that's heading to Germany, because they just don't want us to.
We believe that the road is the protection of external borders - just the migration waves to rehabilitate, help the necessary ones, and separate economic migrants.
It's obvious that they don't have a chance.
Only a year ago, 50 thousand Kosovos came to Germany.
From secure Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, state representations.
If we managed to separate them and not accept them or accept them only as needed by the economy, then those fifty percent of what today's social systems are spending on could go to refugees.
On the contrary, the first day that Germany took control, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
Where does it come from to further deepen border controls?
We were afraid of arrest in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have a few hundred free seats in stone arrest facilities.
Of course, all the people we hold will be returning to Austria within seven days.
We're doing it by default.
They are the only people who take us, it's complicated with Hungary and the Greeks - it's a completely unnecessary story.
So where's the point of a break?
Should it be a thousand a day?
I think it's supposed to be a few hundred days.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three days a day, we're running out of capacity so that there's a crisis plan.
Then I agreed with your Prime Minister that he would call the extraordinary government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're on the phone several times a day.
If this is the case, the government may sit de facto immediately and decide by one resolution to strengthen the army police, let's give it a customs administration, possibly the prison service.
The country variant is an exceptional position that has now been declared in some places in Hungary?
I don't think it can come this far.
Be aware that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have a Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen for this to happen in the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread scary information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, is more likely to suggest that the Hungarians will try to remove the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct road to Austria.
The Czech Republic would have touched it very deeply, almost at all.
Slavia has paid a lot of debts for the last minute.
It's trying to prevent a breakdown.
Soccer Slavia paid the debts.
The footballers were waiting for their money.
Soccer Slavia stayed on Tuesday for the first time due to insolvency proceedings before the court.
Almost three months after about 20 million crowns were awarded to her, she proposed Online Services from Pacific Samoa.
The legal representative of Slavia Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzlov for several hours that he was not supposed to report a fall on Slavia.
And it has to be said that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week, with the new owner of Slavia, a large Chinese industrial and investment group of CEFC and the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimaní.
Obviously, from the new owners to the club, they've made money, and for the last time.
This also proves the statement of glory before Tuesday's trial - the top club on Monday, only the day before the trial, he sent tens of millions of crowns.
"All was paid between September 11th and September 15th," the legal representative of Slavia Mládková said.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
For example, the Slovenian ex-representative of Milan Ivan or the Czech hostage, Mari Lick.
Slavia also paid agent Alexandr Losenicke a fee.
On Friday, the club also paid the due fees of the city of Prague 10.
The part of the insolvency dispute thus remains de facto only the claims that Slavia is disposing of.
According to the club, the commitments were not made at all, or they were dealt with in court.
However, we are prepared to pay for the losses of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds on the bank account, which we can report from the account," lawyer Mládková told the judge.
"All that has been paid is paid," Mádková said and added that the unpaid are only unpaid or disbursed commitments.
It is also true that the judge will not decide in the next few days and that the trial will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid the above debts.
The result is an evaluation of all the evidence.
The decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The judge ordered further proceedings on November 3rd.
However, the decision will not go to this meeting, but in writing.

FastMig X is the most recent generation of inverter coating sources.
The combination of peak technologies, hardware and software equipment integrated into the modular design brings benefits and rapid return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final composition is always configured according to customer requirements.
And anything, from the heating of construction steel after the heating of special slurry, as well as from the heating of rough materials after the heating of thin plates, from the application in the shops to the heating of the vessels.
The incredible amount of contaminants, the simple setting and the expansion of the contaminant source enables a rapid response to change requirements, leading to a reduction of the simples, to the need to stop the source and to a more productive contaminant.
FastMig X enables heating with peak heating processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and heating quality.
It ceases to waste time and does not allow the material or the correction of the flaws.
It provides flexibility, is less simple, more heating and higher profit.
It's this year's news that she had a premiere in Nitra, where she also won gold medals.
We appreciate these points because they confirm the product's exceptionality.
The world's leading manufacturers can boast similar systems, but thanks to the differences in software and the parameters of FastMig X to the world's peak.
For the interested parties, it is certainly pleasant and additional time-limits that are moving around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already linked the first contacts that will certainly be extended after the Brno Fair.
We have been his regular participants for more than 20 years and almost always follow him our trade results better than before, stresses for the company ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, the leading salesman of Kemppi in Plzni.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final composition is always configured according to customer requirements.
It went to build a blank so that it wouldn't break.
But it would be half a billion more, says an expert from the company who designed the tunnel.
The white went even safer, the expert says.
The tunnel complex Blanka was able to build so as not to cause two land failures in Prague's Stromovce, the firm's CEO of Satra, who is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovic.
He said it on Wednesday afternoon at a news tour of the tunnel.
But according to him, it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
The drivers will be open on Saturday afternoon.
It is always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel was going to run safer, but the costs are rising exponentially," Butovic said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovce have been the same all the time, although the country has only a few steps away from where it began to develop a safer and more cautious approach.
"If these measures were used 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion miles thicker," Butovic said.
The White Tunnel fell three times during the building.
Twice, in 2008, a charter was created in Stromovce, in 2010 the land fell to the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of the company Metrostast Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is extremely expensive, said the Euro weekly.
According to the original intention, the building was to make 17 billion crowns.
When we add the VAT that went out twice during the building, you have eleven billion.
When it comes to technology, land purchases and engineering, valuation and similar items, it's 29 billion, which isn't from the 37 again so far, the Whitelov said.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.

Zisky FedExu mixed, reducing fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx has reported unsatisfied results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in the forecast of total profits due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the land division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers on holidays.
The company's share decreased by about 2.5 per cent in pre-market trade 45 minutes before the mid-term opening.
FedEx states that it expects a profit between $10,40 and $10,90 for the fiscal year, which ends next May, which means a 20-cent reduction from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey carried out by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an increase in interest rates of 4.9 per cent, which is shown in January. 4, and higher supplements for land transportation of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company stated that it was still expected to increase profits against the previous year due to lowering costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
The Chairman of the Representation and Director-General of Fred Smith said that the company "prepared a strong performance despite the expected economic conditions, particularly in the processing industry and global trade."
The holiday rental plans were announced the day after the rival UPS stated that the plan should also hire 90,000 to 95,000 employees, which is probably the same as last year's hire.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx won $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The profit for the action was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 for the action, which was predicted by 12 analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
Markets increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts from Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been affected in recent years by a reduction in priority international shipping, which has led to the stagnation of revenue in its express unit.
But boom in online shopping increased the results of the FedEx Earth Unit.
In the last quarter, land income grew by 29 per cent, but operating profit was essentially the same for higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates, while the profit decreased in the freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In the pre-market business about an hour before opening the FedEx share decreased by $3.85, or by 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decrease of 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent under the June 11 record.
At its most unexpected meeting over the years, the federal reserve legislator spends two days this week at 27 cents of the long Hong Kong table and will decide whether it is time to increase the key interest rate after almost ten years.
With regard to them at one end of the central bank's ornamentation, the two-story sitting room will be painted by the United States.
The map is a reminder that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are going to give economic interests to the people over all the others.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: to maximize US employment and maintain the current prices stable.
But since the Great recession, the Feds have recognized that there is an unwritten third functional period: financial stability.
And this third functional period could be an X-factor too close to the preliminary decision to be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to drop off in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates since the end of 2008.
Although most data show strong economic growth, recent turbulence in world financial markets could already scare the careful Fed by adding to instability by increasing its reference rate of federal funds - and nothing more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour and inflation market will be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Pegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that they were just looking for a compromise to increase the level, increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient reason to keep waiting," she said.
There is no consensus on what Fed will do, which is why he is nervous about himself in financial markets.
Approximately half of the economies recently questioned by Blomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to keep the issue, with the key indicator only about 30% of the chance to increase.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market in case the Fed increases the rates, only if the policy declines dramatically by stating that further increases are not respected.
In Tuesday's industrial average, Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, on 16 599.85.
The meeting was triggered by the expectation that Fed's policy will keep the rates calm this week, says John Lonski, the leading economist in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if Fed were to raise the rates now," he says.
If Fed had done so, "they would have to go to the extreme in their programme statement and hold the hands of the financial markets in order to avoid panic."
Other experts claimed that the increase in rates would calm the financial markets, because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would act.
Only a month ago it seemed that Fed was on a good road to an increase of 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in the slow strengthening of currency conditions that would confirm the strength of economic recovery in the United States.
Yelle said that over the spring and early years, it is expected to increase tariffs this year and through the complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the labour market this year saw strong growth.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, which is lower in more than seven years and is close to the level that Fed considers to be full employment.
The wage profits showed signs of recovery.
And even though inflation continues to be under the target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed policy argues that for the main reason it was a temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
Economics "can be balanced with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the leading economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets all over the world began to decline at the end of the last month after China dwindled its currency.
The Dow Jones industry average dropped by 16% under its record value in May when investors feared that the Chinese economy would slow down global growth.
The market is somewhat reflected in this month, and Dow is now losing only about 10% of the maximum of May.
The unrest situation on the market adds a complex calculation to the political factors of Fed when it starts to increase the interest rate.
"By the absence of what has happened in the financial markets, and the reports on the weaknesses of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, it would be exacerbated at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, head researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now they expect to wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about how this will affect the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest development in China," Oliner said.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the main interests of Fed, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, Fed became the world's currency authority.
The impact of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The clear sign of the then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that Fed could "fowl" their monetary expansion on the market, set off the cracks all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, it can be expected that representatives of the Feds are monitoring developments elsewhere, but also working with other central bankers and experts so that they can better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the wealth management of Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "Fed has a history of movements in financial markets that seem independent of economic foundations."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee’s policy-making, who pressed for increased rates, cited the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points during the three sessions "I through limited identification effects on growth in the USA," Lacker said.
A year later, representatives of the Feds returned these scraps.
The Fed should prioritise financial stability concerns only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England's established rate committee.
The latest promise is not even approaching this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of growing interest, because markets have deteriorated," said Posen, president of the Peterson International Economy Institute.
The Federal Reserve System Act still has two mandates and does not affect financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should get to the point.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinese Quarter
The market/fund was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market which also sells for the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese quarter, not a Thai quarter.
The market/store is the only contact place that offers an amazing range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian decorations, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part available if you need some motor oil.
Trade is massive and it will take you an hour to get through all the streets.
If you have any of this buying hunger, go to food in LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading station (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has different collection locations.
What is in store: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and many items are sold in large.
Among fresh products are special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and others.
Mass enlargement is great, for example, fish - employees behind your desk wash and exhale, even sweeten it, if you want it,
The good part of the store is left with a massive freezing section where you will find frozen crayons of leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, cow's blood and garlic, pork, fish balls, regional sausages, free-traded semi-trailers and others.
Who buys here: Owners of restaurants and chefs, also single families and individuals.
Wide streets come up with shopping cars and high-speed vehicles.
Find: Christmas monthong durian next to the treasure stand.
Where is it: The store is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounds the suburbs of the Chinese quarter and center - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store may be busy, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the roads will stay with the old man.
The acceleration to 150 km/h of snow has been refused.
In the selected ranges it will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
In Tuesday she decided when she came to the amendment proposal of the Senate, which refused to increase her speed.
The news of the Earth Communications Act will now turn to the president.
President Milos Zeman already said at the end of April that the law would allow a foot-and-step speed of a kilometer.
Against the increase, the Minister of Transport Dan Čaok (for the UN), according to which the Czech road network has not yet been built at such a speed.
Even on Tuesday before the MP, he supported the Senate version of the law.
The approved new ones will now be able, in accordance with the original government proposal, to increase the speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour in the first class of the selected roads, in particular the four pipelines.
The snowflake first extended this option to the distance at which it would be possible to drive at selected speeds up to 150 km/h, but the Senate rejected it.
The envoys have now joined in on his proposal.
The senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport, also called for the transport police to have the last word in editing the local communications they are taking care of.
The Senate version approved by Sniemovna is also calculated to allow the sewerage, plumbing or public lighting cables to be stored side by side under the surface of the vehicle.
That's how the foreigners would save the land.
The municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the land in question.
Novela is also helping to improve the protection of the roads and to facilitate the provision of vehicles to which the owners do not report.
The new municipalities could sell detached vehicles that do not come within a six-month period after notification of the withdrawal of their owners.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight transport across their territories along the roads of the second and third classes under the threat of torture and for shipping companies.
Novela is also losing the opportunity to introduce electronic remote notes instead of today's papers, which will also be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
An oral expression goes before the court.
He's got 10 years to risk for the predestined welcome of the mayor.
The case concerns the alleged welcome project.
The police also wanted to challenge the case, but they didn't issue it.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both are at risk for up to ten years of imprisonment.
The main character is already planned for two October days.
According to state representative Mandík and Macík, at least one million crowns have caused damage, resulting from the complaint.
The complaint is based on an expert judgment.
The former members of the city’s management, according to the plaintiff’s title, unduly allowed the property benefit of the company that organised the welcome of the citizens.
Mandík, according to his complaint to the then head of the City Services, Education and Culture Master's Committee, filed a meeting with five companies in the selection process.
When another company that offered the lowest price was registered in the competition, the council cut down the competition.
The contract was then to entrust the city to the administrator and to the competition only the company Darothore, which was then awarded by the council of the city.
The city paid at least a million extra.
Both charges were directed to ensure for Darothore the award of a public order for the organisation of an event The greeting of the citizens in Ústí nad Labe long-term and coordinated at least in contradiction with the requirement for proper economic care, writes the state representative.
At the same time, he believed that Darothore was aware of the fact that, following the acquisition of this contract, Ústí nad Labe is counting on the execution of the Valuation of Prices, which will, in contrast to the real value of the services actually provided, be significantly increased.
In three years, according to the draft, more than five million crowns were recorded.
The city eventually paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, and then it retired from the contract.
The amount paid was at least one million crowns overrun, according to the notice.
Mandík already refused any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this built-in case, the former prime minister said before that the city under his command was just tying to a similar project from the past years.
In 2008-2010, the event was provided by Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, the same money," Mandík added.
The criminals wanted to accuse also Ambassador Kailov, who was also a council member of the city.
She was sent by a snowman, but she didn't make it to reach her.
Therefore, in her case, the criminals have dropped the charge, but they count on Kaill's charge after her MP's mandate is over.
The greeting of the parishioners was a social action that took place several times a year.
Her mother received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of children's needs and small gifts.
The Hungarian policemen reportedly left the refugee dog.
Then they got the reporters to wipe the record.
The Hungarian police arrested an AP cameraman on the border briefly and forced him to delete the record on which the police dog allegedly hit the refugee country.
The Hungarian government, however, doubts this accusation.
The alleged incident took place on Saturday night when the cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia across the cornfield near the Hungarian city of Röszke.
Against the refugees, the police marched and one of them let a certain Syrian attack a dog with a basket on a hook.
The dog of a man who yelled, "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," fell down, claimed Muzi.
The fact that Muzi is filming everything, he noticed one of the cops and didn't let him leave.
Then the reporter shouldn't have called his superior or his colleagues on the spot.
The Muzi police took him to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
The museum thus found the result of two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt at risk because they were near dogs.
The AP sent a protest letter to the Hungarian government of Zoltán Kovács.
The conduct of the police was unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not afraid that the government would destroy legally acquired material.
Kovacs, with a call to the police report of the Museum's trial, questioned the events.
He said the cops just wanted a reporter to show them if they were on some footage they had the right to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't bother him.
"The dogs can puke - they're trained to scare and push a little bit of fear, but they certainly didn't attack," Kovács says.
Unpredictable League of Masters.
Exhibit on the City will pick us up, believes Juventus
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserve to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, a visitor to the home city.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic game of the Masters League.
Not one team has created a lot of opportunities, but we had a ball on the corners for a long time.
"The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus just shot two beautiful balls," assessed Pellegrini's strike, whose team incassed in the competition after 636 minutes.
The finalist of the last Juventus season on it was exactly the same before the mutual clash - after the first three rounds of the Italian league has only one point and score 2:4 is up to the 16th place of the table.
And that's why the turn of the Etihad Stadium was a great surprise.
"This victory will psychologically help us, it will kill us," says Coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three resistances before the new year - Pirla, Téveze and Vidala.
In Manchester, they represented Pogba, Mangjukic and Morat.
"That's right, this victory is very important, so that we can find it on the winning wave," hopes Morata.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best men in Europe.
In the second half, we were better, especially at the attack phase.
This result is worth my players.
"Before our balance ball, we could have incassed at 0:2, but Gianluig supported us," the Allegri Golman Buffon said.
"We've burned several good odds," hated Yay Touro, Deputy City.
We need to get out of the League of Experience Masters and try a better outcome next time.
Good-bye, Angelo. Good-bye, old German II.
Before continuing to ask immigrants, we should realize that the whole media is being handled by professionals.
It's all about the media and the sister as well.
And that's how we're gonna stop for a while.
Today, newspapers and media are full of children who carry on their parents ’ hands after the dusty journeys of the Exodus.
And it calls for a person - that is, a European person - an automatic sense of guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't just come in here, you know, desperate kids, on the pictures of the docking boats on the Greek islands, that the baby isn't so much to see!
Well, we've been out of the last few hours on the television of a ship headed to Lampedus, refugees from the French border at Menton, with thousands of young men with beautiful walks.
Most of the young blacks.
And they also lost pictures of Callais, where these people are eating and black men are waiting to see if they can get through the tunnel under La Manche.
It probably doesn't work anymore.
Neither those pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans made any special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
Too much of it ran fake.
So when it comes to escape quotas, it's kind of a secret that it's not only about unhappy children from Syria, but also about the disabled - for older people: fashionably trained - young men.
Their muscles look like they just got out of a fitness center.
It's just one personal experience.
This summer in the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we were lying on the private beach of the hotel.
No matter how private she was, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no hams.
And out of them came a young black man.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all dressed in brand clothes and shoes, in hand, like otherwise, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, it was not interesting and employees - Turks, Muslims! - they were obviously afraid of them.
They planted all the beds.
Whoever didn't lie on it and was just in the sea, he had a bad temper.
They were dressed like American rapper film.
On the head of a hat with a nose, white and colorful adidas on your feet.
Then the local beach bar was suspended and they started swimming.
They sat the chairs around, they sat next to the breakfast and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children were showering from the dining room somewhere in peace.
Next black people drank beer even from a third - how in the USA series?! - they threw empty bottles around them on the beach.
They kept yelling at each other.
It wasn't English, though.
Then they went to drink wine, even out of the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in the brand-new swimming pools, especially those young ladies -, in the water barbers and screams, mothers with children and adults fled in fear, and in half an hour they were no longer on the beach or in the pool or no black guest.
Everyone's gone.
No matter whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel employees were afraid to talk about them.
The priest said to me in the evening, "Have you seen the gold they had on themselves?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," said the officer.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had on his neck about 20 centimeters of gold massive cross.
And the women were like gold.
"These are drug feeders?" I asked.
"You've seen them drink," the clerk said.
Drugs don't eat, they don't even live.
They're doing something completely different.
So it was clear to me what they were eating.
However, in June 2105, it wasn't important to me yet.
I didn't know what was going to happen.
But secret services and top politicians should know it first.
I don't think they'd know.
About 1.5 million immigrants were released to Europe at that time.
And they go and go and go.
Today it has been shown that the main problem of the European Union is that total-political-correct policies, like intellectuals and their binding lobbyist and economically important groups have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its policies - now publicly recognised as the main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only they, as well as EU and television spots, including ours.
For example, recent television images of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are on the level of images of Moscow's television from August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sunflowers at the station, but mostly - old Germans - Muslims welcomed their fellowmen.
For many weeks, reports on Czech television have baffled as if they were Germans, according to some research, almost all for the arrival of immigrants.
However, who was only a few days in Germany, knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms further information.
For example, a famous public opinion research organised by the Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Republic of Poland.
According to the ARD claim, more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept more refugees a week ago.
That's what our TVs reported.
However, what happened the second day went by in Germany: the polling showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want immigrants - the polls involved 67,000 people.
It is true that the Merkel office publicly in November 2010, five years ago, declared: "Our effort on multicultural society has completely failed."
And then she said, "Germany gives up the fight for multicultural society."
"Every effort has been made to make such a solution completely successful."
In a country where four million Muslims live, according to it, a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live by themselves without being integrated.
But it's not a reality.
The multicultural approach, when we say we're just living happily by ourselves, has failed this approach.
He just made a mistake.
But neither Merkel has the power to go against the powerful Germany and Europe and, above all, against political justice.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is rising rapidly.
Euronemec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, MP for the SPD, the only one who probably does not have a degree in the Europarliament - yes, that is what Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said he could play the supervisor in the concentration for a minute - as he has already done once again.
It seems, in particular, under the impression of the last sentences of German politicians, that Germany exceeded Rubikon.
Note that, until some, most European policies do not support these years, citizens of the countries that have been victims of Nazism are terrified.
What happened to Germany?
With those rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who have been trying, at least on the outside, to deal with their terrible past of the aggressor and the murder of millions?
Do they have the truth to say that in the soul of Germany, there is a devil of aggression, superiority and violence?
Did Officer Otto von Bismarck have the truth when he stopped his attempts to control the entire centre of Europe with all his might?
When did he say the big German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When they dropped her off, she started preparing for World War I.
The idea of Velkonemek, which led Germany and Europe into two wars that stood millions of lives, was likely to return in a different way.
After trying to control the state of Marxists, for example with the Rote Army Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, in Germany, for example, the ecology, which was, by the way, one of the main ideas of the Nazis, began to develop a new German ideology.
We'd say the sun.
The German elites have long defended the creation of German nationalism, and so left all those fighters against the atom in peace, the zeal that seeks paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi password Our forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people all over the world who want to do something different and better, they turned to the side of combatants against global warming, stopped nuclear power stations, etc.
And they forgot that in this stream there is also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called proalestin - and anti-Slovenian, all-Slovenian, which has been a major German nationalist since the time of Karl Marx.
And also, as the recent judgments of Schulze and the German minorities show, openly threatening the disobedient eastern states, the idea of the German leader.
Which is necessary without apologizing.
Otherwise you're in trouble!
And when we add that immigrants are a very influential group of volunteers, we have what we have.
And behind it stands as always capital, especially the German which it meets and which is because Germany actually controls most of Europe's states through banks and the Union.
The psalmist of the sunflowers first brought Germany into the bays of ecology and multiculturalism and brought them home today and perhaps even brought millions of Muslims.
Those who, angry voices siren, will soon come upon the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and they will start to storm.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbours with force, once again part of its population - but, as it seems, the smaller part - ideologically evil, but finally it is as always achieved.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim housing is on fire.
What will the German government do when the public protests of the Germans against the arrivals of the Islamists are broken?
Will Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time come to help, but certainly not assimilated to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalization of Muslims, the arrival of Islamists and the Germans, following the fear of Islamizing their country?
What will it do with Germany, and even with Germany, when people who will be loud and publicly protest against the new euro-sur-human Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict that has led to the support of solar ideologies in Europe, i.e. the ideologies of the elite and, in principle, the totality, and its unintended banks, is growing.
And because of the unfavourable attitude towards disobedient democratic Germans and all sub- and disobedient Eastern neighbours, this cannot be done well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of the intruders: to scare them to death.
It's enough to stick, and the robustness will stick to you in a way that doesn't have to get worse.
The lively head will set you up and start and sharp, and on the way will accompany (as soon as) an unrelenting salesman and a reviver.
Maybe it's too bad that the speaker can't actually fix his stick.
We'd also be looking for a lot of scarfs and scarfs.
Oxalis corniculata (Oxalis corniculata).
A small apple that tolerates dry environments.
And so it's between the outdoor curtains near my place.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which is part of the expansive flowers, but it gives a glimpse of a beautiful feeling about wheat.
It's between the outdoor curtains.
She's unquestionable. She's in our garden.
She likes a dry environment, she's easily adaptable, modest and unsolicited.
They make leaves with chaotic composition, but that's why they're worth watching and taking pictures.
In short, there is only a beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves, as well as with purple escorts.
Brazilian Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes healthy diet during breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric company SPRS came in a shocking way to try to impart to women knowledge of the importance of good food by heating images of children with breast-feeding.
Human breast milk is made up of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which deliver to infants all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
It is recommended that pregnant women and newborn mothers increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should take.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic development of their children and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that poor diets had a negative impact on the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates interest, although Nine's trying to take over leadership at today's Show
By the end of the year, Karl Stefanovic and Lissy Wilkinson to Canberry had not been able to create sufficient increase in the assessment for Today.
Nine's morning show from national capital after Malcolm Turnbull toy Abbott.
Rival Sunrise and host David Kochem and Samantha Armytage met in London as part of a week long series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, the Niagara Falls and Cancun.
Aussie TV did not seem to care so much for this remote tyranny because it recorded an average of 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 today's broadcasters.
Today, compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), the number was lower, but it was up to the last quarter (343,000).
Today, in the last few months, it's filled out a space on the Sunrise.
In August, there were an average of 318,000 in Today compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349 000 spectators and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
Wind changes affect more than Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for your help!
Added TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
A great report for Seven was a stunning debut 800 words with a former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently inhabited father, who will decide to move with his two children to the eastern part of New Zealand, has on average a very powerful 1,219 million spectators.
Critics thought that Thomson would have been able to shut down a television hit without the rappers Rebecca Gibney star.
The result of last night's show is clear yes.
The X Factor from Seven has left a strong 1,136 million viewers, which has now defeated The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed surveillance the second night The Chase Australia.
The first half of the new television show (from 17:00 to 17:30) that Andrew O'Keefe' had on average 446 000 viewers.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators — enough to win a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 spectators and a second half of the incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the decline in The Chase Australia from the second night, Nine will be convinced that the Hot Seat at 17:30 will finally win.
The Chase Australia is replaced by a million Dollar Minute, which failed to defeat McGuiru's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect boy - but who will choose?
A secret discovered?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may not be willing to find out who wins Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to Bachelor, she's trapped in an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who stay will definitely not tell who's the right one to finally get pink.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before they were just two, thankless told us who wins.
Sam Wood holds the tongue for the teeth to the quarter final.
All three women lyrically explained why Wood was a perfect man, quoted his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive motives as reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, on the question, "If not, who's gonna get Wood's final flower?", their answers could work as a coyote about who's getting the Bachelor's heart.
Like Jeavons-Fellows, the Markos were quick to name Mackay as here, who would be the best to go to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been sharing a relationship since a certain day.
"From the moment I entered the house and observed Sara and Sam's energy, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course," Jeavons-Fellows says.
"Sarah is a truly earthly woman, she's very funny with her," said Markoski.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They're good together, and they're happy.
Sarah Mackay thinks they could make a nice couple with Sam Wood.
For her own claim that during his last visit at home, she realized that Wood could be "the right one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a game - I now opened my heart to him," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose, if it wasn't for her, she would look mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls alike - it's between Snow and Lana indecisive.

Jarryd Hayne had several possibilities to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in his move to the United States, and many teams asked for his great start last year's training.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit after the rest of the season, because he made a mistake, which he made in the conversion of the Australian Rugby League at the first climb from the top at Tuesday's 20:3 in Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after Reggie Bush was hurt.
Tomsula was also still honest in the dress after the game.
Instead of feeding the new ones before the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at the press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, also announced that Hayne was encouraged by a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and only try to play another game.
During the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne made his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start that Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoped for at his NFL debut.
Hayne was arrested in surrendering when after a mistake he left the field and later told the Australian Hamish & Andy radio duo on 2DayFM 104.1 the worse start of his career in NFL.
"It happens, you're just focusing on another game and that's all," Hayne said
Hayne compared the trap to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in his own white territory led to the Trinity of Queensland.
It was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo with fans on which he holds the Australian flag on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Rus Vladimir Putin will take part in a discussion on the rights of homosexuals
In 2003, Russia's wealthiest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested by the targeted gunmen at the Siberian edge.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his democratic efforts were limited.
The U.S. has become an immigrant who's been taking over the property.
Two of them emigrated in 1984 and their property acquired a new owner.
After 1989 the property could no longer be restored, so the two turned to state claims for damages under the law on extrajudicial rehabilitation.
The court first assigned them the required amount, i.e. over 2.8 million crowns, but the court has amended their order so that it has granted them only a total of 90,000 crowns, indicating that the amount of the refund is determined in accordance with the 1991 price rules.
The Supreme Court of the Emigrants has become the Supreme Court and has attached to them the amount initially charged.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, has turned the complaint to the U.S.
In the meantime, such a change in social and economic conditions occurred that the refund granted under the then applicable legislation - although it was then an adequate refund in relation to the property concerned - today only reaches a fraction of the value of the property.
"This can't go to the jury of the next-door participants to repay the authorised persons who have been claiming their rights at least since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to provide a refund before," the judge, rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, explained why the U.S. has been on the side of immigrants.
"The U.S. has repeatedly expressed its intention that the general courts should act in return cases in such a way as to prevent possible inconsistencies from being dealt with in the failings of authorised persons and that the purpose of the return procedure should always be met, so that the breach of the property charge caused by acts of the former totalitarian State is lifted," the judge added.
Evaluate in music Studio DVA is now creating Radka Fisherová.
In contrast, Radka Fisher became the world's youngest Evita, when, in 1998, in her twenty years, she created the role of wife of Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musician Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague Theatre Spiral.
To return to the same role, he says, "Evita's engagement today has not been very balanced."
Evita's not just a great role, it's also a responsibility.
In the role of the first lady of Argentina, Monica Absolon recommended her.
I saw Moncza in Evita three times, and it certainly was inspiring to me.
I saw a whole new concept here all of a sudden.
I'm all in favour of the more modern adjustments, but this is just a particular one.
"The Region of Ondřeje Sokola is original, remote and contemporary," says Fisher.
The intelligent transmission of the musical train between the two singers comes at the Christmas concert of Monica Absolon on September 27 from 19 hours in Studio DVA.
He's doing Evita's musical compositions tonight.
The experience will certainly include a joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Utish your crying, Argentina!).
In a limited number of performances, Ondřij Sokol will also jump off the stage when the film will be filmed by Karl Roden as President of Perón.
In the interest of the public, further deadlines were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech music studio Evita introduces Studio DVA in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
In the state of Ondřeje Sokola, Monica Absolon was first taught the main role of a woman.
After her side, Karel Roden appears as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strènáčik.
The legendary songs from the work of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with the Czech texts of Michael Prostějovský sounding in a live orchestra led by Kristof Mark, who already participated in the first introduction in the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after the police shot rubber missiles at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber missiles to the point of protestors against the new state constitution, appointed an official on Wednesday.
There was violence on Tuesday night in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior periodic officer, says that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the police station and some threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal points out that the police used the gas and then fired into the air before they turned to rubber missiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, they say.
It was not immediately clear why rubber missiles, known for their ability to kill, were traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, evidently caused a high number of deaths.
This campaign was the last week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern part of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic groups said they had set up a new province under the proposed new constitution and mitigated their political influence.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal were also recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which requires the creation of its own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent attacks.
when the four main political parties signed the agreement on the division of the country into the province — a great step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial question in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled over for centuries.
The new constitution has lasted since 2008, but lawyers have accelerated the process after the earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted this week in Kathmandu on the establishment of a draft constitution and the officials state that the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We mustn't panic right now.
After losing the ice of the master Lithuania, you didn't even have a home duel with the hockey player Sparta (3:5).
Don't you worry about a similar catastrophic entry into the extralige like a year ago?
I hope there's nothing like it coming back.

NHC predicts 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the most secure Cape Verden islands is a 60% probability of tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, led by the U.S. National Hurricane Centre on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles also has a 60% probability of developing tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, adding weather forecast with a seat in Miami.
Google has launched a campaign to select 11 million dollars for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has stated that it will launch a campaign aimed at choosing $11 million for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees who have sailed the European States in the course of the war of abandoned and poor countries. Each of them will double the amount of Google selected.
Google announced this on its blog a very unusual way.
The report on her blog was published by an employee of Google Rita Masoud on the basis of personal experience when she was a seven-year-old with her family from Kabul.
"We traveled on many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," Masoudová said.
I was lucky.
But the worsening immigration crisis in Europe is still more and more families, like this one, willing to help.
All contributions will be divided between 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that all contributions made through the google.com/refugeerelief page to the amount of $5.5 million double.
Europe faces the greatest wave of refugees since World War II. Most of them come from Syria, abandoned by the four-year war, which has only escaped 4 million people this year.
Many people also run away from the war of rejected Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetes may be a useful surgery of fainting
The benefits of losing surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too soon to say that mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after surgery of abortion than those with non-surgical treatment.
"The data on mortality lasts for a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on the surgery of death, who wrote an introductory to a new JAMA surgery study.
Surgery operations, bariatric surgery are used to reduce the stomach of different methods.
Reduce the hunger and limit the human body to absorb food.
During the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people with morbidity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or more.
BMI, which measures the ratio of the height-related weight, is considered to be normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values 25 or higher indicate the excess of persons and people with a value of more than 30 are considered mandatory.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Hospital Min-Sheng in Taiwan used data collected from the study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypass and gasstrettomy - in type 3 diabetes treatment procedures in people who were mildly obese.
The mean BMI among those undergoing surgery was reduced from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year, according to study.
In the meantime, BMI remained at approximately the same level as for those who did not receive surgical treatment for diabetes.
Diabetes has been completely resolved in 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, only 1 per cent and only 2 per cent of patients were completely resolved for the comparison of diabetes.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol were demonstrated "in general better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Researchers also monitored patients on the level of A1c haemoglobin in the blood that reflects the transient level of blood sugar in the body.
Haemoglobin A1c is best maintained below 7 percent, reports researchers.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin of A1c of approximately 9 per cent decreased by approximately 6 per cent.
However, this value remained at approximately 8 percent in the group treated.
But this better "glycaemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of A1c hemoglobin - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After five years, the group lost more weight than the gastro-intestinal group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), reached higher BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent), and was more likely to have diabetes (46.9 per cent versus 16.7 per cent).
While the new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from studies of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone at the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about 29 per cent higher chance of survival in the next 15 years compared to a group that tested more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show improvement in the survival of patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, it is a comforting result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Just here, this work is critical, because it indicates that surgery is safer in a lower BMI group," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, it indicates.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after the decrease in BMI patients between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long for people to show the seriousness of the situation," he says.
I think that once these genetic changes are brought together, which are firmly proposing their bodies with obsessiveness and sugar, the journey back is really difficult.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to understand all refugees, Dalai Lama said, and added that the real solutions to the current refugee crisis lie in the near future.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the home countries of refugees.
Dalajlam addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lam Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is devoted to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He claimed that under the present circumstances, human interest should be put to the fore in the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, no matter how amazing, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to solve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution, how to bring true peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing the question of violence, Dalai Lama also expressed complaints on George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack and claims that "the US's violent response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in President Bush's letter and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent road.
I know his motives were good, but he used his strength and created unexpected consequences," he told Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have experienced a cure in the last 4 years
The toxicology centre around the United States reported almost 400 percent of growth since 2010 in children up to 12 years of age who had contracted a highly alcoholic cure, according to the toxicology centre in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the toxicology centre of Georgia, the number of health care services in children up to 12 years of age reported at the food control centre increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children receive these products more often, and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to emergency," said Lopez CNN.
Some children drink sanitation deliberately, while some want to make an impression on their friends or as a challenge on social media.
The videos on Youtube show the nanny how they drink the cure because of the cheap habit.
They reportedly mixed the sanitation with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive appetite of the means.
"Children don't think that it could hurt them," Lopez said.
Many more attractive (sanitary) are those who are perfumed.
At the disposal there are sanitary products with honey of strawberries, mushrooms or oranges, which are very pleasing to the children.
The sanitation contains between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Especially in young children, several holes can mean alcohol poisoning.
"It is a highly concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 at Kansas City Medical Director at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't let a glass of whiskey fall like that either, but people leave these sanitations out and when they get kids to them, it's a fast way to consume alcohol.
Nhaija Russel, a six - year - old girl who recently had four different parts of the healing agent with an egg’s appetite and was taken to the hospital for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is a double value of dust considered to be a maturity in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside the Atlantic.
Nhaija spoke invisible words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a single baby hospital for any signs of brain trauma, because the girl fell for alcohol and fell to her head, Ritchey says.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Nhaija's mother.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to arrange for children's access to sanitation.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some medical devices have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after the accumulation of a cure containing toxic, undeclared ingredients.
Doctors thought that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was indicated as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year-old students in North New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products in the room," the police report said.
The teacher is very allergic to the sanitation and banned their presence in the room.
The police considered the plan to be a "innocent complaint," and referred to the school district discipline,
Fáma: No conflict in Celtic team
Griffiths is baccating the talk about the insomnia in Celtic, while Dealal admits that Hopes are in the wrong place, but he's going to do it again.
Hearts will fight with the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is worried that the new forces from the ice break the unit.
Dons increase their jump over Celtic by 5 points
Penalties from the first half of ADMA Rooney's administration assured Aberdeen of a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, thereby winning Dons a five-point jump between himself and Celtic.
Griffiths refuses to speak of insomnia
This situation has led to riots in Celtic, which have been rejected by Griffiths, which insists that he and his associates do not work under any pressure from increased supervision in preparations for the fight with the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of Scottish title rivals the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Deputy Rangers and former representative of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer argues that the Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no longer any rivalry among them for title.
De Boer, who is currently Ambassador Ajax, says, "In the Netherlands, they don't show it the best of Celtic matches anymore, and why?"
Because there's no Rangers.
Now people don't just talk about the Rangers' return.
They're talking about the old company.
They're talking about both teams together, and they're just interested in it.
At the Old Company's games, there's a lot of tension and not only people from Scotland are watching these games.
I turn things back to the good, Deal's committed.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a bit confused, but the Norwegian chief committed himself to turning things back to the good.
The defeat of Malm and the subsequent escape from the League of Masters was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now applies to the top of a five-point board.
But Deila says, "Celtic's been through a bad time and he's getting up again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad with the current action.
We're all the same - but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic support because it makes players much better.
Now it's very important to stay with you.
Warburton's worried about the icebox.
Despite the comments that appeared a few weeks ago and indicated that he had already identified some of his ice targets, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the large purchase of supplies and insists that he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox team.
Former Chief Brentford says, "The ice transition window is very different from this summer."
Players coming in summer have a whole pre-season period to stay, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes more damage will arise by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Transitional objective Celtic Michu indicates retirement
Swansea Michu's attacker, who was connected with Celtic in a transit window, indicated that he could go to retirement after breaking his contract with Swansea.
A 20-year-old shooter has had two years of trouble with an intruder and has not been able to find a way out of Wales this year.
Hearts will fight SFA for comments against Nelson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the closet and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card for this defense was later cancelled - one about the third red card issued by the decision-makers Colum, who was called.
Neilson stands behind his claim, saying, "I have no doubt about integrity, I have commented on the performance."
Griffiths committed to avoiding Tynesastle
The hardheaded Hibbe was severely beaten after he confessed to singing a song with a text designed for the former player Hearts Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was a derby and it was a dangerous moment," said the attacker and continued, "I can say for sure I'm not going back to Tynacastle unless it's in Celtic dress."
The Council in Tanzania believes in Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United still believes in repairing the situation by current team management - but admits that the crash on the game must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for action again," promises Donnelly.
McCinnes likes to be a "crazy victory" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to take a desperate stand against Hamilton Accies in order to succeed them in winning seven leagues after themselves and a five-point jump before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to the first half of Adam Rowey's administration.
McInnes points out, "There's no team that won anything, no more games or leagues without winning this kind of game."
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged while the UK's total unemployment is rising
In Scotland there is no change in the number of 164 000 in the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the level in the UK (5.5 per cent), as reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three-month period, and the number of workers now stood at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 70.0 per cent during the quarter - which is the number above the British average of 73.5 per cent.
The State Secretary of Scotland David Mundell said in a comment on the latest data: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly the year Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we witnessed another improvement in the labour market and Scotland's employment has grown, while unemployment has fallen.
Why was I a witness to the reform in Oklahoma?
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will follow the man's death.
If this happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in the gallery watching the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who's going to be repaired by a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officers who would testify to his death.
I first received a call in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approaches, I'm starting to be scared of it.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists should be allowed to follow the corrections in America and because it is often more requests than free space, a morbid lottery is being performed, which decides who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of posts for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen, he'll be watching the whole repair uninvited.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to my closest friends, Richard Glossip, and I've made a special vacation for him through a month of telephone calls and a couple of half an hour's visit.
I like that kid.
We laugh often when we talk together.
Prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a note block and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'm gonna have to remember all the details.
One of the Oklahoma journalists accused me of having compromised my neutrality on Twitter.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the predator as soon as he's told it, get access.
I complained to her.
She assumed that "it could have formulated better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could ever remove me from the witness list.
But he wants an international journalist who'll be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help to prevent the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post journalist, will be on my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His crimes after the murder of Barry Van Treese would have made him guilty of the crime.
But I believe there's a great chance he's innocent of murder.
I firmly believe that sufficient evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the correction is bad.
And from this point of view, I'm going to watch his death.
I can't say I'm really being objective.
To this end, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing a man I love dying the rest of death.
A man disappeared from the Canning River after a police hunt
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he expelled a man from Canning River.
A man from Petrha who is running away from the police did not leave after he got into a small pool of water just a meter from a policeman who tried to force him to talk to him to get back to the shore.
The Canning Vale police were called up at an incident over to Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get them out of the river Canning.
But he didn't get far.
"Stand in the water and repeat 'I'm not going out, just come for me," said Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to wear a uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic and a police deal."
"People sometimes try to do something fun," said Castledine.
The Ben Cousins football champion gives a memorable example.
In 2006 Cousins drove the car into the basement to avoid the bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired locals to start planning Ben Cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the editors tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race
Peeter Moody accused the Ranger Racing Victoria of trying to get his spade last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He focused on the editor and the integrity department Racing Victoria and came out of the conviction that they had a personal campaign against him with Lady Tattai's late grabbing on the day of the race, which was the last drop for him on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the race and found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidarin's positive spring on a cobalt that couldn't explain.
He went into the language about the accusations of espionage for 18 months and didn't want it to look like a "dry threat."
"I didn't mean to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you're just feeling so frustrated that it's all coming out of you all at once," said Moody.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get some sleep.
I want to go with my head up and let the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
When I start to think differently, I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm gonna do with my license.
Earlier Moody released a bomb in his conversation for the racing.com, that his department's integrity tried to spy on him.
"Before eighteen months of Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him employment in my stables to find out what things are going on in my stables," Moody said at Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a cheater.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information, because they're trying to catch me completely burned.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL, and Bernard Sundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's a personal matter?
Will RVL grow a few balls and arrange for people outside the training position to take responsibility for what's going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really so bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think they are.
Maybe I need to take my license and get rid of me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now gives them material to think.
But I got to the point when I don't care about it anymore, and I'm sad about it.
I'm really sorry.
I'll press them and hand them over to them to make a decision.
I have support for my family and I can leave.
The frustration of the coach increased with a long-term investigation for cobalt, including Lidari, and the recent seizure in it sparked the feeling that "may be an hour of your license on the table."
Mood, the most famous for the preparation of the undamaged Black Caviar champion, marked the treatment rule on the day of the race for the "Laughter" after the horse was applied to his feet with a clay wrap or blue, which is against the rules.
It's against competition rules.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
Someone from my team was wrong to put a mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and so did it.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the store on the day of the race to which the officers had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The cobra driver he caught was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a cyclist on a weekend in Cobra and after the squad.
The cyclist was transported by plane to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by cars on the Murray Valley main road on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping and helping the wounded driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed himself to the Shepparton police.
It is expected that it will be charged with failure to stop in the event of an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
A cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, remains in a stable hospital.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy returns to the rivals due to the wrestling fortress
Craig Bellamy, coach Melbourne Storm, criticised the moves of his players as "setting up a plan" to two NRL favorites of the primeship.
Trent Robinson, coach Sydney Roosters, said the decision-makers allowed Storm players to "warst" his players during the controversial victory of the Storm team at the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach Brisbane Broncos, made an easy note on Strorm after his team won final qualifications over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game "surveillance" of the league and according to him, two from Queensland were not "too big" at wrestling.
Bellamy defended the moves of his players and said that during them they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation increased his self-awareness because his team was criticised by two leading coaches, which may mean that they are afraid of defeating the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about harassment when we were defeated 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that in the last year, we haven't changed anything from our defensive system and technology, and the last few weeks, we've just focused on contacting in progress, and that meant turning around for us.
Trent's been here for three years, and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how such things always come into this part of the year.
Bellamy underestimated Bennet's idea of "aggravating football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's team of St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 premiere by playing "suffering" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. He was as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne then said it was completely one of his own.
But now he's got a team that can play the style of the game that seems overwhelming, especially his young hostages at their speed.
Such a football you'd like to play if you had this type of player available.
He said that in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his football style - but not every team has two hostages like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It stirs me more self-consciously because they say things like that because they're afraid of fighting against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got into big fights.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that in the Storm and Roosters match, more branches fell than in the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos team was probably good, wasn't I looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are the interruptions and non-scrupulous attempts interesting?
I think it's an agenda.
If they mention us, it means we'll meet again in a certain phase.
The storm has a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday evening in AAMI Park. The tickets will be on sale from the morning of the next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets $20,000 bail for drug charges
A man who faced a possible life - style of holding 40 kilograms of cocaine, which was spread out from Queensland, received a bail of $20,000.
Marko Maximovic (29 years) was one of five men who had been arrested last month by the federal police looking for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht, who came from South America through Vanuatu and landed in Coomer in August.
Maximovic was watched at a meeting with the defendants in the port in the morning and later met with them at Coomer Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he was faced with a potential solution of his life for the possession of commercial cocaine, Lawyer Maximovice defended that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he could be in the coffee shop entirely by accident and innocent.
The judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was of the opinion that Maximovic would flee.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the middle of the courthouse.
In a corn case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
The mother and stepfather Maximovice jointly offered a bailout of $20,000 for his release.
"After reading both individuals' sworn statements, it is obvious that the deposit of $20,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Their own efforts were evidently insufficient, for the accused did not remain in court, warning.
Maximovic has been given bail, provided he surrenders to both the Australian and Serbian passports, will report to the police daily and will observe the ban from 18 hours in the evening to 6 in the morning.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to push pedophiles to send pictures
Pedophile used the phone of a eleven-year-old girl to get photos of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep, then logged in to her online chat, where he had a lot of inappropriate pictures of kids who sent him another user.
The girl then checked and found out that she was missing her phone and then found it in the hands of sleeping Hogg.
She passed it, and before she warned her mother, she found disturbing news.
The police involved and saw five photographs, then the analysts found the address and found "anxious" searching on the web using expressions to search for unbalanced images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that his reason was "telling pedophiles" on the Internet before "preventing that he is a police officer and scares them."
A fiscal representative, Elidh Robertson, said for Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was dependent - that it was dependent on fear of people.
He admitted that he did a computer search, but he claims he just wanted to pretend he was a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send others.
According to him, he was doing it because he was trying to trick them.
He claims to have jumped over his shoulder and said he wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When the girl found the news on her phone, she called her mother, cried and cried.
She saw the uneven images on her phone and the accused was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the accused used her computer and Playstation to talk to the girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, a residence in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted guilty of a complaint regarding the adoption or the provision of inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, violated the conditions of bail on 25 January and failed to be heard in court on 24 March of this year.
Advocacy lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the list of sexual offenders, because he could argue that in his act there was "no basic sexual sub-text."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael made a verdict in October for the reporting of social workers.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but was kept in custody before hearing about other unsolved cases.
He was placed on a list of sexual offenders before the date of his judgment.
Zimbabwen Robert Mugabe presented a bad speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell earlier this year on the stairs leading to the podium.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall became viral in social media.
The opening of Parliament was also reinforced by the opposition legislators' assertions that they had received anonymous threats of killings that they had warned them of during Mr Mugabe's speech.
Last month he was drafted and provoked during his statement on the state of the people in parliament - which is the word he said again in Tuesday.
The president of the Movement for Democracy Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians adopted text messages on their mobile phones with warning to prevent Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from numbers that don't appear, but it's called 'death'," he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and as soon as it leaves Parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief stated that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai has concerns about threats to the MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is about to reduce the number of jobs to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard has abolished 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the costs of business services.
The HP company will later be divided into two companies listed on the stock exchange and will separate trades with computers and prints from its faster growing business hardware and services operations.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, according to HP.
"This restructuring activity will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and chairman of the post-distribution agency.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than today's HP and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of businesses that will help businesses move into a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the requirements of our customers all over the world.
Hewlett Parkard Enterprise will have an annual income of more than $50 billion after the company's declaration and "will focus on providing non-competitive integrated technology solutions" to the company.
This results in the deployment of a company founded in 1930 by the University of Stanford by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who produced electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was renamed "the home of Silicon Valley."
HP went through massive reorganisation to control the movement from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This trend of HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the latest in this sector based on the conviction that the highly specialised company has better results.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta says the co-players must get to Jack Wilsher's injured in front of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed for Wilsher that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to the plan, there's no reason he won't play again on the holidays.
This best scenario already means that Wilsher will certainly miss at least four more English games and, from a historical point of view, his involvement in the next annual European championship is obviously not true.
The great damage to this latest problem is that Wilsher ended the last season strong after her ankle was injured and then returned to the former form during the preselection.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," says Wenger.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It's not about anything special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he suffered before.
This could be from a purely medical point of view because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of other injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There's also an unpleasant pattern here.
The research carried out by Primer Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different injuries to Wilshire since he had his game debut six years ago.
During the last five years, he played only in 65 league matches in Arsenal of the total number 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons from 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs, which lost most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the charmed circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back after injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win the competition," Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will have a career he deserves.
Arsenal starts a campaign in the League of champions on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to arrive.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain balance and let players who need to breathe out," Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite of the F group process, Maximir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most frightening stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after the last season held the campaign "inviolable".
At midnight, the stadium was devastated by a 3.2-degree earthquake in Richter.
This year, in Zagreb, it was a month ago.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal was taught from the last season of the League of Champions when he was capitalising against Monaco and remains a distant hope that he will lead the club to the first victory in the European Cup.
"This setup is amazing," says Wenger.
Arsenal never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be a realist.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: comedy show that gives us serious instruction about male friendship
The absence of similar views in various shows is in the eye, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever, as regards suicide among young men up to 15 years of age.
In 2013, it was the only cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the United Kingdom and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) marked 2015 as the Year of Men, whose aim is to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help if necessary.
In the heart of this battle there is friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of over 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that in case the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, it represents a circle of healthy friends half the chance of mental problems.
But to make friendship work, of course, it must be within reach first.
In this communication through social media with emphasis on style and not on content of the message, the immediate response is often prioritised before meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, we have doubled our need to look stronger, more loving and more successful, even though we are actually more isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - that have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and the game maker recently explained, money really doesn't buy much luck.
The beauty of the series Friends was the source of this thought for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, which were influenced by friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, while watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all the hints of knowing that yes, men can also relate to it, even though they usually leave their feelings for themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: ...."My role as listeners to people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies has really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel inability to communicate with friends.
The old order "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the sequences that will arise in my memory when I try to offer a longer-term reconciliation mechanism.
It highlights a few moments in a man's friendship.
With regard to my assignment, the state of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a closer, friends and family network.
So if you're going to the FredsFest scheduled Comedy Central station this weekend, why don't you take your friends for a glass to Central Perku, where the interior will be completely reprocessed for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello to him.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
The series Friends will be uploaded to Comedy Central station from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped the PSG laugh Malmo party
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuid and Edinson Cavan after the shooting of the branch against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored his debut in the League of Masters and thus helped the PSG win the Swedish Malmo team on Tuesday.
Here's a report on the match and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in the Tuesday match and Paris Saint-Germain started their trip to the League of Masters with a final 2-0 victory against Malmu at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot the whites less than four minutes after her debut in the League of Masters, and this PSG player sent French champions after the victory, but then they threw a few chances, when they finally raised their score when Cavani shot the whites in 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in group A, and that is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, because they focus not only on the qualifications for the finishing rounds, but on improving their journeys to the quarter finals, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they won three points, it wasn't the classic performance of the Laurent Blanc and Zlatan Ibrahimovic team, he was a martyr and was later directed against his own home team and club, where he started his famous career in 1999.
"In the Masters' League, it is not easy to win outside or home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents trouble and looking comfortable in the defense is a good start, even though there are things that we will have to improve with the season process," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I'm sorry we didn't shoot one or two more branches.
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury as one of three changes to the PSG team, which kept this weekend 2-2 with Bordeaux in Liz 1, but was framed by Di Mario in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who moved the PSG in Europe to a new level after a break from Manchester United last month, and showed why when he entered the passport of Marc Verratti for Malma's defense and with a beautiful marriage he sent a sword behind Johan Wilanda's back to the distant corner of the market.
However, if someone expected it to start a grand victory of the PSG, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off and got to this stage, took place with 9 internationals in the basic assembly and five defenders and two detained hostages were a hard opponent.
But besides shooting Nikola Durdjice, who just passed the remote corner of Kevin Trappa's market in 34 minutes, they didn't offer it much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG itself took advantage of the attack by bad recordings and malicious conspiracy, which was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who could not shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot reached the network shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, it proved much more appropriate when it came to preparing opportunities for its partners and it was just from his recording when Di Maria sent a needle shot that ended in Wildand's bronze after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavanim, this Uruguayian head sent a sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic played him after the recording from the left wing of Maxwell.
This ended all of Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they could take some weight out of the match, and only the extensive progress of Wilda from a great distance had stifled David Luize's hopes and the score remained unchanged even at the time the goal of mastering Ezequiel Lavezzi was unknown at the end of the match.
Coach Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was above his team in class, Nor stated: "Our last game in the League of Masters was held in December last year."
Since then, we have played only a Swedish league that is not at the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
The club down for Paris.
It was an amazing match for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion for sale of shares
Glencore's business giant, based in Switzerland, who was hit by the collapse of the commodity prices, made an average of $2.5 billion from the sale of shares under his extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore submits in its statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay the debt.
This company, which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is faced with a decrease in commodity prices, as China's slowdown reduces demand and exacerbates market developments.
The issue of rights sent Glencore to the top of the London stock market at the time of the early business.
The stock jumped by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 of the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore discovered last week that selling shares worth $2.5 billion is part of a broader plan to reduce their debt of $30 billion, which has gathered about a third
The company sold new shares in the price of 123 pence for the share, which meant a 2.4% discount on the closing price in Tuesday.
Thus, 1.3 billion shares have been released at a total price of 9.99 per cent for the group.
As regards the extension of Chinese growth, the price of iron mines was reduced by almost half and of coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20 to 40 per cent.
The White House confirmed that Washington was visiting Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in his Tuesday report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on 25 September in the Barack Obama's response to a visit to Beijing, where the president called in in November.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his even Peng Liyuan to the state dinner that will take place after the talks are over.
“President Xi’s visit provides an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between the US and China and invites cooperation in addressing international, regional and common concerns and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the disagreements between the two states,” the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York at the UN in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to deal with controversial problems, including the concern of Washington from China's alleged cyberspionage and its increasing aggression in the waters of the South Sea.
How the refugee crisis broke the Schengen area.
The new lights fired by Germany have not pushed the European crew away, but it is already forcing the ship to change course, wrote the French newspaper Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the refugee problem: it will rather systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they move to the old continent - especially in Greece - than to argue about the future division of refugees on the basis of the quota, which is still more and more distant.
Six days after the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribution 160 thousand refugees, ministers of the Member States' internal priorities changed.
Before taking care of the final destination of the runners, it is necessary to filter those who are already coming today and resolve the fate of those who are already moving inside the Schengen area.
"The effective management of the EU's external borders is necessary for managing migration," the text of the ministers discussed in Brussels on Monday.
Following the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds itself at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increase its pressure.
It renews border controls, particularly with Austria, but without blocking the flow of those seeking asylum in this country.
The central power thus makes it clear that without it there is no free movement in Europe.
As evidence that Austria and Slovakia joined this measure on Monday, it has already served.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France also consider this, although with different intensity.
Hungary has moved on to this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permitted under the Schengen rules.
That it's a domino effect, but it's also a blind one.
The key question for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already gone to the Netherlands.
The French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière had an intensive discussion with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea isn't new, but it's going to happen.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of the new arrivals were already registered and identified by fingerprints.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any point of entry in its territory, because they fear more than others, so that there will be no camps in which refugees will gather on its account.
The real black hole is left in Greece.
On its islands near the Turkish coast, more than 200 thousand people arrived this year, twice as much as they had reached Italy.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after the overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge hot hole.
Athens, who are still in financial turmoil and waiting for a new government, put their hands to the clinic.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and the source of the current common elders for German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission has promised to introduce control points as soon as possible, but it has not given any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to Europe as a whole," the EU ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on this front.
This is therefore to be addressed in this country by the European Agency for Border Control Team Frontex.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for asylum and strengthen island surveillance.
"The need will be adequate for financial resources," warns the text submitted to the ministers for approval.
From the point of view of law, they will still have the last word of Athens.
The issue of the creation of genuine European border guards was not officially raised, but Europe is getting closer to it.
The new emergency situation of the eight-year-old, as well as the second-round question of mandatory quotas and 160 thousand refugees, which had been brought to the fore by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament and which was strongly supported by Angel Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their superiority.
The number, not duty, was kept in the text approved by most of the eighties on Monday.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only solid promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, already reached in June during the EU's Hectic Summit, Le Figaro will conclude.
Seven dead under the plain in the Alps, of which there are three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed a lion in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, German nationality is also a woman who survived as one of the affected eight-year-olds.
The previous news from the media said it was Polka.
A woman in her mid - 30 ’ s was hospitalized in Briancon with a serious leg injury.
According to the AFP, the dead were mostly four-quarters.
"The rescue action ended, and the victim's body was also transferred to the identification of Briancon," the prefect of the Hautes-Alpes Pierre Besnard department said.
Unfortunately, it happened around noon in the mountainous area of Pelvoux at the top of the mountain Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 meters.
"The found van was 250 metres wide and about a meter high," said the chief of rescuers Nicolas Colombani.
According to him, the eight - foot - high group was about 1,900 feet [3,900 m] of snow.
Meteorological service today has not protected the area from bad weather.
Tropišovský pre-fighting with Brago: Finally, Europe is right.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský, at his premiere in the Cup, managed to go through the front of the European League with the football player Liberce, and now he is looking forward to enjoying the right Europe with this team.
Famous at the start of the main stage of the competition welcomes the finalist from 2011 Bragu and according to the dog she wants to use her game style.
After all the nerves in the exhausting fights, when every goal and every situation could put you on the way to the dream group, now we're there and we're gonna play six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don't have to be afraid of every incased market, we can play our tactics, and we're not bound by a double match.
"I look forward to it and it's a real Europe, before it was just a qualification," Trpišovski said at the press conference.
The guy thinks he's a top team.
It will be very active, they have Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent might be even harder to say he doesn't have a name, but then in his camp, he has a player who gave Manchester a shower.
"It's an excellent whole at the top level of teams," Trpišovský said.
But Brag doesn't think so.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we've both shown in the home competition and in the past that we're strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that," the viewer whose team lost eleven duels this season was just the opening Superpohar in Plzna.
They believe that Liberec can also make Braze use of his style.
We're waiting for a team that's gonna be strong on the ball, at the same time, it's not typical of them being disciplined.
They play with 4-4-2 with a quick transition to the attack phase.
"It's a very difficult opponent, but we've discovered weaknesses, but the most important will be how our players will do it in the game," Tropišký said.
In the past, we studied a lot of opponents, which helped us a lot, and this time we wanted to focus on our game, which we also helped train.
"And we definitely want, even though it will be very demanding to play according to our notes," the watch added.
Student films run the Písek, starting an international festival.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries this year reported their work in the 15th year of the International Festival of Student Films in Písk.
Four dozen of them, which the committee of students and educators sent to the finals, will take place from 15 to 18 October in Portyč.
The best of them will be the international jury, the speaker of the Jakub Charvát festival said.
Every year, the festival has its special theme, which separates from the festival hall.
She's a detective this year.
Director of this year's celebration evenings Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre.
"And of course we also need to resolve the crime that has been committed in our support this year," Charvat said.
Visitors will see the selection of the most interesting of student creation - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by the international jury, for example the winner of last year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
Festival organizers are preparing a follow-up program every year.
Comes Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional player at Didgeridoo Ondřej Smeykal, turbochanson group Do we fly?, plays the Cup of Bread or, for example, Petra Hapkova with the live story at the bar.
The festival will host two photography exhibitions.
The first entry of the graduate of the dog film school and the holder of prestigious ratings, including that of the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Aschenbrenner.
The second exhibition is approaching the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after a tragic earthquake.
In words with visitors came cameraman and documentary Martin Čech, his film The Cameraman accompanied his music by Gerhard Gruber and poet parents Brukner, Novotný and Hlach at the workshop of the sochaer Jan Novotný will kiss his new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year, we also remember Miroslav Ondříčka, the FAMO patron in Pisque, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his link that will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop joint links and film novels," the speaker said.
This will certainly help the Pitching Forum, where students can meet with film professionals, graduate several job competitions at once and get a job like that.
The festival is connected with the creation of Private Higher School of Film in Písk.
Its founders, Vladana's husband and Miloň Terča, organized the first anniversary in 1997.
By the sixth year, he was born once in two years.
In the event of a CK crash, the insurance companies are required to pay the customer's claims in full.
Insurance companies should build client claims when the travel office falls in full.
It decided on this on Wednesday when it approved the amended new legislation on the conditions of business in road traffic.
Travel agents will be able to replace insurance against a bank guarantee, according to the proposal aimed at assessing the Senate.
Insurance companies with an obligation to build client claims even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Local Development for Corrections takes, argues, the consumer's protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end the insurance of travel offices against bankruptcy when it is new to pay.
But the proposal also criticises travel agencies.
Without insurance, they're either gonna have to end up or go abroad.
The Ministry of Local Development Karl Šlechtová (for the UN) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not eurocompatibilities.
She pointed out this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client has a claim for full repayment of the money regardless of the limit of insurance.
Insurance companies will receive sufficient information on the management of travel offices and will be able to determine the correct limit, Šlechtová stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but must have such a limit to be feasible," Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek said.
The bank guarantee is not going to work because no one gives it unlimited.
"The travel officers will have to finish their activity or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
A member of the Czech Travel Office Association and the agency Tomio Okamura (SPD) with Kalousk's concerns on the basis of a survey between the members of the CK.
"Stop leading us lobbing insurance," he said.
The statement of insurance shall not make the Ocamura relevant, nor shall any of their official written statements in that sense exist in that sense.
But they're going to find out if the travel agencies are going to make a date, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
She also warned Jana Fischer (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the Czech Competition Travel Office Association, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about climbing stairs to the Czech Travel Office.
According to Fischer's travel offices, insurance will not be able to sit down.
"Consumer protection works," Judge Fischer said.
Her proposal for the release of the disputed passport was not approved by the Snowman.
Nor did Vojtech Filip (KSČM) come forward with a proposal to refer the proposal to the Committee for a alleged dispute with the civil law.
Philip pointed out to travel agencies that he considered to be a threat to consumers.
In view of the verdict of the Constitutional Court, the rapporteur of the proposals by Martin Berdichová (ANO) made her proposal to limit the liability of the insured in cases where they could not know that the insurance enforcement did not cover the whole risk.
In the new world, there will be no originally proposed minimum four million insurance limit for passenger offices offering flights and a million limit for offices selling e.g. bus tickets.
The margin will remain at 30 per cent of the planned market for the sale of tickets.
However, the limit of insurance enforcement will have to be such that, in the event of a crash, the travel agent will cover all customer claims.
Norma also provides that travel agencies will have to reinstate the travel agency that organizes the travel agency in the traffic.
Travel agents will have to submit insurance before the contract is concluded, inter alia, information on the economy and the number of arrivals.
The approved amending proposal for a Committee on Public Administration shall also include other regular insurance information.
Travel agents will have to provide them with monthly information on the number of passengers and the number of tickets sold, the total price of the tickets sold and the amount of the stocks and the market for the tickets and the instructions on them.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel office has failed to fulfil any of the statutory obligations to insurance, it shall, in accordance with the proposal for repair or will be able to prohibit the conclusion of new contracts if the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of customers.
Novela is also going to adjust the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of aid for the mountain service on the basis of its application, which will always be made by the end of April for the next year.
The request will contain a report on the use of state money in the past year, a financial plan of expenditure and a two-year perspective.
According to the association, the legislator did not consider what would happen if the insurance company issued the CK contract.
This will not prevent the entry and the customers who bought the entry before the insurance claim will come to him by the association.
In such a case, the CK will suffer significant loss and may even damage, although its management was in good condition.
One way in which travel agents can cope with such a situation will be the claim for a refund.
Another possibility will be to go abroad and use a lot of soft conditions abroad, and then on our market we will act only as agencies, said the Vice-President of the Jan Papaž Association.
The proposal also includes a bank guarantee institution, but it is so unimaginable that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, because the bank guarantee cannot sound an unlimited amount.
In addition, according to the association, the change in the practice of today's de facto is unnecessary.
In two years' time, the whole law will have to be recast in the light of the new EU directive.
The Czech market is now operating a total of 942 active insurance travel offices.
Only three CKs have finished their activity this year.
Foreign travel agencies sell annual trips worth about 20 billion CZK.
Merkelová: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must be able to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees to Europe.
It was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after the talks with the German prime minister.
At the same time, she again appealed to the division of refugees who had already reached the EU between the Member States.
We need to help more countries where refugees leave, if any, where they stay after the government has left.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we are founded on decent conditions in refugee camps, such as in Jordan and Lebanon, that the German office has said that such a signal could also be more financial aid or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations.
"Scolt countries also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis in the European countries," Merkel added.
Earth Prime Minister Braniborska Dietmar Woidke said in this regard at the press conference that he expects genuine solidarity from all EU states.
The division of EU runners on the basis of long-term quotas, inter alia, will be rejected by the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke to speed up asylum in Germany.
People need to know first if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to be able to start faster with the integration of foreigners, the Defence Minister said.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends on the care of the commons should serve to integrate those who have a chance to obtain asylum.
It'll take more teachers to get the refugees over to Germany.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if there's a chance of integration, they can be a benefit for us, he said.
Matt Damon baggagees diversity in the film
Matt Damon confronted the African filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversion with the claim that it was not necessary after the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of the HBO project Greenlight interrupted the actor in Brown's series, stressing the need for alternative views about black protagonists in the scenario.
"When we're talking about a diversion, you're doing it by holding a movie, not by holding a show," Damon says.
She was shocked, she reacted to Brown with disbelief and woke up "Ho! Wow. Okay," when the comments about Martán got sent out.
Damon and Brown joined the well-known producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists' shows.
"I would like to appeal to people to think about whether the director is already anyone, how they will treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at the outset.
The only black person that's a hooker that packs a white passport.
The producer of Dear White People promoted the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the right to direct the film; Damon said that their regime "would finally give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was over, the social media exploded in harmony with Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni said, "Matt Damon jumped into the word of the only black man in the room, so he can explain to her that the diversion is so bad."
Tweet got more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 characters since it was published.
Damon's comment comes at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is in front of the social debate.
After the killing of a teenager Michael Brown, a white police officer in 2014, the movement of Black Lives Matter gained a national effect and pressed on the creation of laws and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colorful people.
In February, the singer Prince made an effort to move, while he introduced the nominated album in the category of the year during the award of Grammy.
"They're still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, the albums are still important.
The latest leading Black Lives Matter made a statement in answer to the question of the identity Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered as an hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the leaders declared.
Damon was recently reported on the list of fans, producers and the media of Moselles who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the display of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or already met with the pope is not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
Professional Horrorist and Pimp Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win American Ninja Warrior on Monday and take home one million dollars.
In the competition, which had just completed its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all obstacles to the track.
During the final season this year, two men fought for the last car, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was 30 seconds of more than 220 m long wool.
Britten graduated as the first one and became the first contestant in the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero beat her for three full seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview for reportingE! News immediately after his hard-earned victory and was known to be still in shock from winning the main price of $1 million.
"It's a wonderful feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," said Isaac E! in response to my victory.
"So suddenly... I can't even imagine what it's going to be like."
The executive producer Kent Weed provided a magazine interview with The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the finals and why Britten won't get any reward despite the fact that he became the first competitor to finish the track.
According to the rules, money belongs to those who finish the track as quickly as possible.
"If more competitors are in danger, the victory will be won with the best time," Weed said.
Even if the win of the main win changed his life, Brittan is satisfied with his performance.
"I don't think he'd do anything wrong with himself.
He's glad he managed to achieve what he did.
He got a warm welcome from the fans.
He's a great man, and he likes his family.
For your children and your wife, it's a hero."
Geoff told me, "If there should be someone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I win, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue the eighth season, starting in spring 2016.
Tigers from Detroit just passed right around Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For girls from Detroit, the second half of the season was just a walk in a pink garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, is now at the last location of the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers just turned down their defeat when they defeated Minnesota in the Tuesday match with the close result 5-4 at Target Field Stadium.
The twins missed the chance to approach the Houston Astros team and capture the second wild card in the American league.
Even for one night only, for Detroit, it was a return of words to Z, which was so impenetrable for them during the second half of the season.
"Playing is always fun and doesn't matter how," said the manager of Tiger Brad Ausmus.
The Tygras founder Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive performance and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then another in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed 6 1/3 fires and 3 surges.
It was his only third-played game from the last nine matches.
"This year I want to end with convincing results," said Simon.
"It's hard to enjoy the game when you sit on the bench often and that's why I want to get right into the game."
Victor Martinez's team tripped three times and made 2 rounds and his first download point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first tricycle match since the last June game, in which he hit himself four times in the battle against Seattle Marines.
"He's done well," said Ausmus.
"He looked good at the training, he fired significantly better and managed to get him into a fight."
Thanks to the three rounds at the end of the seventh shift, the twins got the greatest chance to get back to the game.
Byron Buxton's middle pole won a switch thanks to two points on the left-hand side of the game.
A true driver, Aaron Hicks, got a point thanks to the fixed thumb and Simon pulled Brian Dozier out before he was replaced by a left-wing Blaine Hardy.
Hardy had his only rival, Maure, and in front of him he had the Colonel Miguel Sana, who fired the ball and ran for two years and left Drew VerHagen behind.
With two ball players and a chance to remix in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send a third meter over two years.
Plouffe has already won 27 rounds over two years in this season and rules the league tables.
Detroit held the ninth shift, Mauer won two points and Bruce Rondon secured a score of 5-4 for Tigers.
However, this line was arranged by Sana for three advantages.
Detroit took advantage of the advantages and won points at Phil Hughes.
The tigers won three rounds in the first two shifts against the winning rector, who got into the game after more than a month's break due to the inflammation of the back muscles.
“I certainly didn’t imagine such a start,” Hughes said, “but during the third shift, I felt that I was getting better at it.”
After he resisted the effort in the first shift, Hughes left one point at the second metre of Ian Kinsler.
Two exits for J.D. Martinez's right pole were taken out by Victor Martinez, who as the first round of all the years.
Victor Martinez interrupted his 0-21 series.
The third meter Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the game and scored another round, but Victor Martinez was beaten when he tried to run for the third time.
The tigers added in the second shift, when James McCann and Anthony Gose's driver got two and a single point and on the result table lighted the score 3-0.
"That got us to the knees," the manager introduced Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it to the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of uppers, ended up in the third shift without points and replaced him with A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three years, got six fires and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, a real inventor of Tigris, ended the game with pain in the right shoulder.
Dr. James Andrews, who operated Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who is on the list of injured muscles in the shoulder since half of August, should be in the middle match.
Sancheze will replace the left-hand Daniel Norris, who will return after the injury and rise against the twins.
Since 30 June, when Norris was replaced as the left inventor of David Price, he has score 1-1 after 4 matches.
But since August 20th, he hasn't won yet because of the entrailed muscle.
Tigers and Twins play the third game at Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is set up by the Minnesota Left Speaker Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for an economy to open up to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, said President Xi Jinping to the group, whose task is to reform the yesterday.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," said the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group to deepen overall reform.
The promotion of parental opening brings new impetus and vitality, also provides a new space for economic growth, Xi says.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory approaches to the market, the release of border control policies, the support of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registry resident system.
The statement indicates that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and businesses that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be progressively tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is important because it will give the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensuring the legal environment and making the market more open, it will make a statement.
The government will also release control over the powers it delegates to companies and will ensure that the companies themselves will decide how to manage their business.
The declaration also states that China will allow the border area to display new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for supporting regional growth.
In an effort to open up a controlled sector by the State, more areas will be opened by private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies that are funded from abroad and provide them with better services," the statement states.
In addition, it will be easier for a foreigner to apply for a permit for a permanent stay or for a "green card", thanks to the optimization of the requirements and simplification of the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practise and develop a professional judge and a national representative was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and lead representatives Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovar region, there may be a new bed department.
According to the Heitman of the Karlovar region of Jakuba Panika (ČSSD), the current capacity of the bed compartments of two national hospitals and two private hospitals in the country should be sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of the agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
In the country, however, there are opportunities to expand your care.
For example, in the surgical department, a one-day surgery centre could be established where, according to the established concept, the performance of surgical units that do not require hospitalization longer than 24 hours would be carried out.
In which specific hospitals should work on one-day surgery, it is not clear yet.
In the skin department of the Karlovy Vary hospital, a laser centre could be created with the possibility of using laser technology for skin disease.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalic centre that would take care of patients with brain damage who are vegetative.
Such a centre should be set up centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility into an island hospital where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovary country, is the bed following care and in particular the patient's long-term care (LDN) bed, whose capacity in Njedka is insufficient and above all should be close to the bed of care acute.
Part of this device should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, recommending the concept.
As he points out, the beds are mostly missing after-care at the Karlovy Vary hospital.
There they could use abandoned buildings after centralization.
Recently, in the Karlovary country, there is a lack of a social health bed aimed at treating Alzheimer’s disease.
This bed is lacking throughout the Republic, so it could serve other countries as the Alzheimer's Centre.
The non-methods should also be prepared, as recommended, for the introduction of so-called bond beds to which European funds will be released.
"It is one of the beds that will be exposed to the areas of specialized care and will create space for the translation of patients after the move, for example after the cardiosurgical, neurosurgical, transplant or other move," the local concept of bed care describes.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
