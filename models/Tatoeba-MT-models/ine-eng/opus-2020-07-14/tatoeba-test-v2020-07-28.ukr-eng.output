Have you had a drink yet?
What do you know about Boston?
Tom, maybe he was a witness.
The station is nearby.
I'm not wearing this dress.

I refused this offer.

Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like it.
Use them all.

It's time for dinner.

Do you drink?
Tom will do this with you?
You don't sleep?
The night began on the fifth day.
Mary said she liked it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I was only in Tokyo once.
I got an electricity bill.
What color does it have?
Last week, I bought a new car.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be all right.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom was planning to do this.
The presence of all members is mandatory.

I like it, too.

Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She started playing the old song.
Why do they speak French?
That's a lie.
There is no pyramid in Europe.
It's almost spring.
She speaks two foreign languages.
That's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me that?
Let's go back.

I like that bitch.
Suddenly, though, he sensed a chill and sat back in his old chair.
Is he really married to Mary?
Do you still have him?
Do you love silk?
I knew they'd suspect her.
He cut through his pants.
Don't die, please!
Who won?
What very arguments can you use to help us?
Would they do that?
He's my friend.
Are you ready for the exam?
All your friends will be there.
It's Tom's fault.
I'd do it if you didn't stop me.
The problem is you.
I know math very well.
Don't worry about it!
I thought Tom had a good plan.
These doors won't open.
She speaks Chinese.
Your presence here means a lot to me.
Slow down, please.
Let's make a cake.
We are satisfied with the decision.
You and Tom got killed?
I saw him last week.
Who did Tom go to the store with?
Go back home.

What is your favorite food?
Excuse me, who are you?
You'll never be alone.
Why would Tom want to do this if he wasn't obliged to do it?
You don't have to call me.
It's time to go home.
Try to understand.
Of course, the plazas could swim.

The earth is covered with forests.
Aren't you going to do it again?
I'm sorry I ruined your wedding.
You need my team.
Tom doesn't want to wait in line.
I'm confused.
In popular culture, the phrase "Alla Abar" has become almost synonymous with terrorism.
I'm very hungry.
I fucked up your mouth and your city.
Maybe you'll meet him.
It's my fault, not yours.
Maybe Tom broke the car.
Don't panic!
It's very loud here.
I hope you're not afraid.
I thought it was true.
Tom may have borrowed money he needed from someone else.
Can you just do it now?
Why did you do that?

It's very unlikely that Tom will do it again.
The plan works.
I don't need a job.
I'm just a girl.
Tom was extremely angry.
I'd like to live in Boston.
Aren't you mad at Tom?
I think you should ignore Tom's replica.
You look confused.
You don't have to tell me how to do this.
We've been together for a long time.
That's what we think.
I didn't forget.
I like your shirt.
What nice tits they are!
Keep your promises.
I'll have dinner at 4:00 a.m.
You can't deny that he didn't do it.
For personal reasons.
I didn't have time.
You need to be more careful.
Nobody called us.
It's not time to eat.
The fire caused panic in the theater.
But I don't have the money.

The family is sleeping on the street.
We couldn't do that.
Don't forget that.
Wait a minute!
Tom must have been scared.
It's probably you.
What work plan are you proposing to me?
The owl is a night bird.
So I bought a watch.
It's been forty years.
Does that sound right to you?

Schoolwork starts at nine o'clock.
Tom was waiting for Mary to go to sleep.
Tom doesn't want to be the chief.
It's not worth the effort.
Does Tom still think Mary was lying?
I don't like the smell of the bell.
It's a simple rationale.
I'm not paid as much as I would like.
I'm sorry, but I can't have dinner with you.
The uninterrupted noise made us deaf.
Am I released?
Tom made himself a cup of tea.
We'll check it out.
You're angry now, aren't you?
Tom can't remember.
Let's check it out.
I worked with them.
I don't think Tom went to Boston.
Are you and Tom meeting?
You've been dreaming me for 100 years!

In a dog's four paws.
Tom's a little taller than Mary.
Tom plays volleyball well.
I gave it a chance.
You have to go.
I wanted to ask Tom for a favor.
A happy way.
Money doesn't grow on trees.

You seem smart.
You want to fly into space?

He's running now.
The guy drew a picture on the wall.
Can you use your lawn mower?
Do you believe the stars are guiding our valley?
He came home three hours later.
We're listening.
I want my phone back.
How many apples do you have?
Can I ask you a question?
Make sure they don't follow you.
She's got blue eyes.
This does not apply to the disciples.
I'll wait till tomorrow night.
Why are you doing this?
You know too much.
You don't want to sleep?
I don't know what it is.
Something's wrong with the helmets.
Tom told Mary that he liked her.
I'm walking.
Tom's avoiding me.
She's three years younger than he is.
I usually walk.
He's not a virtuoso.
Are you selective in food?
It's Tom who killed Mary's cat.
I'm sorry I can't go.
I went back fast.
He went to the store.
I hit him right and hard.
I'd like to know why you did this.
Where's the bathroom?
Let me help you with your luggage.
I have to find Tom.
What can I do for you?
I like your hair.
Put the book back in the bookshop.
We just got here.
I've just had a coma.
Do you like this jacket?
Are you still letting me do this?
Tom is waiting for the answer.
Tom and Mary are coming to the party?
Please call him.
It's a little house, but it's gonna come up.
You can answer the questions.

You speak Danish?
Tom's not like me.
Fire's gone.
Children should be fed.
He's my teacher.
We're playing with our guests.
Only Mary came.
I catch fish almost every day.
I'm still planning on doing this.
I'd like to pay, please.
I'll tell her you're here.
Tom is not Aunt Mary.
They're not yours, are they?
Mom's playing tennis right now.
Who do you live with?
When I got back, my car was gone.
Tom doesn't think he can do it on his own.
She went to the station to spend it.
This wind is the sign of the storm approaching.
I'm lost in the lab.
The girl standing there is Mary.
Don't admit it.
I love Christmas.
Here's my card.
I'm sorry I'm not playing guitar.
You have time.
Maybe you should talk to Tom.

Your bike is the same as I do.
I don't understand what the author's trying to say.
I know Tom's kind.
He went after the doctor.
Look at me when I talk to you, coward!
Your friend is amazing.
I think that's why we need to eat more.
I didn't expect Tom to be there.
Where does Tom learn?
Tom's upset about that.
The earth revolves around the sun.
Do you know whose car it is?
He's a big screwdriver.
Last night she slept for more than 10 hours.

Tom doesn't live alone.
No one believed me.
It doesn't matter how much you say it's your house, please stop walking naked.
The rain is over!
Have you read it completely?
We can do that.
It's not our only problem.
Ignore them.
You're going to the match?
I lost my glasses.
He's not my cousin.
Tom knocked at the door of the bathroom.
Give it an answer.
Do you really think Tom and Mary are safe?
It's a book.
We want to help.
I was born in October.
Tom's confused.
I don't give a shit.
Tom can wait.
I think it's time for me to get out of this mess.
There's a lot of monkeys on the mountain.
I like bourbon.
We'll start tomorrow morning.
I'll give you one more chance.
I know you want to be a doctor.
Unfortunately, she's missing.
I admire you.
You know what that is?
There's a secret passage.
I live in a cave.
I spent three thousand yen on a new compact disc.
Shut up and listen!

It's a sentence.
I need to charge the phone.
Did you see Tom this morning?
She just said it out of her class.
Tom confessed to killing Mary.
Could you call Tom?
Tom's working on Mary?
I didn't tell them that.
What bed do you want to use?
Be healthy!
You're obviously right.
Aren't you getting nervous?
I'm from North America.
Tom and Mary are done?
Everyone says I look like a father.
It's a small village.
We don't forget.
I pulled the moustache.
She advised him to stop drinking.
It was a quiet night.
I'm being harassed by soldiers for social justice.
I'll get education at home.
I don't think that's why I didn't want to be here today.
You told me that.
Tom lives in Boston?
She's weak enough to talk.
That's why I gave the key.
How many turtles do they live?
What did you get?
He's a political machinator.
Go get me another beer.

I don't want to talk.
Aren't you coming back tomorrow?
Can I count on you to be here tomorrow at the time?
Does that make any sense?
Tom's very pleased.
Where do we start?

This is not very important.
I'm done.
Don't leave me here.
So who?
Why is Tom so stubborn?
Today at school, I was ridiculed.
Tom knows the city very well.

So it is good to talk about others.

Who's your favorite writer?
I can't do this alone.
I love difficult tasks.

She's got two cats, one white, one black.
This flag is very beautiful.

I'm straight.
You should eat slower.
I hate milk.
I'm not a penguin.
Tom decided to marry Mary.
I wanted to impress Tom.
No, Tom, I'm not going to marry you!
Where were you hiding?
You're crazy.
Were you at the doctor's?
I found a very nice place today.
He tried to stop his anger.
No one came with me.
Get out of the street.
You have no reason to complain about anything.
You think Tom would do it that way?
You extravert.
He's a Georgian.
Mary put on a pencil.
I'm waiting for 2:30.
Tom didn't tell Mary why she didn't like her.
I knew Tom would be the winner.
Do it in a row.
They say she loves him.
Have you ever seen a whale?
Don't go anywhere.
I want to be a mechanic.
He likes to play football.
You think of Tom?
What can you do for Tom?
Are you not making progress?
I'm sorry, I love you.
In my soup hair.
You don't eat meat?
I go to church every day.
I don't want her to know about it.
I don't want to dance right now.
Time and circumstances bring wisdom.
Tom's not a teenager.
The twins hit the garden.
I remember the first time.
Tom talked to you about Mary?
You don't have a chance.
She doesn't want to wait for you.
I ate a doll.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
Are you my cousin?
Tell him to be careful.
You're dirty.
Tom doesn't want to wear a ginsy.
I'll go get them.
Luckily, no one was hurt.
Some say I'm unpredictable.
What a mess!
He heard a cry for help.
Didn't you hear the scream?
Flying is fun.
You couldn't call a doctor, please.
Do you know the sign language?
Tom's sunglasses are still on the table.
I'll stay here until you come back.
He rejected this idea.
That's ridiculous.
I wore my coat.
I think Tom's gonna be upset.
Tom said he was hoping you'd be at the party.
I'll make you some coffee.
Tom gave you something for me?
I have wine.
He sells shoes.
You're beautiful too.
Tom's been trying to contact you for a few days.
Do you believe in eternal life?
Poets write poems.
I think Tom's sorry about Mary.
He does not care about his children.
He's buying in the river.
It seems that Tom and Mary have it all right.
Mary says in her sleep.
I went to the bank.
Tom has no tea.
Look at us.
Who kissed you?
I'm not getting married to Suzie.
We're better than you.
You don't have to be nervous about these little things.
You're an asshole.
Is that you?
Please call the doctor!
I'm too busy to go.
Find someone else.
Do you have a professional experience?
Is that the only decision?
They're not sure they did that.
It's going to be very difficult to do that.
She's ours.
I decided to free myself.
Can we turn off the TV?
Don't you remember Tom?
Have you ever cut a sheep?
You don't like it?
So, what are you suggesting?
I never went to America.
I don't want to die.
We just found a murder weapon.
I'm waiting for your help.
Do not type this blue button.
Did Tom get in touch with you?
"This boy, he's such a hunter," said Mary.
He once loved her.
He loves football.
Birthdays are important.
Here's your key.
You don't like bathing?
What time can you come?
Tom says he expects Mary to do it.
Take off that ball.
Tom's trying to figure out what to do with him.
Is that a good news?
We're not hungry yet.
You see the boat, Tom?
Tom doesn't do everything in his power.
I'm sure you'll find a good job.
You're a fool.
Tom doesn't trust the police.
Perhaps this world is a hell of a different planet.
He grabbed the butterfly by holding it between his big and instructive fingers.
It's delicious.
Women are so strange!
I've already looked at this idea.
Tom hit my head.
Is there anything I can do?
I can jump on the cliffs.
Do what they tell you.
I'm looking for you.
Some didn't want to fight.
You know why Tom doesn't drink?
His book inspired me.
I don't think Tom will come back.
I measured the hat.
Tom's getting older.
Tom said I had a terrible look.
I had a little argument with Tom.
"When will you return?" "All depends on the weather"
I'm a golomosis?
It's a Scottish name.
Is there a hot dog butterboard?
Thank you for yesterday.
Don't you see that's why you need your help?
I'm not a soldier.
Tom's wife told me he's not home.
So I bought a watch.
I didn't say anything.
Don't hit me.
Tom usually wears a tie.
The man who helped me was Tom.
I'm going upstairs.
Dog's name is Ken.
I was just.
When did I tell the truth?
I think Tom's a friend.
We didn't have much time.
I like to play cards.
He's a joke.
What's the computer?
I'm not illiterate.
Did you sing yourself?
What are you doing?
Tom decided to do it.
Your drugs are ready.
I thought you were interested.
Well, every one of them, right?
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep.
Tom's alive.
I was nervous.
Tom has changed his job recently.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
Tom was upset.
She was a foreigner, and she was treated like a foreigner.
Karen went there alone.
Am I getting upset?
The girl we saw waiting for someone at Tom’s house is Mary.
Why don't you quit smoking?
We all make mistakes.
He wondered why his wife had left him.
I think I put too much sugar on it.
Do you know how to jump in the cages?
I know how to do this.
Did Tom come?
I don't need to cook dinner tonight.
I have something to say.
The hotel can accommodate 300 people.
That's why I broke the pie.
She can ask questions and answer them.
Tom said he had an alibi.
Tom has two friends.
What's Tom doing in Boston?
Tom didn't think Mary would want to do that.
Tom and Mary said they were not sick.
I've got a lot of time.
One more, please.
I'm a member of the team.
I had a stroke last year.
Mom's busy preparing dinner.
Horses are useful animals.
Come back quickly.
He's incompetent.
Fooma's been training.
He's impatient.
He's sure it's a test.
Tom was voting for the proposal.
Tom told you how long it took him to do that?
Let's get started!
Attention!
I'm completely exhausted.
Perspectives are not too bright.
I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I'm impressed by the literary song of the devil.
I'm afraid she doesn't have enough experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary named their child John.
I wonder if Tom would actually go to Mary's concert.
Tom said he did the last exits with this?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us to sing.
Let's not do anything at all.
Tom wants his father buried next to his mother.
You think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution to the problem.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm Di-Jay.
I hate Christmas.
Was it enough money?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It costs too much.
The child is lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to stop.
We're all right.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows many.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're losing.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
He's talking.
The air sphere’s surface is a non-euclideous space, so it does not comply with the euclidean geometry rules.
The talks were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I tried to call you.
I never killed anyone.
Be honest and straight.
Hope is always there.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice my age.
The journalist was stolen by terrorists.
I let go of the ball.
I hate this city.
He lives in Tokyo now.
The programming language is his hobby.
I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How much do you have in the watchhouse?
Tom is deaf.
So it's not like eating fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom is writing to you very much.
Your doctor says you'll be all right.
You're a cop.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need this money.
My orange tie.
Tom's gonna cry?
That's why it's supposed to be higher.
I have to help Mom.
His book inspired me.
You guys?
It's not my idea.
You have a plan, right?
He's playing.
Tom's not in town.
I had my shoes on.
The next year will be worse.
Mary in the yellow dress.
It's a bitter taste in love.
It's over.
You had to do it last year.
I didn't think I could do that.
I've got an old machine.
We understand why.
I eat every year.
I felt helpless.
I like the teacher.
They went to the elevator.
Tom is a professional hockey player.
We went to the woods looking for insects.
These are so different.
I saw her a week ago.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
Maternal love is greater than anything else.
He persecuted a thief.
I worked at the restaurant.
I'm not strong enough.
It won't be as boring as you think.
He accidentally put salt in his cup of coffee.
Tom forgot to tell you.
I'm interested in music.
I don't really want to eat right now.
The mirrors were torn to pieces on the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a beautiful car!
She went to school.
Tom was sitting next to the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom, I don't think I have to do this.
State debt is rising.
Why am I me, not you?
Tom will probably never do that.
It's a doll.
Save yourself!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is right now.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widow.
I read this story in a book.
Tom still got a bike?
Talk to me in a short time.
Tom is smarter.
It was a difficult night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could do that.
I'm a teacher.
You had a good time, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do it.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time on the Internet.
You're wonderful.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't spend it.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's leaving in 30 minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car.
We can talk.
The computer can count very quickly.
You don't have to.
I'm sorry, can I open the window?
What's the weather?
I'm thirty years old.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
Would you like some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for lunch today?
You can't even swappers.
Are people still using webcams?
I wonder if Tom had ever asked Mary why she left school.
It's a word borrowed from Greek.
Am I going to die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
He's sick.
Don't worry.
The car's outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost her money.
There are no rules.
Leila was pregnant very quickly.
He's not lying.
Do you know how to make salad from raw fish?
Tom knew what Mary knew.
Tom's cooking breakfast.
There is no doubt that the rain will come.
Tom didn't mention Australia.
Clearly, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
We actually drove to Boston.
In Iceland many volcanoes.
John is older than me for two years.
For better or worse, television has changed the world.
I'm a little fat.
He answered my questions easily.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He's probably innocent.
I love kids.
Who's left?
When is she coming?
It's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm so glad I did it yesterday.
Tom's still living next to you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you often meet him?
You'd like that.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She has wine.
You're gonna stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was two thousand years ago.
Tom's probably gonna take care of it.
It must be the right color.
Tom's got a very strict mom.
After a short peace, the war was relaunched.
It's better not to trust that.
Just talk to Tom.
May I remind you of your promise?
The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What's the name of this restaurant?
I'm sorry, couldn't you hand me the sugar?
Where exactly does Tom plan to build his house?
"Where's my notebook?" "On the table."
I don't think there's gonna be any problems.
Tom broke up?
You need to step up.
Green suits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary plays soccer.
How does it work?
You're very creative.
Hurry up, boys.
I'm fixin' the bastard.
When does his return take place?
I had a good rest.
He's no better than his sister.
Tom beats Mary.
I'm making too many mistakes.
He's not afraid of death.
It would be good if there were 28 hours at the time, wouldn't it?
Kobe is the city where I was born.
He would like this disaster not to happen.
We don't expect victory.
I don't have any money.
I don't teach here anymore.
We didn't find the boy.
Get on the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
That's why I need to call.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a dejay.
Soon Tom will learn to swim.
What's wrong with the way I did it?
They can catch fish.
Tom came out of the room.
I'm still doing this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom teaches French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thinks he can do it.
I don't have a book.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job is very boring.
He, so to speak, is a workman.
Answer the question!
You need to go to the hospital.
I can't find any backups.
It's a fraud.
It wasn't Tom who asked Mary to do that.
He's got green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom is often mistaken.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true that Tom was never in Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, there was a Gran-Pro broadcast.
Tom's a daughter.
Don't remember.
I'm rich.
Have you considered amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do it.
I don't speak English.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm hungry?
I'm too rich.
What's the girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
Therefore, do not do that again.
They live here for ten years.
Tom ran into Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of her children until she is gone.
I'm cooking right now.
Did you see Tom's passport?
You want to dance?
He's often late.
Do you remember that summer when Tom bit his head?
Why did Tom do that?
I know this girl's father.
This is my third marriage.
Tom can't go with us.
I picked up thirty points.
If I don't, Tom will be mad.
Aren't you a psychologist?
Don't you write that down?
The big tree fell on the road, and when I was going, it made my way.
I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold that shines.
I don't have a lot of friends.
Do you believe in the existence of a God?
I live in Boston.
Tom's blind since he was born.
He didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Aren't you getting bored?
What do you like about men?
Why are people still burning?
I'm not working on you.
I can do this for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, and he's not.
I was trying to do that.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son new shoes.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister Sakiko, who was born the same year that I was, and now she's preparing for the exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Did you get your homework?
Monday might be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you should help, so paint the park.
Why do humans act like giant monkeys, and on the contrary?
Can you help me?
Mudak.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go to the doctor.
I put the documents on the visa.
It's snowing today.
She kept working.
The moustache broke when we got up on the mountain.
Tom's driving.
If you ate less hamburgers, you'd probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Mary's not coming, is she?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to go to the hospital.
I had to go personally.
Please show me how this is done.
Don't you meet anyone?
All the benches are busy.
I haven't made my decision yet.
What date is it today?
Where's Dad?
Shut the door.
I'm not going to talk to Tom in French.
The apple does not fall far from the apple.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
Grandfather is your father’s brother or mother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She's got red eyes.
They're not coming back.
I was in the gins.
I'll see you after the show.
I'd like to ask you a question.
It's my grandmother.
It's a whale.
This bag of mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined Satan’s church.
I still want to do this with you.
Tom doesn't have any money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
You don't mind?
I haven't seen you forever.
You're obviously right.
Whose books?
That's what you want to do, isn't it?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom plays the dog twice a day.
Let me take a look at Tom's book.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sikoku, Honsu, and Kusu.
You're probably very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
I think we should go now.
We didn't.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I'm not gonna help you.
Get out of here.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare him to a tennis player.
Who asked you?
When did you get that?
She committed suicide.
We've equipped our office with computers.
We have to pay in due time.
Are you sure?
You think Tom's gonna die?
Aren't you planning on staying?
I didn't do what you blamed me for.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to get my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it right away.
Let's sing the song together.
Tom has three more books than I do.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing boots.
You can count on me.
His book became the subject of criticism.
That'll be great.
I'm really scared.
You have to help her, and fast!
That's a lot worse.
I'm under the fly.
You didn't waste your time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom was a witness in Mary’s case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
Can you ask what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What do we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You have to quit smoking.
I think Tom's cheating.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Can you play the script?
Can you give me some salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks French well.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
It was popular among both students and teachers.
You can't help with the tears of grief.
Tom's playing football and running.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet with Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom can't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung his earpiece.
I'll be right back.
The church is located at the bottom of the mountains.
Where's your assistant?
Why did I do that to you?
I'll have coffee, please.
Tom is trying to convince Mary to do this.
Tom's calling you.
You have to tell him to do it.
He's talking to an espresso with a little French accent.
It's not yours.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't do it.
She's got nice manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom comes to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a lady's lawyer.
I'll deal with it.
Have you found any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a magician?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Let's go.
So you're gonna let me move with you?
You're a nice woman.
Hope is there.
When I was a child, I was very shy.
Did he actually move to Boston?
Tom extended Mary’s beer.
How did you know Tom wasn't gonna be here?
Children grow up so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He came back to the hotel.
When did you get back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
Language conveys the idea of being in harmony with the rules of their language, even without being aware of them.
Tom on vacation.
What if I press this button?
The hunters drew their guns on the elephant.
Nobody cares.
They tried.
Tom and Mary still here?
Tom’s wife is Canadian.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary were unable to help me do that.
I'd like to take the money.
I pressed Tom's hand.
They're gonna be okay.
Half of these apples are nuts.
Tom's no longer a member of this club.
You don't have to worry about tomorrow's exam.
Tom was voting?
I'll be right back.
Tom won't force Mary to do that.
Tom didn't even start.
Instead of going to school, he stayed home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the park.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You don't have to trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
Don't run away from you.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where'd you take the canycles?
This year, did you receive a Christmas gift from Tom?
I'm still a little bored about the house, and so many things seem strange to me.
I sometimes have problems with memory.
Where's Mom?
He was awake three hours after the accident.
You speak Macedonian?
You don't have to talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Is Tom all right?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know why?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks in three foreign languages.
Tom's a little out of the chart.
Tom's not a hero.
Could you catch a cab here?
You're going to be late.
It's going to be difficult.
Is Tom always acting like that?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk that loud.
Our team needs your help.
You'll never leave.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It's working, you'll see.
She threw it away.
Tom's safe.
I finally got the water rights.
I'm not a student.
That's why Mary was sorry.
I'm just looking at the news right now.
Tom keeps checking the phone.
How's your wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom's not rich, Mary's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite handle.
Everyone's late, except me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I don't plan on blowing up the boat.
Money won't move.
Tom's got a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed with your efficiency.
Didn't you have a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you learning?
I'm sorry I ate those bones.
Good morning.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She totally ignores me.
Tom's going to the dance tonight.
I was talking.
She went to the airport.
She studies Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this was going to happen?
What's up?
If a natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, it can be compared to a plastic tree that was created artificially.
They all wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's in Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a nice garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you just did your job.
We'll take the walk.
Tom said what just happened?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
You said 'cause I was joking?
So it was awfully boring.
Tom said I was nice.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
They suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Bring out the trash.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have Boston's card?
Your sister's always great.
This will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed with fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How terrible!
Are you hurrying?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him at work, you should take his youth into account.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
That's his point of view.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom came out of the room reluctantly.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe it.
I was in a white dress.
Check again.
Tom has a doctor's son.
I know it's not going to be possible.
Do you have any major pain?
Children imitate friends, not parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play with friends outside.
Whatever happens, keep calm.
Tom sent Mary a message.
He's always happy.
When Mary arrived at the bus stop, the last bus was gone.
Tom's in the black coat today.
I'll wait till 2:30.
Tom is my baby.
We usually spoke French.
Bananas are delicious.
They're eating.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they're useless.
You tried to talk to them?
Doing so was much harder than it seemed.
Her friends laughed at her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I said.
I doubt Tom can win.
Inoplanetians fly and take our jobs, land for land!
Don't worry.
Bell found his phone in 1876.
Are you going on a train?
Tom said Mary was nice.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still sleeping, aren't they?
So he still likes Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad, and he didn't come back.
Get your toys together.
Doing so was much harder than it seemed.
I think I got it wrong.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I'm getting better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why it's interesting.
Have you finished your job?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's not easy to do that.
Tom's gone.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but higher than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the butterboats.
I never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was difficult.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I still wanted to sell it.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would.
You missed something.
That's why I called right away.
You looked interested.
That'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I love her.
We really don't have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to reach his goal.
Ken's two cats.
I realized what was wrong with me.
I love traveling.
The phone's not working.
That's what we want.
Tom in the sunglasses.
Tom's making a good picture.
All you need to do is click on the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can you take a suit for Halloween?
Tom's busy and he can't help you right now.
We don't have money.
He wants to see you as a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm getting hot.
Why don't you sleep?
Does Tom really think that someone is listening?
You don't have to!
Tom, you can say, nice.
Anyway, I disagree with you.
I had to go before.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is that solar energy is too much of a road.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's got a heart attack.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
Do you understand?
Tom wasn't rude with me.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
She's asleep.
Tom’s wife asked him to quit his job.
You couldn't open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This table is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted the orphan.
I played baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got a free ticket.
You're such an impatient man.
What's going on here?
Tom said you speak French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, it's worthless.
I am very interested in studying French.
It's getting good on the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a lamp that I could borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm glad you're satisfied with your job.
You're working around somewhere?
You admit it, don't you?
I have things tomorrow.
I'm in a hurry.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I don't usually understand.
I'm sharing everything.
The options are obvious.
The only person Tom is talking about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was canceled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom's okay.
I'm having a bad sleep.
Don't you get it?
Women are beautiful.
Wouldn't it be great if Tom did it?
Did you do that?
I'm having trouble sleeping.
Tom sometimes hates me.
I'm dancing pretty good.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.
It's obvious that you're going to have to spend the night with us.
He doesn't even watch TV.
I never said no.
There's already a subway in Rio.
Are you ready to help us?
Tom is a rare bastard.

I saw her that week.
The robot's out of control.

That's an exception.
Are you still homeless?
We had no control at all.
I thought that's why I didn't like it.
He grew up as a great scientist.

Go to hell, both of you!
You think it's my fault?
So I helped open the box.
This fox must have sucked the chicken.
I wonder if Tom's angry or not.
I have less money than you have.
Tom told Mary that he was planning to do it.
I can't answer your question.
You can't swim, can you?
Tom stopped the timer.
We didn't see Tom's face.
That was a great comment.
You're Tom's friend, right?
She speaks English well.
I'm not going to answer that question.

Your names have been drawn from the list.
You're so central to Tom, aren't you?
They don't respect you.
Thank you for your cooperation.
I'll answer any of your questions.

He doesn't care what others say.
Tom took a ball.
Why is life so complicated?
Some people are very tense.
I don't know how many years that's why.
Mary was the only girl in the club.
It's a complicated problem.
Mary's at work, isn't she?
I told him to speak French.
Tom is a teacher, isn't he?
Tom's surprised.
I tried to help you.
I didn't try.
No one's gonna take me to work.
Don't you want to have kids?
Tea without ice.
Philosophy is not a thing that can be learned in six months.
You want to take off the weight?
Tom thought no one was watching.
My father's too busy to go for a walk.
This place should be visited twice.
I'm just going for a walk.
He sells cars.
They were my friends.
I found something very interesting.
I'm not afraid of your dog.
Did you live here?
Maybe Tom's tired.
I don't think we can do that.
Tell me because I'll call you back.
We'll try.
Tom shared Mary’s pain.
They're tired of playing.
I can't forget her smile.
I hope Tom didn't do what you asked him to do.
I don't like fish.
I'm not the kind of person I'm giving up.
I feel tired.
I have food.
Mary asked Tom to let her drive.
Tom’s justification was pathetic.
Warsaw's cheaper than London?
I'm ashamed of my bad English.
Are you hungry?
How did you get out of prison?
You can't bring anything.
You're successful.
I have a sea pig.
You've got a blue loss.
Who were you dancing with?
Thank you. I jumped all six files.
Tom died of tuberculosis in 2013.
Good job!
My whale is so sweet.
I like cake.
He looks exhausted.
Look, here's your train coming.
This is my watch.
What are you looking for?
Life is beautiful.
It wasn't easy.
Do you like chocolate milk?
You're a ghost?
You have restored my faith to mankind.
How's your mother?
He doesn't believe in evolution.
I hurt my back.
Where did you work last year?
Your secret will be safe with me.
I'd be very proud of you.
He came personally.
I really want to eat.
Tom died in the same year as Mary.
We went to the street.
I think exams suck up education.
Very cold.
That's why you came back from Boston, right?
Did Tom believe that?
Actually, he was never in New York.
Tom thought that Mary and John might be involved in arms smuggling.
I was sober then.
Here's your hand.
Tom was waiting for Mary.
Rio de Janeiro was founded in 1565.
I'm going to Boston with Tom.
I don't think you can do that.
First, you have to understand yourself.
I was there yesterday.
I'll wait here until he comes.
Tom has the ability to drive.
I'm reading the novels of intent.
I was going to say that, but I forgot.
I'm a heroine.
They love us.
I need your help very much.
Tom betrayed you.
I got up about six.
I don't want to boast, but I'm pretty smart.
Does that matter?
Can I get you a minute?
Tom may not even get to the team.
I wonder if that's why you can trust me.
What's wrong with her?
Do you drink?
I was angry.
When did he get here?
Where's your dirty bear?
How's it going, Tom?
Perhaps this year we will finally win the European Cup.
Where could Tom do that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm careful.
Do you have a passport?
I tried to forget my wallet.
Cats catch a mouse.
You can go.
Tom said he didn't mind doing this for Mary.
Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I made Tom do it.
Which wonder would Tom want to do that?
Birds can see the magnetic field of the Earth with their eyes.
You need a car?
It's Tom's signature.
What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
Don't come in, I'm naked.
Are you planning on doing this?
Am I clear?
I'm free today.
Tom is probably punished for what he did.
In spite of nothing, Tom is happy.
There's no need to rush.
Are you satisfied?
At first, I didn't believe him.
The phone's not working right now.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Get inside.
Tom can pay if he does.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
It's really crazy.
Tom is my older brother.
Tom told Mary that he saw John in January.
You always get up early, don't you?
She always opposes herself.
They live in the same state.
My dog follows me wherever I go.
Thank you for your help.
Tom said he didn't want to die.
I wouldn't do that in your place.
Tom's already in French.
The earth passed from father to son.
There's no rabbits without snakes.
I hope it's not them.
Don't drink too much, okay?
Wait for a surprise tonight.
You'll never be alone.
Why should we not do so?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I like watching TV.
He left the family.
Let's go?
You don't have to get in touch with Tom.
I'm stuck.
I'm the boss.
Tom's gone wrong.
You have to go home by 9 o'clock.
Tom and Mary danced all night.
Tom admitted he did.
Tom can't drive.
Tom spent that day with his daughter.
Each disciple has his own port.
We were ready.
I'm worried about what they can do to me in court.
My family lives here.
Tom's listening.
It came out of my hand.
Tom speaks French well.
I know I've learned a lot.
I went fishing on Monday.
Mary loved her dog.
The party's over.
The unicycle has one wheel.
"Daddy, look there, shark!" "It's a whale, Tom."
I know you're hiding something.
People always say I'm very friendly.
I'm a botanist.
I think Tom knows something.
It was my fault, not Tom.
The congregations have gone far enough.
This time of year, the wind is blowing from the ocean.
I saw Tom smile.
Goida, let's go!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned that.
Go and kill this hooligan.
This is our car.
Hi, I'm Bashir!
Tom bought Mary a rose.
I'm ashamed I did.
Should I go to the hospital?
In her free time, she makes dolls.
I think Tom's singing the country music better than any of my acquaintances.
He's drinking a moderate amount of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She doesn't care how she's dressed.
Did you see his new movie?
I'm good at it.
Why did he get rid of it?
Tom said Mary was gone.
I don't have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My unpredicted thought is that it's a terrible movie.
You're very elegant.
As you wish.
I could change.
It's important.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
She's with Tom.
Tom was a Bosnian.
I did everything I could.
If you see an error, please correct it.
We tried again, but it didn't work out.

I'm not sure if it's ready to do that.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
You have to help her.
You don't cry when you cry.
He did his homework on his own.
It was a hot day.
I need a vacation.
We want to get to that mountain.
Tom missed lunch.
You speak English well.
He loved his parents.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do that?
I hope you'll come back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love cannot be bought.
If you didn't want to come, you should have said something.
I'm ready to work.
What's this theater?
Did you see the protein?
Mary told her that Tom had told her.
Tom was not a very good witness.
I visited my grandmother.
I hate marriage.
I heard the front door burst.
I'm not following you.
Mary's dancing is great.
My grandfather from Osaka.
I want a massage, I need to relax.
Tom's such a lucky guy.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Did you sleep?
I was very sincere.
I'm not sure who did it.
What do you think, when Tom's here?
Is the snow going to be tonight?
Is that what it's gonna do to you?
You're meeting someone here?
I live in Milan.
When did she do something for me?
I ate orange.
The square root of two is an irrational number.
He's small.
Didn't you know it was going to happen?
Bad thoughts give birth to bad actions.
Did you bring the fan?
Tom's not wrong.
Do you have a gift from this store?
Tom seems a little embarrassed.
We can't run without water.
I can't think about it.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in the village.
I'd never give up.
I speak French freely.
Tom wasn't wasting his time.
I want you to encourage me.
You're disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He drank a lot.
Tom says he's happy.
How do you feel now?
How many boys in your class?
It's a big apple.
Choose a gift carefully.
I'm going with her.
Why would you do something similar?
The richest man in the world could not buy his love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new tires.
The absence of the news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers will save us time.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You were in London three times.
I'll be right back.
Tom didn't see you.
I'm walking slow.
After the film, they fell asleep.
I started coughing.
We'll get married in June.
I wonder if Tom left Boston.
I dropped my bones.
The book lacked a number of pages.
I picked up the coin.
I have to go to the meeting.
Tom never violates his promises.
We need to protect ourselves.
You know that Jamal and Sarah don't have much to do with each other.
Every student has his own port.
I spent twelve hours.
I'm still gonna hurt about it.
I'm not sure Tom is telling the truth.
It's not your business.
Don't go.
Tom has no effort.
I learned to eat cows.
I'm thirsty.
I'm sorry I'm not rich.
The news really upset her.
I've got a lot of time.
With the New Year!
You'll see it on your own.
I never killed anyone.
What's your name like?
She's holding flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him yet?
We're used to it.
I'm nine years old.
This coffee is so hot that I can't drink it.
Where did you get that?
Are we done?
You from Boston?
Did You Know It Since 1990?
You're doing well, aren't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I take your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom's special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She's got red blood.
What happened?
I owe you ten bucks.
Listening to music is my favorite way of rest.
We were ready to attack.
When is the celebration?
Did you help?
Are you a cop?
Tom did nothing of what we told him to do.
You didn't see him.
I know Tom told us the truth.
Tom heard that Mary was married.
I've learned a lot.
How much does this parasol cost?
They were both intertwined.
What happened?
It's possible.
Tom thinks Mary's exhausted.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Everyone in Tom's class was infected with flu.
Remember the first time you heard Beatles?
Did I hurt Tom?
I want you to come to my party.
No toilet paper.
Word is silver, silence is gold.
Please sit here and wait.
I love this football.
Drink water from the stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I moved last month.
Tom, he'll probably still be mad.
I'm going to the airport.
Don't take it for granted.
I'm glad Tom will help us.
Tom's gonna be here for a minute.
I'm glad they're both on our team.
Where can we sit?
You like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How much time does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see you again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I invited her to a party.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you get to China?
Do you approve of what Tom's doing?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
It's an ideal opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do it.
I don't expect them to win.
I slept.
How is this my fault?
As for Switzerland, have you been driving a winter there?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It's getting better.
I'm studying Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay the loan.
Try to look at it from Tom's point of view.
The window has been opened.
No one thinks so.
I took my shoes off.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You'll be happy.
Tom had a pretty sick look when I saw him last.
Tom's still dating Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I usually work from the ninth to the fifth.
Let me handle this with you.
Mary watched a romantic comedy.
Get him!
Someone knocked at Tom's door.
Tom's such a fool.
You want some more potatoes?
Tom sat down.
Tom has a nose.
I have three questions for you.
I met Tom several times.
Are you using a text processor?
Tom and Mary do a lot together.
Please move.
What are you doing tonight?
Why did you paint a red cap?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French freely, right?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
You can't speak French, right?
You're not.
Let's go home.
I greeted Tom.
Tom took off his lunch.
I'll arrange breakfast for you.
Tom was listening.
Who broke this window?
Your ideas are a little old.
