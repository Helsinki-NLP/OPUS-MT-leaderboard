Is he really married to Mary?
Do you still have him?
Do you love silk?
I knew they'd suspect her.
He cut through his pants.
Don't die, please!
Who won?
What very arguments can you use to help us?
Would they do that?
He's my friend.
Are you ready for the exam?
All your friends will be there.
It's Tom's fault.
I'd do it if you didn't stop me.
The problem is you.
I know math very well.
Don't worry about it!
I thought Tom had a good plan.
These doors won't open.
She speaks Chinese.
Your presence here means a lot to me.
Slow down, please.
Let's make a cake.
We are satisfied with the decision.

I'm confused.
In popular culture, the phrase "Alla Abar" has become almost synonymous with terrorism.
I'm very hungry.
I fucked up your mouth and your city.
Maybe you'll meet him.
It's my fault, not yours.
Maybe Tom broke the car.
Don't panic!
It's very loud here.
I hope you're not afraid.
I thought it was true.
Tom may have borrowed money he needed from someone else.
Can you just do it now?
Why did you do that?

The plan works.
I don't need a job.
I'm just a girl.
Tom was extremely angry.
I'd like to live in Boston.
Aren't you mad at Tom?
I think you should ignore Tom's replica.
You look confused.

That's what we think.
I didn't forget.
I like your shirt.
What nice tits they are!
Keep your promises.
I'll have dinner at 4:00 a.m.

For personal reasons.

Tom's avoiding me.
She's three years younger than he is.
I usually walk.
He's not a virtuoso.
Are you selective in food?
It's Tom who killed Mary's cat.
I'm sorry I can't go.
I went back fast.
He went to the store.
I hit him right and hard.
I'd like to know why you did this.
Where's the bathroom?
Let me help you with your luggage.
I have to find Tom.
What can I do for you?
I like your hair.
Put the book back in the bookshop.

Tom is not Aunt Mary.
They're not yours, are they?
Mom's playing tennis right now.
Who do you live with?
When I got back, my car was gone.
Tom doesn't think he can do it on his own.

I'm lost in the lab.
The girl standing there is Mary.
Don't admit it.

Ignore them.
You're going to the match?

Give it an answer.
Do you really think Tom and Mary are safe?
It's a book.
We want to help.

Where were you hiding?
You're crazy.
Were you at the doctor's?
I found a very nice place today.
He tried to stop his anger.
No one came with me.
Get out of the street.
You have no reason to complain about anything.
You think Tom would do it that way?
You extravert.
He's a Georgian.
Mary put on a pencil.
I'm waiting for 2:30.

I don't want her to know about it.
I don't want to dance right now.
Time and circumstances bring wisdom.

The twins hit the garden.
I remember the first time.
Tom talked to you about Mary?
You don't have a chance.
She doesn't want to wait for you.
I ate a doll.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
Are you my cousin?
Tell him to be careful.
You're dirty.
Tom doesn't want to wear a ginsy.
I'll go get them.
Luckily, no one was hurt.
Some say I'm unpredictable.
What a mess!
He heard a cry for help.
Didn't you hear the scream?
Flying is fun.
You couldn't call a doctor, please.
Do you know the sign language?
Tom's sunglasses are still on the table.
I'll stay here until you come back.
He rejected this idea.
That's ridiculous.
I wore my coat.
I think Tom's gonna be upset.
Tom said he was hoping you'd be at the party.
I'll make you some coffee.
Tom gave you something for me?
I have wine.
He sells shoes.
You're beautiful too.
Tom's been trying to contact you for a few days.
Do you believe in eternal life?
Poets write poems.
I think Tom's sorry about Mary.

He's buying in the river.
It seems that Tom and Mary have it all right.
Mary says in her sleep.
I went to the bank.
Tom has no tea.
Look at us.
Who kissed you?
I'm not getting married to Suzie.
We're better than you.
You don't have to be nervous about these little things.
You're an asshole.
Is that you?
Please call the doctor!
I'm too busy to go.
Find someone else.
Do you have a professional experience?
Is that the only decision?
They're not sure they did that.
It's going to be very difficult to do that.
She's ours.
I decided to free myself.
Can we turn off the TV?
Don't you remember Tom?
Have you ever cut a sheep?
You don't like it?
So, what are you suggesting?
I never went to America.
I don't want to die.
We just found a murder weapon.

He once loved her.
He loves football.
Birthdays are important.
Here's your key.
You don't like bathing?
What time can you come?
Tom says he expects Mary to do it.
Take off that ball.
Tom's trying to figure out what to do with him.
Is that a good news?
We're not hungry yet.
You see the boat, Tom?
Tom doesn't do everything in his power.
I'm sure you'll find a good job.
You're a fool.
Tom doesn't trust the police.
Perhaps this world is a hell of a different planet.
He grabbed the butterfly by holding it between his big and instructive fingers.
It's delicious.
Women are so strange!
I've already looked at this idea.
Tom hit my head.
Is there anything I can do?
I can jump on the cliffs.
Do what they tell you.
I'm looking for you.
Some didn't want to fight.
You know why Tom doesn't drink?
His book inspired me.
I don't think Tom will come back.
I measured the hat.

So I bought a watch.
I didn't say anything.
Don't hit me.
Tom usually wears a tie.
The man who helped me was Tom.
I'm going upstairs.
Dog's name is Ken.
I was just.
When did I tell the truth?
I think Tom's a friend.
We didn't have much time.
I like to play cards.
He's a joke.
What's the computer?
I'm not illiterate.
Did you sing yourself?
What are you doing?
Tom decided to do it.
Your drugs are ready.
I thought you were interested.
Well, every one of them, right?
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep.
Tom's alive.
I was nervous.
Tom has changed his job recently.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
Tom was upset.
She was a foreigner, and she was treated like a foreigner.
Karen went there alone.
Am I getting upset?
The girl we saw waiting for someone at Tomâ€™s house is Mary.
Why don't you quit smoking?
We all make mistakes.
He wondered why his wife had left him.
I think I put too much sugar on it.
Do you know how to jump in the cages?
I know how to do this.
Did Tom come?
I don't need to cook dinner tonight.
I have something to say.
The hotel can accommodate 300 people.
That's why I broke the pie.
She can ask questions and answer them.
Tom said he had an alibi.
Tom has two friends.
What's Tom doing in Boston?
Tom didn't think Mary would want to do that.

I've got a lot of time.
One more, please.

Horses are useful animals.
Come back quickly.
He's incompetent.
Fooma's been training.
He's impatient.
He's sure it's a test.
Tom was voting for the proposal.
Tom told you how long it took him to do that?
Let's get started!
Attention!
I'm completely exhausted.
Perspectives are not too bright.
I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I'm impressed by the literary song of the devil.
I'm afraid she doesn't have enough experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary named their child John.
I wonder if Tom would actually go to Mary's concert.
Tom said he did the last exits with this?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us to sing.
Let's not do anything at all.
Tom wants his father buried next to his mother.
You think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution to the problem.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm Di-Jay.
I hate Christmas.
Was it enough money?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It costs too much.
The child is lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to stop.
We're all right.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows many.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're losing.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
He's talking.
The air sphereâ€™s surface is a non-euclideous space, so it does not comply with the euclidean geometry rules.
The talks were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I tried to call you.
I never killed anyone.
Be honest and straight.
Hope is always there.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice my age.
The journalist was stolen by terrorists.
I let go of the ball.
I hate this city.
He lives in Tokyo now.
The programming language is his hobby.
I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How much do you have in the watchhouse?
Tom is deaf.
So it's not like eating fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom is writing to you very much.
Your doctor says you'll be all right.
You're a cop.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need this money.
My orange tie.
Tom's gonna cry?
That's why it's supposed to be higher.
I have to help Mom.
His book inspired me.
You guys?
It's not my idea.
You have a plan, right?
He's playing.
Tom's not in town.
I had my shoes on.
The next year will be worse.
Mary in the yellow dress.
It's a bitter taste in love.
It's over.
You had to do it last year.
I didn't think I could do that.
I've got an old machine.
We understand why.
I eat every year.
I felt helpless.
I like the teacher.
They went to the elevator.

You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a beautiful car!
She went to school.
Tom was sitting next to the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom, I don't think I have to do this.
State debt is rising.
Why am I me, not you?
Tom will probably never do that.
It's a doll.
Save yourself!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is right now.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widow.
I read this story in a book.
Tom still got a bike?
Talk to me in a short time.
Tom is smarter.
It was a difficult night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could do that.
I'm a teacher.
You had a good time, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do it.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time on the Internet.
You're wonderful.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't spend it.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's leaving in 30 minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car.
We can talk.
The computer can count very quickly.
You don't have to.
I'm sorry, can I open the window?
What's the weather?
I'm thirty years old.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
Would you like some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for lunch today?
You can't even swappers.
Are people still using webcams?
I wonder if Tom had ever asked Mary why she left school.
It's a word borrowed from Greek.
Am I going to die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
He's sick.
Don't worry.
The car's outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.

There are no rules.

John is older than me for two years.
For better or worse, television has changed the world.
I'm a little fat.
He answered my questions easily.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He's probably innocent.
I love kids.
Who's left?
When is she coming?
It's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm so glad I did it yesterday.
Tom's still living next to you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you often meet him?
You'd like that.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She has wine.
You're gonna stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was two thousand years ago.
Tom's probably gonna take care of it.
It must be the right color.
Tom's got a very strict mom.
After a short peace, the war was relaunched.

What's the name of this restaurant?
I'm sorry, couldn't you hand me the sugar?

"Where's my notebook?" "On the table."
I don't think there's gonna be any problems.
Tom broke up?
You need to step up.
Green suits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary plays soccer.

We don't expect victory.
I don't have any money.
I don't teach here anymore.
We didn't find the boy.
Get on the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
That's why I need to call.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a dejay.
Soon Tom will learn to swim.
What's wrong with the way I did it?
They can catch fish.

I'm still doing this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.

I don't have a book.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job is very boring.
He, so to speak, is a workman.
Answer the question!
You need to go to the hospital.
I can't find any backups.
It's a fraud.
It wasn't Tom who asked Mary to do that.
He's got green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom is often mistaken.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true that Tom was never in Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, there was a Gran-Pro broadcast.
Tom's a daughter.
Don't remember.
I'm rich.
Have you considered amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do it.
I don't speak English.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm hungry?
I'm too rich.
What's the girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
Therefore, do not do that again.

He didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Aren't you getting bored?
What do you like about men?
Why are people still burning?
I'm not working on you.
I can do this for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, and he's not.
I was trying to do that.

Quiet, please.
I bought my son new shoes.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister Sakiko, who was born the same year that I was, and now she's preparing for the exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Did you get your homework?
Monday might be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you should help, so paint the park.

What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to go to the hospital.
I had to go personally.
Please show me how this is done.
Don't you meet anyone?
All the benches are busy.
I haven't made my decision yet.
What date is it today?
Where's Dad?
Shut the door.
I'm not going to talk to Tom in French.
The apple does not fall far from the apple.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?

Do you know whose parents they are?
She's got red eyes.
They're not coming back.
I was in the gins.
I'll see you after the show.
I'd like to ask you a question.
It's my grandmother.
It's a whale.
This bag of mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined Satanâ€™s church.
I still want to do this with you.
Tom doesn't have any money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
You don't mind?
I haven't seen you forever.
You're obviously right.
Whose books?
That's what you want to do, isn't it?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom plays the dog twice a day.
Let me take a look at Tom's book.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sikoku, Honsu, and Kusu.

You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I'm not gonna help you.
Get out of here.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare him to a tennis player.
Who asked you?
When did you get that?
She committed suicide.
We've equipped our office with computers.
We have to pay in due time.
Are you sure?
You think Tom's gonna die?
Aren't you planning on staying?
I didn't do what you blamed me for.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to get my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it right away.
Let's sing the song together.
Tom has three more books than I do.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing boots.
You can count on me.
His book became the subject of criticism.
That'll be great.
I'm really scared.
You have to help her, and fast!
That's a lot worse.
I'm under the fly.
You didn't waste your time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom was a witness in Maryâ€™s case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
Can you ask what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What do we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You have to quit smoking.

You don't look like her at all.
Can you play the script?
Can you give me some salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks French well.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
It was popular among both students and teachers.
You can't help with the tears of grief.
Tom's playing football and running.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet with Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom can't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung his earpiece.
I'll be right back.
The church is located at the bottom of the mountains.
Where's your assistant?
Why did I do that to you?
I'll have coffee, please.
Tom is trying to convince Mary to do this.
Tom's calling you.
You have to tell him to do it.
He's talking to an espresso with a little French accent.
It's not yours.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't do it.
She's got nice manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom comes to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a lady's lawyer.
I'll deal with it.
Have you found any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a magician?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Let's go.
So you're gonna let me move with you?
You're a nice woman.
Hope is there.
When I was a child, I was very shy.
Did he actually move to Boston?
Tom extended Maryâ€™s beer.
How did you know Tom wasn't gonna be here?
Children grow up so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.

Nobody cares.
They tried.

Tomâ€™s wife is Canadian.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary were unable to help me do that.
I'd like to take the money.
I pressed Tom's hand.
They're gonna be okay.

Tom didn't even start.
Instead of going to school, he stayed home.

I'm sorry I went there.
You don't have to trust her.

Tom still wants to come.
Don't run away from you.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where'd you take the canycles?
This year, did you receive a Christmas gift from Tom?
I'm still a little bored about the house, and so many things seem strange to me.
I sometimes have problems with memory.
Where's Mom?
He was awake three hours after the accident.
You speak Macedonian?
You don't have to talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Is Tom all right?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know why?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks in three foreign languages.
Tom's a little out of the chart.
Tom's not a hero.
Could you catch a cab here?
You're going to be late.
It's going to be difficult.
Is Tom always acting like that?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk that loud.
Our team needs your help.
You'll never leave.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It's working, you'll see.
She threw it away.
Tom's safe.
I finally got the water rights.
I'm not a student.
That's why Mary was sorry.
I'm just looking at the news right now.
Tom keeps checking the phone.
How's your wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom's not rich, Mary's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite handle.
Everyone's late, except me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I don't plan on blowing up the boat.
Money won't move.
Tom's got a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed with your efficiency.
Didn't you have a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you learning?
I'm sorry I ate those bones.
Good morning.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She totally ignores me.
Tom's going to the dance tonight.
I was talking.
She went to the airport.
She studies Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this was going to happen?
What's up?
If a natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, it can be compared to a plastic tree that was created artificially.
They all wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's in Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a nice garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you just did your job.
We'll take the walk.
Tom said what just happened?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
You said 'cause I was joking?
So it was awfully boring.
Tom said I was nice.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
They suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Bring out the trash.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have Boston's card?
Your sister's always great.
This will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed with fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How terrible!
Are you hurrying?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him at work, you should take his youth into account.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
That's his point of view.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom came out of the room reluctantly.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe it.
I was in a white dress.
Check again.
Tom has a doctor's son.
I know it's not going to be possible.
Do you have any major pain?
Children imitate friends, not parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play with friends outside.
Whatever happens, keep calm.
Tom sent Mary a message.
He's always happy.
When Mary arrived at the bus stop, the last bus was gone.
Tom's in the black coat today.
I'll wait till 2:30.
Tom is my baby.
We usually spoke French.
Bananas are delicious.
They're eating.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they're useless.
You tried to talk to them?
Doing so was much harder than it seemed.
Her friends laughed at her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I said.
I doubt Tom can win.
Inoplanetians fly and take our jobs, land for land!
Don't worry.
Bell found his phone in 1876.
Are you going on a train?
Tom said Mary was nice.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still sleeping, aren't they?
So he still likes Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad, and he didn't come back.
Get your toys together.
Doing so was much harder than it seemed.
I think I got it wrong.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I'm getting better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why it's interesting.
Have you finished your job?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's not easy to do that.
Tom's gone.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but higher than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the butterboats.
I never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was difficult.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I still wanted to sell it.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would.
You missed something.
That's why I called right away.
You looked interested.
That'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I love her.
We really don't have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to reach his goal.
Ken's two cats.
I realized what was wrong with me.
I love traveling.
The phone's not working.
That's what we want.
Tom in the sunglasses.
Tom's making a good picture.
All you need to do is click on the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can you take a suit for Halloween?
Tom's busy and he can't help you right now.
We don't have money.
He wants to see you as a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm getting hot.
Why don't you sleep?
Does Tom really think that someone is listening?
You don't have to!
Tom, you can say, nice.
Anyway, I disagree with you.
I had to go before.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is that solar energy is too much of a road.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's got a heart attack.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
Do you understand?
Tom wasn't rude with me.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
She's asleep.
Tomâ€™s wife asked him to quit his job.
You couldn't open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This table is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted the orphan.
I played baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got a free ticket.
You're such an impatient man.
What's going on here?
Tom said you speak French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, it's worthless.
I am very interested in studying French.
It's getting good on the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a lamp that I could borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm glad you're satisfied with your job.
You're working around somewhere?
You admit it, don't you?
I have things tomorrow.
I'm in a hurry.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I don't usually understand.
I'm sharing everything.
The options are obvious.
The only person Tom is talking about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was canceled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom's okay.
I'm having a bad sleep.
Don't you get it?
Women are beautiful.
Wouldn't it be great if Tom did it?
Did you do that?
I'm having trouble sleeping.
Tom sometimes hates me.
I'm dancing pretty good.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.
It's obvious that you're going to have to spend the night with us.
He doesn't even watch TV.
I never said no.
There's already a subway in Rio.

Why is life so complicated?
Some people are very tense.
I don't know how many years that's why.
Mary was the only girl in the club.
It's a complicated problem.
Mary's at work, isn't she?

Tea without ice.
Philosophy is not a thing that can be learned in six months.

He sells cars.
They were my friends.
I found something very interesting.
I'm not afraid of your dog.
Did you live here?
Maybe Tom's tired.
I don't think we can do that.
Tell me because I'll call you back.
We'll try.
Tom shared Maryâ€™s pain.
They're tired of playing.
I can't forget her smile.
I hope Tom didn't do what you asked him to do.
I don't like fish.
I'm not the kind of person I'm giving up.
I feel tired.
I have food.
Mary asked Tom to let her drive.
Tomâ€™s justification was pathetic.
Warsaw's cheaper than London?

Tom has the ability to drive.
I'm reading the novels of intent.
I was going to say that, but I forgot.
I'm a heroine.
They love us.
I need your help very much.
Tom betrayed you.
I got up about six.
I don't want to boast, but I'm pretty smart.
Does that matter?
Can I get you a minute?
Tom may not even get to the team.
I wonder if that's why you can trust me.
What's wrong with her?
Do you drink?
I was angry.
When did he get here?
Where's your dirty bear?
How's it going, Tom?
Perhaps this year we will finally win the European Cup.

Oh, my God!
Don't come in, I'm naked.
Are you planning on doing this?
Am I clear?
I'm free today.
Tom is probably punished for what he did.
In spite of nothing, Tom is happy.
There's no need to rush.
Are you satisfied?
At first, I didn't believe him.
The phone's not working right now.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Get inside.
Tom can pay if he does.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
It's really crazy.
Tom is my older brother.

Wait for a surprise tonight.

Why should we not do so?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I like watching TV.

People always say I'm very friendly.
I'm a botanist.
I think Tom knows something.
It was my fault, not Tom.
The congregations have gone far enough.
This time of year, the wind is blowing from the ocean.
I saw Tom smile.
Goida, let's go!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned that.
Go and kill this hooligan.

Hi, I'm Bashir!

I'm ashamed I did.
Should I go to the hospital?
In her free time, she makes dolls.

What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She doesn't care how she's dressed.
Did you see his new movie?
I'm good at it.
Why did he get rid of it?
Tom said Mary was gone.
I don't have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My unpredicted thought is that it's a terrible movie.
You're very elegant.
As you wish.
I could change.
It's important.

Let me talk to Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do that?
I hope you'll come back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love cannot be bought.
If you didn't want to come, you should have said something.
I'm ready to work.
What's this theater?
Did you see the protein?
Mary told her that Tom had told her.
Tom was not a very good witness.
I visited my grandmother.
I hate marriage.
I heard the front door burst.
I'm not following you.
Mary's dancing is great.
My grandfather from Osaka.
I want a massage, I need to relax.
Tom's such a lucky guy.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Did you sleep?

Is the snow going to be tonight?
Is that what it's gonna do to you?

We can't run without water.
I can't think about it.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in the village.
I'd never give up.

I'm going to work.
He drank a lot.
Tom says he's happy.
How do you feel now?
How many boys in your class?
It's a big apple.
Choose a gift carefully.
I'm going with her.
Why would you do something similar?
The richest man in the world could not buy his love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new tires.
The absence of the news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers will save us time.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You were in London three times.
I'll be right back.
Tom didn't see you.
I'm walking slow.
After the film, they fell asleep.
I started coughing.

With the New Year!

What's your name like?
She's holding flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him yet?
We're used to it.
I'm nine years old.
This coffee is so hot that I can't drink it.
Where did you get that?
Are we done?
You from Boston?
Did You Know It Since 1990?
You're doing well, aren't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I take your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom's special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She's got red blood.
What happened?
I owe you ten bucks.
Listening to music is my favorite way of rest.
We were ready to attack.
When is the celebration?
Did you help?
Are you a cop?

How much time does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see you again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I invited her to a party.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you get to China?
Do you approve of what Tom's doing?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
It's an ideal opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do it.
I don't expect them to win.
I slept.
How is this my fault?
As for Switzerland, have you been driving a winter there?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It's getting better.
I'm studying Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay the loan.
Try to look at it from Tom's point of view.
The window has been opened.
No one thinks so.
I took my shoes off.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You'll be happy.
Tom had a pretty sick look when I saw him last.

You can't speak French, right?
You're not.
Let's go home.
I greeted Tom.
Tom took off his lunch.
I'll arrange breakfast for you.
Tom was listening.
Who broke this window?
Your ideas are a little old.
