Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
As part of an amendment to criminal law, the Ukrainian Parliament rejected the draft annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the head of the opposition.
In second reading, Members rejected the draft amendment aimed at reducing the penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently in prison.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having concluded an unfavourable priority agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must decide on the appeal of the defendant in December.
Tymosenko has qualified the regime's political revenge and has led to a process of partiality of the court even to the west.
The draft cancel paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 Members.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Liberian Victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already won.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As is customary in the region, election winners are Islamists, but they are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the ordinary law of Charia and we already know what it is about.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a flight we cut hands.
Women can forget the emancipation, the possible non-respectives of her faith are passable from the capital punishment...
It is the Koran that will unite in place of the dictator's personality the society made up of opposing tribes.
In Libya, we will have such an order that we cannot represent it and that we would certainly not like it.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and it would probably not be beneficial for the Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamic warriors have accepted help with the recognition of unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not an American general who led NATO strikes, but rather Allah, whose greatness they celebrated at each attack.
So when it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West isn't part of it.
We have participated in the shootings, serve Islam and our politicians have turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any benefit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militaryly occupied by Libya.
So there's no problem for the premises to get rid of "crossed".
Is it not that oil companies will have easy access to the Libyan black gold without occupation of the soil?
Perhaps not so much as the West will finally be able to boast of uninterested protection of human rights.
Let's not let these cariac people stop us from doing that.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the eyes of investors.
A tornado of statistics happened on Tuesday on Europe.
Each state has published relevant GDP information for 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The mandatory market beats all records.
Investors not only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The offices of statistics in the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries published their economic development visions for the third quarter earlier.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, that of France by 0.4%.
Both countries have modified the data for the second quarter in which Germany is better placed than expected (growth of 0.3 per cent instead of 0.1 per cent expected), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (it was the question of the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent during the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that it is directed towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
Results are worse than analyst forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy had a growth of 0.5 per cent in the third quarter according to the estimated and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, corresponding to what the analysts had planned.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Ten-year performance is 28.45%
The performance of the obligations of Spain and Italy is now increasing to critical limits.
Problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
The performance of the Czech obligations is below 4 per cent, while the situation in the region is worsening.
Votes are heard in Germany to say that the ECB should be the guarantee of the last instance .
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won at Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The performance of the football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to Super Czech and Guardian Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football has also been very successful in its qualification in the second part and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a great deal of chance for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the super Czech and hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification at the European Championship.
Montenegrins were found under pressure until the second part due to a precise Czech defence.
The winners of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who had two chances of marking a goal.
And thanks to Super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent from the European Championship next year, and also a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
In the first few minutes, we played a football warrior.
The two teams were hard to get together and the game focused mainly on the central line.
The pressure of national footballers did not come to the attention of the Czech defence who responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half of the time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a human shield
A few hundred students from higher schools have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli assassination.
The students went to pray in the afternoon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Spain have created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology centre of Spain where uranium is transformed.
They thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has not ceased to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
A possible attack by Iranian nuclear institutions is reported in Israel.
The students went to pray in the afternoon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose objective would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, targets would be not only Ispahan, but also Natanz's site where uranium is enriched.
The feeding of an obese child: take no breakfast and take from the charcuterie to eat it
Over one third of children 9-13 years of age have overweight problems, 9% of the children choose weight above average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families who have a bad lifestyle.
This again shows the importance of the environment in which the human being and the models surrounding it evolve.
On the obese children's tables there are, for example, 50% more charcuteria than in children's families with normal weight.
19% of the obese had fries to dinner according to the survey carried out with a awareness-raising action "The Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the small families, sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schoolchildren today - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and attended 900 primary schools in Chequie.
This was the second edition of "Obecity is not a coincidence", supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever Company.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from the sixth to the third have been enrolled in this project.
One of the determinants that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children in overweight, or obese, is the lack of proper food and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children in question indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day for breakfast - breakfast - breakfast - dinner, which is a basic principle of good food," one of the results of the survey said.
No breakfast and breakfast at dinner
Experts draw attention to the fact that to have healthy development, some basic details are needed such as a small family lunch at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the families of students eat at the same time.
In most families each takes their breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been found is that a tenth of the population does not take all breakfast.
However, breakfast is the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in the obese children's families, there were more frequent consumption of malnourished fries.
Almost every student - without talking about weight - drinks every day of sugary drinks (70%).
More than 40% of the children in question do sports regularly, but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare for your meal
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from the possibilities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from the ideal for healthy food."
Among their favorite dishes are many dishes, meats and sugars.
"The most alarming is, in particular, a great preference for sugar lemonades," is indicated in the results of the investigation.
To eat it, these are the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
Children did not want any feculent and the preference for fish and vegetable food was very low.
Head of Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of a review of a group of participants in the survey who had filled the questionnaire after the awareness meeting, "Obesity is not a coincidence," the survey reported the results.
The most significant was, for example, with regard to sweet lemonades because children began giving preference to drinking water.
The children had the most frequently stored white meat and fish on the questionnaire as the main dish and would reduce the sweet dishes and the "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread flour or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for the stylists, I was a little angry at the fact that there was a lot of it from the beginning.
I didn't think about what was going to happen next.
The exhibits of three professionals in the specialty, the dress of the characters and a seminar on what is going on.
And it'll be worse.
We are closer to final reviews and are more waiting for practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses Saturdays and Sundays, it's really "bought."
This time we have with Director Alenka (there is no boy in the course) dealt with how to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women of this kind are the majority.
One has a small tail, the other a boy's body, without a particular curve, another of the superweight.
The stylist must know how to visually reduce wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus come to highlight the character beautifully, and also not to dress too prominently of women's types such as Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine size.
For example, if there is a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that the skirts or pants do not go all the way, it is worth measuring.
And you won't regret it because the dress that falls is unestimated.
In a measure jacket you will feel much better than in the one that slips constantly, wraps around and does not hold to the belt and so on.
For those who have a male look, a tucker-style dress can be allowed, with piece of fabric worn, or even embroidery.
There are, of course, many examples of different apparitions and I am glad that I have all week to select all the information I have received.
But I'm afraid you're also afraid of what I have to do at home too.
Each trainee receives a celebrity to dress for the day and the evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality and its appearance.
I'm going to have to "dress"Miranda Kerr, maybe you know the secret of Victoria from the campaign.
At the bottom of me, it makes me happy, because it's better than wearing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who took almost 100 pounds these last time (don't take my statement, svp, completely serious) or the young Selena Gomez.
We must cut and cut from magazines or search the Internet, print and work on graphics.
The Moodboard, as it is said for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with the graphic creation.
Meditating also on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress the physical but creates, for example, the productive pages in the magazines (on products given trends for handbags, blankets, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a stylisticist and graphicist, has kept us from all this.
But this... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three special guests gave a diverse view of the Saturday meeting with information on the different types of persons.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist can work with one dress differently.
The variability is for this primary example.
For example, this coat-shirt that has to be treated in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat, but it can also dress the naked body, with scarfs and take it in a picture as a dress.
Or it's enough to lift the sleeves or neck and have a new look right away.
"Play with that" he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then begin to oppose it," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with, what to do, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion performances.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben, the stylist must have a lot more clothing variants than those that are photographed.
That is, for a story fashion that will have a dozen pages (i.e. a dozen models) I have to be ready to "retail" at least one fifteen.
Also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to deal with this in the course of a model creation.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing made it a global star.
In Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylistic services is still cold.
And the familiar faces sometimes view them as useless (it's enough that I know something but what I look like goes to the second rank).
And if someone makes a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he tells us with a great probability of a completely different size (lesser) than what he actually has.
Then we just navigate on Google and make sure that the Boulevard information tells us about the celebrity in question, whether it has left or big, etc.
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to focus on fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he wears, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing how to get people, not to flirt, not to keep their opinion.
"When a manager asks you to choose his armor and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything away and tell him, "My God, how terrible."
"You'll find some things that you'll find beautiful and he'll advise you on what to wear," says Mario.
He has specifically shown us what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or stylistic bag.
It's the one you hang around the size and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to things clearly defined as chairs, depilation rolls, or even food spikes, there is also the nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which a garment is closed in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of agraph are not usable because they could wear the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we are not only people who listen but who have tried something in a practical way they have taught us how to look properly like shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the seed could fall to the ground, to the fortiori to the left.
And that's how we got caught and picked up.
We did not have the right to touch the scars so as not to harm ourselves by inadvertently.
Thus, there is a real need for skills.
Mario made me happy when he congratulated me on my creation.
The account I'm making is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second week of the course
I'm starting to understand that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed Le Run disputes across America.
Revision
Initially, a problem-free race is transformed by a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift to work.
It fills everyone's ambition to some extent, but it's useless if no one wants to do something more.
The new sub-title The Run produced great expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the racing series Need for Speed already old and to get out a sort of game from the playable parts that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how the passages will be ravished during which the main hero comes out of his car and does what he wants.
As already in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole pull down due to some unnecessary errors that have already existed for several years.
These are not really errors, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible pheasant on the part of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are involved in the adventure that the main hero Jack has and to solve them is involved in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to get first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than 50 courses.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the steps planned in different environments that distinguish each other quite well and are interesting.
The player doesn't feel the only moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are quite beautiful, even though the graphic technical level is the same as the previous series.
It's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in high snowy mountains is very pleasantly visible.
The tests are also being approved in time of an atypical element.
For example in the desert you will find yourself in a sand storm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
In addition, the different courses are well organized behind each other.
There's only a small number, but that's enough.
There are moments when you try to surpass the requested number of opponents (like in a classic race) then you run against the watch (classical duel with the chronometer) and then wait for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who come into the game and try to make you the difficult situation.
Novelty is out of the vehicle.
It's an interactive animation when most of Jack's time gets angry at someone and you have to help him by taping the right button at the right time.
It's not complicated.
What is surprising is that there are less times of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
As a result, it is as good as this because this element is not likely to generate and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that approve the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that there is nothing extraordinary at present but it cannot be said that it is negative.
With regard to realistic simulation, you will have to go elsewhere.
But even if you can find a better way to compete, the model of conduct goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collisions are not yet at the point.
We don't expect this game to be a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don't have a collision with any object, the least idea of how your car behaves, it's not completely good.
During closed crossings you sometimes interact with each other slightly but otherwise your car part in crazy volts.
Or he's in the middle.
It's not really a problem, but it really bothers you.
The reminder is made so that when you break the figure or you get out in the decor the game brings you back at the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 recollections.
When you have used the 5 reminders you have to restart the game from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, in case something doesn't happen as it should, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes the recollections do not help, and the solution needs to be found by recalling the part of the route in question.
The big pit of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that need to be passed in a certain way if this is not the case.
Otherwise you will meet on a given location of "civil" vehicles in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute in delay.
What makes you angry is the situations when you see the enemy easily passing between two cars coming in reverse direction and when you arrive, you either have to stand side by side and twist them or slow them down.
It's the same if you go ahead of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always gets close to your nose.
The opponents still have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent as you do in the same place.
This upsets the most at the end of the game when you roll on a long bridge in reverse sense.
The opponent must pass before you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in reverse direction and you collapse a lot of times.
It can be understood that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you are quickly upset.
And it's bad because through a simple behavior model the game is interesting and the places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it's the same if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there's no way to get bored or something else.
The original idea is to change the car during the race.
You need to be careful about the essential pumps on the routes because you can change cars there, however, most of the time you have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylindrical cars for the right highways and super sports cars for exotic actors on very technical routes, for example on lacquer roads in the mountains.
And the way of challenges, which are races in particular places you know about the adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you reach the highest driver level, different objects begin to unfold:
It connects online with the Autolog function that compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult hits to understand is the situation of the latest adventure race.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you roll in the darkness on the roads (it looks like).
Your speed indicator indicates you between 150 and 200 km/h (priority) and behind you comes a subway branch that sends you the car directly to the railway.
In writing we have had a discussion for a few days to know whether someone really thought about when creating this game or whether the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is ghastly is that in more extreme situations, the picture does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This is especially true of accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid image is no longer used for you.
The sound part is good and the track is on the choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the young public a new soundtrack has been created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it's about the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game makes it feel like it's not over.
The fun is really good, but prepare to get the wrongs in your eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.
Students of velvet in concert with the choices of Charles University
The Festa Academy Festival offers for the third time festivals that connect the International Student Day with the anniversary of the velour revolution with a musical part.
During the festival there are 20 high schools and secondary classes.

"The Charles University has an important part in this festival."
"Some of the choices there is the Choir of the Faculty of Education and Humanities, in the committee of the festival is chaired by Rector Vaclav Hamp", says the head of the organizer team Jakub Calou.
The festival's cloud is the concert of the Choeur des lycées and secondary classes that takes place with free entry on 17 November from 2 p.m. on the space in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
In the program there is the composition of the Czech jazzman well known Karel Ruzicka, Celebration Jazz mass.

The programme also offers high-level concerts, medical meetings, student walks and other activities.
The interested will find all information on the website of the festival www.festacademica.cz.
Vice-President, Ambassador to the European Union:
The Czechs act as negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically abolished the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect a war so hard."
"This will take 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," said Miléna Vicenova, who started his presentation at the Faculty of Law at the Czech Embassy near the European Union.
When she was able to describe the various bodies of the EU and their relations in such an understandable and visible way that a large number of Members of the Charles University Faculty of Law could send the letter, she showed how much she took her motto "understanding and openly about Europe" to be serious.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticisms that he is faded, that he cannot fulfill any mission, and I must say that he has cut the blow to the whole world because he holds his role to perfection."
"It is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and have a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in response to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "What phone number should I call?", so as an important step towards the unity and greater legitimacy of the Union's state policy, such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid us from our syrecky (skin-frog which feels very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda she has lived, lived and will live in close proximity to the European Council.
She qualified the Czech Presidency two years ago.
The Czechs resolved the financial crisis, the gas crisis, or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She qualified for the fall of very negative governance and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is now very busy.
According to Madame l'Embassadrice, "the activity has fought its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve now.
The new seventh budget of the Union, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation, must also be approved.
As it would seem that the budget will be thin and for savings, what sector will be the priority, which countries will be the least helped, everything is to be resolved in future negotiations.
Madame the Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandingable Europe".
"I really don't like the abbreviations, the foreign words, the jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that no one in Brussels makes round or round corners, or bananas are quite big or even that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky."
It wants to make better use of the EU's environment and see more Czechs in European institutions.
A Europe at a number of speeds awaits us
According to the Embassy, the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspects more than positive.
It is also sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault results, according to it, from several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, it then highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak, the French say to me, 'Hey, what are you doing down there, what are you doing in this Visegrad group?' and it's not very happy."
In the near future, according to Madame Vicenova, these are new tough budgetary policy rules that await the member countries.
It is the concept of a Europe at two speeds, if it is not at several speeds, which presupposes rather than a 'new European Federation'.
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institution for enhanced cooperation."
First, it was said that the countries that wanted it and those who didn't want it remained in their corner."
"There will be many institutes of this kind and there will be a really two-speed Europe," awaits Madame Vicenova.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the bases on which all the themes having an impact on the EU must be discussed between all EU members and not only the members of the euro area.
History of a brand:
IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the vocabulary that best expresses the IBM strategy, the closest one would be "the long term".
For a large audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a strong feeling as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The basis for this long-term strategy was issued by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved for a little while so that people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE!" became the printing press that will develop the life of a future giant (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was the basis of the company's culture of care developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years because it remains faithful to its basic values and yet has not been afraid to change everyone else around it.
This has enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will wait even more"for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano took a further step.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, took care of his employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were the only one of the first American employees to have paid holidays, an insurance paid by the employer more an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and traders.
In the same way IBM has a well-developed relationship system with the customer.
The company was at the very beginning in the discovery of talents - as one of the first firmes to eliminate all forms of discrimination and could thus have a choice.
The current plan is fully in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman - Virginia Rometti - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
It has been working at IBM for thirty years and currently holds the position of Chief of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years IBM has done what is called jamy, online brainstorming from what are many future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that provides it with a secure position in the business areas.
"Since the beginning IBM had an institution rather than a technological firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Economy Professor at Harvard Economics School and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technological firm but a firm that helps solve business world problems by using its technology," Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research added.
As the firm itself said, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Grande Bleue", as it calls the United States as a family in terms of its slogan - has grown up to become one of the world's largest firmes.
It is, of course, the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, accommodation, advice services at the server's product level to nanotechnology.
It has many patents from all American technology firms and five of its employees received a Nobel prize.
Among its discoveries are the ticket distributor, payment card, financial swap, bar code or floppy.
IBM found itself this year with $220 billion the second largest technological firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded in 1996 Microsoft.

This is not all the innovations and manufactures that have preferred the client and the time - IBM for example has failed to peer into an OS/2 own operating system, the Prodige online service or either the IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the forward movement you can't emotionally stay focused on the past," notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this, IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don't work it goes on.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft competitor who bases and remains under the Windows operating system.
A prospective technology
In IBM incomes, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
In 1990, however, it was with more than the strongest participation of the hardware representative.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets for $15 billion, during this period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continues to invest and even from 2008, when it first exceeded the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who has also increased its investment volume during the great economic crisis.
Did IBM now seem to pass the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM action has increased from 2008 to 120 per cent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The logo of the firm IBM is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect this flexible giant to be able to control other crises.
IBM History: From cheese strips to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name Computing Tableling Recording Corporation.
It was named IBM in 1924 - originally a brand used by a firm's branch in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 1980s of the ninth century.
They had technologies such as the old "points", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who presided over the Society's Supervisory Board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then made a shadow to the founder of the firm - it's about Watson's ideas that so far rely on the identity and culture of society.
Watson was leading the firm since 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - cheese and meat rags up to registered boxes.
During the first four years of Watson’s leadership, business figures increased to $9 million and began to expand the firm in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of management it was his son who took on the manager's staff, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers of IBM assisted NASA to guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sells its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but buys the company of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and starts to take care of advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded in IBM in the last three years - is the concept of Smarter Planet "a smarter planet".
Its objective is to smartly exploit technology in areas that have not yet been exploited, such as the transport and management of cities.
In terms of trade IBM has recently developed a "Smarter Commerce" platform that helps businesses manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in our territory as well.
It created its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is located in Prague, and there is also a global research and development team dealing with the recognition of the word.
Richtarova about her unfaithful husband:
If you can keep this monkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtarova (53 years) said, it's over!
After his husband Joseph Richtar (53 years old) became a bodyguard and a lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from her rose dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner" explained Richtarova.
When Darina Richtarova gave asylum in the summer at Bartosova in her home, she had no doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta insists after 30 days on moving from Ricany, Pepa does not give up the singer.
And he publicly acknowledged that he loved her.
With Darina's time he resigned, accepted her husband's bond and ended up saying goodbye to her forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Richtar and Bartosova separate, there will be no wife to welcome her on the steps of the door of the house.
"It's my son's biological father and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost an old ane, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," he left it to filter Rightarova by showing that she has separated from her husband but that they only remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change."
"My wife put in place a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I'm dealing with repairs, garden, real estate, I'm buying."
"With Darina we discuss perfectly normal but we don't sleep together" said Richtar for Blesk.
If Richtarova finds a new love, he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes, with who and if she has a connection.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take full responsibility for myself," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Does this concern you too?
If you ask men to determine the typical vices of women, all, like each other, are able to get them out of their pockets.
My dear ladies, you will meet in the following lines of the women's vices who come to pump the blood of the men's veins.
Purchases
Your half makes you notice that you're dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one dress a week?
Are you happy to buy packages at the time of the balances?
In your case, we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think that they should restrict their passion for making purchases.
But you'll say, which would resist the vitrine lacquer of clothing shops, to look for yourself of beautiful clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women to buy is a hobby, it can become a real hell for men.
Just remember how many times you told your mate he was waiting for the entrance...
Dissatisfied
"I'm not too big"?
"I would need to chew at least 5 kilos - should I start sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't those phrases remind you of something?
Yeah?
So you're part of these women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop worrying about yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is still complaining about her appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints increases and that women become poisonous.
Odour and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite handle.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum, clean the floor, clean the dust, wash the bathroom - and that's twice a week.
Do you notice to your partner that he walks with salt feet on his own ground, to the children that they have taken out the washbasin, scratched the glass of the living room, and what does that give you a lot of work?
In case you are suffering from this obsession, try to remember that there is nothing to be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for property can spoil your relationships and even family peace.
The work of soap
"With this coating used in the garbage."
"Are you going to put those old shoes on tomorrow?"
"A wet servant has nothing to do with the ground."
If you do this know-how on your partner several times a day, you're really going to decompose it.
It's obvious that you don't think bad you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much soap...
Diffamation, persiflage
Diffamation, perversion, but also insults against someone are also the property of certain women.
Women are particularly involved in relations and thus are happy to deal with issues such as, where, with, with, how and why.
Maybe every one of us can escape a little harmless persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a particular feature of women.
But the worst are those who advise, perceive, even despise others and are for their environment - especially at work in a community of women - especially dangerous.
Jjar and Voracek helped with their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
The hockeyist Jjar has twice participated in Philadelphia's victory during the NHL Monday match on Caroline's ice and is again at the head of the competition-producing Czech players.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who still made a more pass and was named the best player of the game, he marked in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jjar also recorded two goals during the match.
Jjar after the match will tell the extra-Atlantic journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the match he'd give his hat-trick."
"I heard it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," explained Jjar after his action Giroux marks a goal of the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later, there was a second trial by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricane targets for the palette and presented it to the Butter Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belongs to the Flyers.
Especially in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagger he marks three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transforms a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league but he's really part of the best three," Jjar said about his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him."
"I'm really happy about that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years in the NHL the other players of the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jjar added.
Caroline made a play of this game because with a goal of Tuom Routu and again of Dwyer on a penalty shot it ends with a difference of purpose.
Matt Read has not distinguished other complications that end up two against one.
"Proger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He tapped on the pallet, I took the speed and (Read) left to the nearest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him, and I got there," said the final goal of the match from his point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory in the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not complete the match with Buffalo he came out on the second third because of a wound in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not face an experienced defender of their two fines lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
This is the fact that the rear line was sick who mainly embellished the local coach rather than lost points because they played the match only with 5 defenders.
"It's zero."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young people."
"But there's nothing to do, that's how it is," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement has not been sufficient and we have not been able to resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the palette out of our area."
For this we had limits," one of the defenders, P. K. Subban, added.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender took part in the 30th Winnipeg attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in eight goals of the Jets, which arrested a series of 5 lost matches.
How Travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sportist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel mainly in the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have a westerly inclination and travels to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not permitted for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovakians) to travel individually even within the socialist countries.
In the case where the Czechoslovakian citizen wanted to travel individually in Poland or in the Soviet Union, for example, he needed an invitation letter if the individual was not allowed to travel.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, however, it was necessary to take the whole night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" in the travel agency.
And even after that, it wasn't won yet.
The agreement for the currency that was the condition to travel west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the currency agreement (western currency) to travel west.
The Czechs spent most of their vacations in the country where there were many rural homes and chalets that the Czechs had bought, and this habit has so far been harsh.
Since 1989, Czech travel has been a major revolution.
Although up until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were maximum, the Czechs spent the last year abroad 4 million days of holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we do not know today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia of the time.
The elimination of visas in the 1990s in the neighbouring countries of the West caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially in Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not travel by plane to the west for a long time each wanted to see at least one moment.
For example, in Paris the travel organizations made the Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical trade of a Czech trip was at this time to bring with it its own preserved food, sauce, etc... to save.
Another important moment has also been the interchangeability of the Czech crown that allowed our tourists finally after decades of power to buy freely from the Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage increased what led to another important moment around 1997.
As a result of a growing demand for travel, travel agencies have since 1997 started to prepare tours with air charter connections that have significantly reduced the costs compared to what was before.
By the end of the 90s last century, the Czechs had no visas with practically most of the developed countries around the world, which later facilitated our journeys.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared for an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year of direct air charters, Czech tourists have been taking to distant warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period, symbolizing our post-revolution development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU deleted visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to move fully into the group of developed countries.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for holidays abroad, including the accompanying charges. Crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President, but it may end up with a situation without a solution "a pact"
Nearly 5 months already the Czech football is without a President and he risks that the successor of Ivan Hasek to the head of the Association of the Czech Republic Football is not yet known after a General Assembly to take place in Nymbork on Thursday.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting rules must be made.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Palik are interested in leading the Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and in the course of his departure called on his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that will lead the football in the future.
Only during the year after Hasek the football came back to differences between the rooms of the Association that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met informally in the National House in Prague because the negotiation was blocked and it was not even a matter of how to deal with the election.
There was no agreement on knowing who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, like, the statutory representatives or also the investment officials of full authority.
In this single point, there has been a partial agreement since now with the assistance of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences continue with regard to the electoral regulation.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which, in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has brought nothing to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the neurologic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the bed.
"The issue is whether to do according to the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three Vice-Presidents of the Association of the Football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, who represents the professional football in the Association.
According to the rules of the proposed model, the third round of candidates who will have received the highest percentage of votes in the room for which they are candidates shall be awarded.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw to win the candidate who will receive the largest percentage of the two rooms.
And the Czech party is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only then would it lose the idea of two previous rounds and would completely reject the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian party and who would best not change the regulation and vote in accordance with the existing statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Palik also agrees, even if he believes that the electoral regulation established by the statute benefits the most Pelta of all candidates.
"I wish to vote to the maximum in accordance with the statute of the Association."
"Because there are still no unclean ideas imagined by a representative as in the previous General Assemblys," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time and who, in his presentations, was particularly opposed to Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, Nymbork will have a new President and believes that candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualification today at the European Championship should calm everyone."
"The football will again be on a wave of happiness and there is more training for cooperation" adds Jablonec's officer who among the three has the greatest experience in the management of both professional and regional football.
Rachel is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are trends to want to change the drawing regulations."
"This can cause another blockade at the General Assembly."
"I hope the same as the healthy reason will win," said Rachel.
There is not much time left for a common agreement to all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro, but that can say whether the entire football leadership will be complete for the game.
The special flight in which the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rijkl were to travel to Podgorica, among other things, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the executive committee on the ground of reprisals.
Finally, it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Education for Youth and Sports Joseph Dobe would be very pleased to receive the parties that have disappeared from the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state-of-the-art staff, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sports, which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Palik is going to fight for the President's position because he does not see any right candidates.
If the leader of Plzen Tomas Palik's footballers had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to his request for a new Chairman of the Association of the Czech Republic's Football Association (AFRT) he would not be campaigned for this high function.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not present myself to the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Palik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Palik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta from accessing the AFRT head that would be given priority for this election.
Palik also points out that in the event that he would win the elections, he would hold this position as President only until 2013 scheduled for a General Assembly.
He will see a highly experienced and senior manager in the function but not related to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he said.
"For me, it was terrible when some people told me that they didn't want to be identified with the Czech football at the time."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
What is said, particularly Palik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Union of the football of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man of the controversial reputation known as the lobbyist who is able to influence the vote of delegates in the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to hold this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would stay and there would be nothing in football again."
"And with Berbr's support, which is a high-voltage dealer, it would be even less favourable to football," Palik proclaimed.
What is still shocking is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in the course of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta left without any punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA" says Palik, who said some time ago, "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the Plzen club."
In case Palik triumphs on Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rijkl, another candidate who had been supported by Palik before the General Assembly in September who had completed a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with."
"He's got great abilities."
"It would be possible, for example, to present itself as head of representation."
"But as the Association Manager it wouldn't be possible."
"I don't put the nose in what I don't know," said Palik, who in September drew great attention when he voted for the cancellation of the Arbitrators' Commission with Ludek Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Palik claims that he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private companies and that he has also been leading the Plzen club since last year, which celebrated with his support in May last his first division triumph.
"I have the strength to make a difference in the world of sport and to bring some culture to it."
"I would slow down the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, leading to situations of bad taste," Palik added, who did not claim to be antipathy for the Head of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose lobbying power from high-level policies would make it possible to obtain more money for the sport of gambling tax.
"This is one of the key points the new President should take care of."
"If this is the gambling tax, as the political parties have said, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money is going," he said.
Palik does not make his current connection to the Plzen club as something negative even if he himself claims that the President of the AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"That's not the ideal."
I can't see why I'm transferring my actions from the Plzen club to someone if I have to go back a year and a half," Palik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT which should put an end to the state of emergency.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of Football, one of the candidates to the presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, the AFRT would have new statutes that would put an end to the elections in the future.
The Jablonec official is before the Thursday meeting in Nymbork very optimistic and thinks that the success of the football performance today should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta, before the September election, which has not been held, has just promised to devote itself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if it is elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly passed, and this two-month delay could well enable him to defend his vision of the football leadership and to present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have played football for a long time and expect Thursday to have a President."
"They feel that it is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, has worked for many years in Sparta and the Union's Executive Committee.
This is also why he has enough experience to run the Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election there is an euphoria that ruled in the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly of Statutes were approved which were not perfect as they were all seen."
"If there had not been all these different interpretations, we would have had a President since September," said Pelta.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civil association that has taken all the attention of delegates.
"If I become a President, I take it as a personal mission and I am ready to take all the responsibilities if this does not work."
"It's a principle without which we can't exist," Pelta added.
Then he tries, we say, not to confront his opponents.
He stated earlier that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his legal training and that he knew that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice President.
He hasn't attacked Tonas Palik for a long time, who doesn't stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's evolved into football for a year and has already had some success."
"His attacks were, however, not the most honorable and surprised many during the campaign."
"That is also why some have doubts about his character now," Pelta said at the address of her opponent, but he said, faithful to the announcements he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest-level competitions to the national representation.
It's supposed to be a football vitreous.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that start with that of the Bohemians or the result of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we could get enough money for the whole football," the Czech press agency CTK declared the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment at the head of the football would lead to no change in people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he told Strahov, where he had a understandable nervousness since there was no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymbork for anything.
"If there is only one point on how to vote in the third round, we will be able to overcome it."
"The football needs credibility and it will only get it when there's a new leader at its head," as Pelta says optimistically two days before the most likely day for his career as a civil servant.
Rijkl promises that under his direction AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl was elected as the new President of the Association of the Czech Republic Football in the General Assembly on Thursday, this would not be a great deal of people, it would seem.
However, Rachel promises that in the case where he would be elected, we will start working hard.
He wanted systematic changes and made members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I want to take care of football in its entirety."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a performance football for youth."
"But I'm not saying that I'm going to do all this alone," said Rachel in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a specific area."
"And I'll distribute difficult missions to make football a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will start working hard rather than criticizing others" he added.
He said, it is said, that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"As for me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth it and if I have people behind me who will put me in the wheels and throw doubt on each of my actions," he explained why he hesitated.
"Many people have told me the same thing that I don't have to give up because they would give up too."
"It's a confidence I can't betray," he said.
What motivates him, we say, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"Since the last two years there's been a great deal of work and I don't want to let it fall."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would like only someone to stop them."' he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta, the situation within the Union does not come back as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and that's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
" Behind him are people who would make football in such a way that it would be only for those who were chosen."
"We can blame me for a number of things but certainly not for putting up with someone."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he again confirmed that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if anyone says otherwise, I'm ready to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts by one Czech and the other Moravian, the winner of which would be the first division."
"There would be no situation as at present with only three marble teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Palik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the President's position, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I constantly feel the support of the Czech House that has elected me as its Vice-President and knows that there will be success with me," said Rachel, who plans to save tens of millions of crowns among her future successes on unfavourable contracts, on negotiation of contracts with television and on the game law.
On the contrary, the fact that the Association is not united is a common mistake to all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Palik is a strong candidate who has what to offer at the football.
"No one can doubt Plzen that he did a great job this year."
"If he had been elected he would certainly continue in what had been started by Hasek and would not make a significant change among the people in the Commissions."
"He didn't want to waste his success," said Rachel, who evaluated his rivers.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
A Saddle in the Blue
De Julia Stanek
Ovni optics, beautiful Budapest swimming pools: Who travels across Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the city or making a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in a gas-water bath.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the best of well-being.
When Iris Meder was on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missing in his luggage: his bathroom.
Stretched on her back in the water, she observed the artisticly arranged domes, and was swimming against the Putten marbles that were waiting for her on the other side of the pool and was not missing to admire the Art New Metically restored from these converted pools.
If a covered pool pleased him, she noticed in her book all the details worthy of interest about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were investigated in this way by the Meder architecture history and presented them in its already published book: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain". The municipal pools of Munich, the historic bathrooms in the black forest, "Bethon Buildings Hardcore" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old Germany is a true fervor of the bath culture.
Meder, explains that she does not have much interest in sports, but she feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It is annoying that swimmers should be content to contemplate blue carriages and accommodate Javel's water pudding while the joggers breathe from the scent of the cave forests or can listen to the gasulously of the park's joyful birds.
"I was asked one day why the swimming pools should always be so loose," said the vinnoise.
"So I started a collection of beautiful bathrooms."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A swim in a pool and volatile sauna oils - a factor of well-being in the swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders were to give themselves a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight to their eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a water surface in the swimming rooms."
"It is on one side transparent, but reflects on the other side the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically double: high vocals, multicolored reels, tramplings.
The small image size "Badfreuden" makes a report worthy of 190 pages of interest on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly gives a desire to make a kiss in the blue.
The Meder collection has discovered remarkable examples during its research in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful well-being baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found nitrate-containing water in a natural cave in the karst (a cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a bath of spas whose pools are filled with water containing alcali and (Városio Termamáfürdö in Jászberény) and in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the heated pools in the air of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zürich bath we have the whole city in its eyes, we can admire the Arlberg surrounded by an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is furnished with a window from which we can observe the animation on the ski trail.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Langenfeld: The Water Dome Ötztal looks like an OVNI that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open platforms, while in the background the mountains of Otztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of Javel's water does not come from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths produce a smell of sulphur, of the Arpád-sppa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be in a health spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon glues you to the skin as soon as you let you slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool and in the air of Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded ground.
The bathroom designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in time.
By throwing a glance at the new red-white-jaun building window, she observed the expansion of the bad grass among the oaks.
She observed a different effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad's thermal palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it can be discovered not only from its design in 1844 but also from a mature Alhambra style hall that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bathroom of the expert in the pool, Iris Meder - and not just because it is the origin of Schwarzwald.
"It's already a great performance to lay down building styles so different in such a formidable unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, swimming in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculation
The German Bank examines in detail speculation on raw materials
De Christian Teevs
Does the German bank leave its speculation on raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to look for the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the group leader then wants to draw on the consequences.
Hamburg -
For citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks rely on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discount this business venture because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Force survey on the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of Stock Exchanges leads to higher prices and that banks share a complicity with the world famine.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically opposed to the chief of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act the same way.
The speculation on raw materials was originally introduced to protect the goods from price fluctuations.
However, the majority of experts share the view that the parents have withdrawn from the offer and have asked - and benefit from the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism of American competitors: He promised to investigate the complaints and said, "No case is worth taking into account the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the Foodwatch-Report accusations.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank's Board of Directors should be presented - with a recommendation, as usual.
At the end of January, the Bank's head will indicate the consequences to be achieved.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann Image Built-in
The Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on food price increases shows in a particularly draconian way, to what extent today's banks are damaging the general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be particularly required today.
"The Deutsche Bank must delete all the investments in its portfolio for which the money was invested on food speculation," Bode said.
"It matters little, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's a question of hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may appear to be surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the PDG of the group wants to present a perfect picture, a few months before leaving its function.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the President of the Board of Directors will not change anything within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with a abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And as for any loss, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One of the two would resolve the investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
To date, more than 30,000 netizens have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Mardi survey, with which the Forsa Institute carried out questionnaires to 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Just eleven per cent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which payments on food prices are made.
Many of the bank's clients would also be affected by personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such operations: one in two would, following the survey, resolve all the investments for which the money is injected into raw material speculation.
43 per cent of such banks would be disengaged, 49 per cent replied that they would reflect on the resolution of their accounts to change the "banking facility".
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion Who Moved
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian flag for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, was left empty and was ruined.
It is now reopened and has a place of exhibition.
If you are excited about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, its glass hangars, its living and bold allures and its new construction materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion once received the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspended.
The construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture to this day.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the following Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary home with four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent ball-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became famous at the international level in 1973.
His project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the southern Vienna station, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - not walls to expand art works, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used for so long, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly depleted.
The architect Adolf Krischanitz has now transformed the Pavilion, he now bears the name "Maison of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday night, the Belvédère Museum opened, where the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance at any point in sight.
The new departure was carried out well by Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new guide in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvédère.
Husslein-Arco, a historian of art in a considerable career, among other things, in his youth of artistic sponsorship, followed by Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founder of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, led particularly well the transformation of political men and the protection of monuments, she obtained public funds and private sponsorship and established them.
Except for contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a coffee and a library are there, and an office must be built there.
Close surveillance, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and extended with sensitivity the section of Joseph Olbracht and had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen the exhibitions "practically every weekend".
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which was lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and his change of use.
In the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "a vortex in energy", says Krischanitz.
The profile of the glass façades windows was changed, the insulated glass insulated glass fibers was placed and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and the metal-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two subsoils made the place for the new operation, a light panel between the house and the road ensures the lighting, a bridge leading to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but always the light Pavilon Schwanzer.
The outer doors of origin are left, the house is painted in a tent of protection against the red-brown red.
And the cinema room is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all of this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and little expensive should be found, and that also enjoy the office of monumental protection," Krischanitz said and drew attention to a raw soil in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with Pavilion, "who came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "get up the right conscience".
But in this case, the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because it is a chance of urban construction: around the Garden of Switzerland the "Central Station neighborhood" is just standing up all the newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another chance may happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the strengthening of another construction Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art centre, and as he says, it already negotiates with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn's planning a new winter crisis in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
That cost millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million additional this year in this regard.
The daily "Pild"-Zeitung reported on the preamble by calling for an internal crisis plan for the group, that investments of around EUR 300 million would be planned by 2015.
This should also allow for better availability of vehicles and rail networks in the event of extreme emergencies.
The number of internal and external employees for the decommissioning of railway installations should, among other things, double to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the snow and ice from the start of the service phase and 90% of the road equipment needed for the service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the Chief of Station Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the summit of train accidents that took place this winter.
Last winter the railway company has had enormous problems transporting users, because it lacks reservations in the case of difficult weather conditions.
This has been the case with many new regional trains waiting for years to be authorized by the Department of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been doing what for years, since it has to check the ICE trains' performances much more often at the workshop, after a break of the tests took place on an ICE in the central train station in Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the United States.
After the case of Chief Joseph Ackermann, there is again in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if Deutsche Bank's problems were not already enough, the past of this sector's giant hits the US: Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (EUR 106 million) to settle a dispute due to the failure of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The financial market regulator NCUA brings a series of accusations to the large banks, which would have encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents have lost considerable value during the financial crisis and have led the banks to the bottom.
"We are satisfied that we could have found a solution to this issue without the parties starting a trial," said an interlocutor from Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank did not admit any errors in comparison.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which committed itself to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in cases of bankruptcy in order to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair the damage caused by several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took out other large banks and in summer he was assigned to the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents, it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble exploded in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers crashed.
Even though the events have already been dating for a few years, it is now blowing a storm wind on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have resorted to numerous remedies for repair or for sanctioning deficiencies.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
It refers to 18 major international banks, to the two financials of the U.S. estate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to benefit in nature in the case of mortgages of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to apply to FHFA for several operations of a total amount of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities request that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without specifying a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffet increases by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the financier, invests colossal sums in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares for a value of more than ten billion dollars.
Until then, American major investor Warren Buffett explained that he would never stop investing in IT computer companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only makes bad predictions appear.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
He had already come to understand much earlier that IBM is mainly offering services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered to be an attack on the world of finance.
Therefore, the IT IBM activity is granted the right to call now "Mr IBM".
Because Buffett has today revealed to the CNBC economic issue that he has purchased since March IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway thus became a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM has never been aware of this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, who, even during the economic crisis, had provided reasonable benefits.
"You've done a great job," said Buffett strategically.
IBM has for some time put on IT profit services as "exploitation of accounting centres.
The computer pioneer, who is over 100 years old, offers both Software and consultation as well as very efficient business computers.
Buffett had so far prevented technology companies.
He says that he invests only in companies that he understands business.
But on the contrary, Buffett is attacking the railway frenzy, manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway has close to 80 subsidiaries as well as parts of a whole series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Rut munichois.
This 81-year-old octogenary had taken over in the 1960s" the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company and had raised it in the rank of one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of winning money was worth the nickname "Oracle d'Omaha".
Following the announcement of Buffett's investment IBM shares increased by one percent to the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, has a stock exchange value of over $220 billion and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, he says he doesn't want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell", the Turkish media suspected the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "blood ideology", which would be reborn now.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
Because for many Turks, the spectrum that was thought to have died long ago reappeared: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this extremist right-wing context.
Although there is a xenophobia in Germany, there has never been a question.
However, the extremist right-wing network that has been detected reveals the proportions the dimension of which is far from predictable.
"It is a return to bloodthirsty ideology," "It was the title of the online show on the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the authors would have been a V-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme-right bubble.
It was reasonable that the Turkish community in Germany responded: it called this weekend a silent commemoration to victims of racial violence in front of the door of Brandenburg.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community of Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had considered a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It is with gay colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of a giffel: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" such is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Thus, the German parución of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of uniform conditions.
"it starts with a boy," Tel is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
He stressed that people would have been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany by their work.
The police action was seen in a very critical way on German-Turkish forums, and the police had followed up on the success of their research.
Why it has not already come to the German authorities' attention to doing research in certain suspicious areas of extreme right, the authors are amazed.
More than one shows himself ready for at least radical or rhetorical means: "If the case continues to be broken, there will be nothing left to migrants but self-defence and arms."
"it will be the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," says "Selen".
What this means is whether domestic peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks by Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have been well explained.
The photo of the ruins after Solingen's fire is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has made it clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, what the mistrust and the distance from acts of violence could lead to.
The attacks, however, made us feel more at ease in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
At other times it is the failure of the German policy after the attacks of which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After Solingen's fire he sent a condolences telegram to the head of the Turkish state, representing the funerals in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media shows once again how deeply the mistrust of many Germano-turcs has been towards the "local rule of law since that time.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate extreme-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Scandal Bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost failed in the financial crisis and in the meantime, from one crisis to the other.
He's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was known in July that in 2013 he would occupy such a spectacular position: President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed, welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its strength recently obtained and made wonderful comments on future colleagues.
"The UBS has succeeded in the Tour round."
"I am pleased with the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, from September it was clear that everything would change.
A retailer of UBS securities in London had turned all the Bank's security systems around EUR 1.7 billion.
The chief of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the Board of Directors of the UBS is considered to be suffering - and everyone asks: When does Axel Weber finally come back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised by the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the administration presidency already in May - not in 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economy and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adjustment.
On the one hand, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has for a long time earned the title of "the biggest scandal bank in Europe".
Indeed, the UBS is on the one side enormous - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has suffered for years from one scandal to the other.
Nothing, it seems, saves her so proud Swiss bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also Russian, had combined it with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become a very large bank in the area of banking investment.
So the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from a simple clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made a impression.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later a bank professor for years in Zurich relates: "I have always taken the UBS as a good bank model in front of my students."
"In the current perspective, we are asked: how could I have simply deceived myself at this point?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was not going round to the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising way, which was still considered an intellectual high and a genius banker.
A few months later, we were present for what reasons he had left.
The bank division had flagged with sub-prime documents and had to cross billions.
To achieve this, the UBS announced an increase in capital of 13 billion francs and made a cross over it.
For this, it actually found investors, but who, shortly before, would have broken the lights: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which had gone silent, to the point that one has never even learned his name.
This was only the first time, however.
In April 2008, this became an empire.
The bank was to announce back billions of losses, the president of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second Board of Directors the best paid in Switzerland, will withdraw.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: In view of its investment errors, UBS was in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and must be saved by the State.
The National Bank has purchased the UBS of tens of thousands of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for convertible bonds into shares for which it could become the bank's co-owner.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic this can be for a small country, to shelter from such large banks.
Finally, the total of the 2007 UBS budget was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," said bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, it was followed by the second one.
A few months ago, UBS had been capitalizing on a tax dispute with the United States and was reported ready to publish the data from the simple client, who might have cheated on the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it has accepted a $780 million payment - in return for unjustified benefits from these operations with a higher fine.
Thus, UBS published more or less that it had helped tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the Chief of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the customer money exodus.
The bank thus lost its credibility in the two main business sectors in a few months: banking investment due to poor speculation and asset management due to tax fraud.
And, as there was a little calm return, and as we thought, the UBS was going to get out of it, it followed this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single flamed merchant EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank realized that something was going on.
And it's published: with the management of the risk in the investment bank, it still doesn't seem to work.
"In the case of Adolfi, it has been found that the risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
Thus, the financial director of a large German bank is sure of this: "The problem with the UBS is that it does not control the risks in hand."
However, this was exactly the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had for a long time taken up their role, that of being the guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too high a risk, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks became the symbol of unbreakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still going to pair with the strong cliché of the private Swiss bank - it is only a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its seat at the Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to the Zurich Lake, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery like Tiffany's, they are found here among Swiss traditional shops as well as those of the Sprüngli confession.
Since the centuries of Swiss bankers have lived here: from the national bank through the palace of the Swiss Credit to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, facing thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has a day or other market gap - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, the UBS and the Swiss Credit, as the head of a Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with the two big banks as well.
The UBS would become too large, it is found - especially in the banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also spread.
The Swiss would no longer have anything to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxons' masters."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon Investment Bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the great Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"On Wednesday, the small country's government coalition to seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in their nation's history," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The Crash of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, political men have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks jointly concluded a huge group.
A bank has been created, which was already too large for small Switzerland - and has continuously recorded an increase.
What has helped is that the two pre-occupied banks of the UBS have completed: a rich, but lathargy bank with as strong asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but of course already more strongly internationalized.
All of a sudden, international investment banks have had favourable access to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the UBS Ascension: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," said bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the very modest intellectual, which is very well understood in models and statistics, and Opel, the intuitive, who broke a path to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Opel would be proud until the end of Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger said.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the exuberance has arrived before the fall.
UBS personnel clearly remember the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group always spoke the same word of order: detractor Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" classifications, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all the UBS wanted to climb up.
Some steps have already been successful.
In the case of currency and securities transactions, it played a very important role.
However, business advisors, who were responsible for this, highlighted a weakness: in international interest operations, in the fixed income jargon, there would be a huge difference in the largest banks.
UBS would have gaps in US mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS had launched an adventure that almost cost him his life.
Associated with growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the US sub-prime investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and passed the value documents based on US mortgage loans - but which also kept risks.
Even when other banks were looking for a long time to go down.
"It is still in the summer of 2007, while the US real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," said Geiger, the bank expert.
The more the euphoria is the bigger the fall is the brutal one.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts was harder than we thought.
Posts at UBS have become ejectible and are up to now banks.
The one who runs the big bank has a task almost impossible.
It must find a strategy for a bank for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration in property management, return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn't want to go too far.
However, the investment bank must become strong, so far as this is clear.
Next Thursday the bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italians were only supposed to be transitional when the bank separated with surprise from its GRübel predecessor.
In the meantime, it was imposed: it has to carry out the business of the UBS on a sustainable basis, the Bank of Zurich reported on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the middle of the 1990s.
He cancels 3500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to earn money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked.
He publicly said so far only that he was going to look for an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the American Stock Exchange
The threat of a recession in Europe at the end of the week discouraged US investors.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained unaffected.
The southern industrial production on the continent has exacerbated the hopes of stabilization of the debt crisis in its germ.
General relief on government change in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro has fallen compared to the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I had only half full last week, not half old - but now the problems are facing again in advance, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, the financial values were on the sales sheets.
The default values of the Dow-Jones-Index were approximately 0.6% to 12.078 points at the end of the markets.
During the trade, the market barometer fluctuated between 12027 and 12170 points.
The S & P 500 index is more firmly fixed at 1251 points, a deficit of 1%
Nasdaq, the index of the technology exchange lost 0.8%, and ended with 2657 points in the market.
In Frankfurt, Dax ended with a decrease of 1.2% to 5985 points.
The industry in the 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced its production and adjusted at the end of the recovery.
As announced by the Eurostat Statistics Office, companies produced in September, 2% less than the previous month.
American investors were skeptical: "We are not an island, on the other hand," said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe will soon not be able to recover from recession, and there are other signs of weakness coming from banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has just confirmed this caution: "It is not clear if Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
As a result, it was too early to invest in obligations arising from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett has cast an old principle of several decades into the wind and enters the American technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars to IBM has supported the course of the traditional group's actions, and has enabled him to note almost 1 per cent, against the trend of commercial management.
The paper has almost been replaced at $187.35.
Buffett claims to have paid an average of $170 per piece, and now holds 5.5 per cent.
The price of its investment company Berkshire Hathaway has lost 1.3%.
Bank of America's shares amounted to 2.6%, much higher than the market.
The house invested almost all the rest of its shares in the "China Construction Bank" (China Construction Bank) and removed $6.6 billion.
The institution intends to maintain the company's net profit, including its capital ratio, and therefore meet the most difficult regulatory requirements.
Airman Boeing has increased his business and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The shares won 1.5% after the company collected the largest order of its history.

Smart corneas spread in cities
In many places, frogs are considered "the problem of birds" but experts say that these very intelligent animals are no longer allowed to hunt cities for a long time.
Some people like them, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Cornells have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities residents' complaints are multiplied because of the salinity and noise of animals.
An antidote to the "op problem of birds" is not yet in view.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on the corneas, the experts said it was no longer possible to hunt the strawberries of the cities.
The experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in the cities
The protectionists of nature were also based on the problems of cities also on the exodus of specially protected strawberries: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying the traditional living spaces.
The hunting, processing and slaughter of typical cove trees made life difficult for birds.
The corneas are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 coves in the Westfälische Soest, in the north-west including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had received negative publicity due to the massacre of corneas in this region.
Critics found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal gourmets.
"The normal eviction, the eviction, is nothing," noted the planner of the city and the landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of the nests with water under pressure or the fall of trees, often results in adverse consequences, says environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr in Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals go away, the great colonies split and scattered in other places."
In exceptional cases, such as in hospitals, nursing homes or schools, the event is only imaginable.
"We are forced to live with them, we can no longer eliminate them."
The problem is not solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Major Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of animal escape to an aversive condition and extensive offers to enable them to be re-installed elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens was looking at "information panels at the cross section" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better support a button on the face with a dose of confidence in ourselves."
Jürgens co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein Corbels Ascheberger-Education-Roading, road panels informing about the life of these very intelligent brakes.
This project has been adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "There was a great deal of communication, these birds have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: the brakes do not only use working instruments to achieve a rule, but they themselves make their tools as working instruments.
Ecologists at Cambridge University recently tested four brakes, to what extent the intelligence of the birds reaches.
In an experience, the birds quickly learned that they had to make an excavate with stones to reach a larvae.
Without much training, they firmly recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to break the platform.
In a second test, the wise corneas were then to solve a more tricky problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small lid with a larvae.
Birds could not reach their button with their beak.
However, researchers had put iron wire pieces at their disposal.
All four animals formed a crochet with the help of which they fished the small shark’s sail.
Three of the four brakes were successful even from the start.
Cristiano Ronaldo takes Portugal to the European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosniaks and the Turks for a time remained unsuccessful.
Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the latest tickets in the 2012 European Championships in Poland and suddenly Ukraine was eliminated.
Conducted by the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th), Portugal has competed against Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made its fifth participation in the European Championship perfect after 0:0 of the match.
The Czechs achieved the elimination-reversibility match by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first manch (2:0) had already been an obvious thing.
There was no more burning in the zero 0:0 match between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) release against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) marked the other arrows for Portugal.
The former player of the Bundesliga Wolfsburg, Zvězdan Misimovic, with an 11-metre penalty at hand (41th) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) made twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red map (54e).
Bosnia had already failed at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured departure.
Ronaldo sent a 30-metre free shot ahead in the mailbox.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her remote shooting qualities and pulled at a distance of 25 meters to do 2:0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half of the day did nothing, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of Manchester City's English championship, initiated a head ball headed down the crossbar, the balloon did not break the target line (33e).
Jiracek has set a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally, Ergolding's Arbitrant Wolfgang Stark at the center of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during Bosnia's penalization, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow map in Portugal (36e).
On the other hand, Stark granted an 11-metre penalty to the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic probably differed.
But, after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion has succeeded four times and everything has become clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts during the 81th minute.
Thus, the 1976 European Championship will go to EM for a fifth time.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also had the chance and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
The goalkeeper Petr Cech has prevented a last minute's goal from reflecting on the potential of Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Steven Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic marked the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to the Czech arrow.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the rescue of the world-class guard of the Czechs, once again, the attacker of the FC Seoul had been replaced (50e).
The short-term objective before the end has finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football miracle during this time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his seat on the third EM bank in 2002, Croatia was able to enjoy its fourth round at the end of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators at the Maximir stage, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream.
Selcuk Inan scored at the seventh minute with a long shot with only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim was not even able to bury the balloon in the goal.
After the time of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic du VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic de Dortmund at 62 e-minute, the legionaries of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Entrach Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in EM
In Dublin, the Irish have celebrated their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of Coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken charge of a success of 4:0 the first step for a preliminary decision, 32 minutes.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57e) was equal for visitors.
Ireland moved to higher speed from the beginning, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that Estonia's defence has been able to prevent a possible target of the -first switch.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unfavourable defense of the goal guard Pavel London, Ward was hand-held and will close the balloon on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and employ employees as a result," PDG Bill McDermott announced to his clients on an equitable basis in Beijing.
The staff member will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader of business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the 176,000 global SAP customers are located in this country in full expansion.
The growth plans in China are also an important element of the Dax Group's 2015 Strategy.
SAP plans to increase business figures by 2015 to EUR 20 billion.
Last year, Walldorf recorded an income of nearly EUR 12.5 billion.
Currently, the management of the software supplier's business, who employs 55,000 people, has never worked well.
SAP has been active in China for more than 20 years.
"Now, we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
The slaughter of personal mass
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. titled "The Beauty and the Sorow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and Grief: an intimate story of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that closes your heart.
A tips to start: carefully discard this page and make it your brand-page.
In this novel by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a score during these moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the storms of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote here a book outside the community that he described, accurately, as "an anti-history book."
It contains some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is hardly any ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it might look like" is found in the "senses, impressions, experiences and humours."
"Beauty and Grief" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from young schoolchildren and botanists to climbers, passing through doctors, ambulances and sellers.
Some of us will become heroes.
Other prisoners of war. Some will lose members, become fools or lose their lives.
Their lives come here like the candles of a church: while some grow up, new ones are born.
The book of Peter Englund separates from the books of traditional history.
It is a disgrace to the idea that World War I is only a summary of the terrible war on the Western front.
"Beauty and Grief" describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, the Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under the rocks; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the teddy bears are an intrusive problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people such as a natural disaster, such as a Hurricane Katrina that can heal her.
When the cannon blows stay away, and if you're a mother in the house, stay or run away?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, not even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been exacerbated by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English food in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high sea fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memories, letters and other documents that have already been published.
The versions of their lives can be frightening or exciting, but they are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most people approach privacy and the ability to get out of it.
Speaking of the history of a German school, Peter Englund wrote: "Erassat, everywhere essast."
"Replaced coffee, false aluminum, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
He describes the "meat made of rice crushed in the fat of sheep (and finished with a false bone of wood); tobacco made with dried roots and dry skin of potatoes; seeds of wood shoe."
He claims that "837 authorized substitutes are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories address honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own appeal to the wild and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, that is what men were meant to do, rather than sit in a comfortable faucet, a cigarette and a whisky hand, reading a newspaper or a best-selling, and rather than claiming that such a painting is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbaric behind your tight and tight shirt.
On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that he is at risk of death, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When we are denied sacrifice, we hope to have a public," he wrote.
Unfortunately, it is rather comparable to "a man convicted in secret."
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He seized the arrival of what he called "a new species within the cattle of the beginning of the century: the murder of a well-artificed and ideologically convinced mass, in well-cut clothes, who executes his bakery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are both basic and heroic behaviors.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who have tried to catch a venerable disease in prostitutes at any cost in order to avoid service to the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of the most indebted to gonorrhoea, that soldiers buy and "stand on the genital organs in the hope of ending the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into a blindness to life."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasps the way in which the war has "beyond the most uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, a revolution for religion."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders make them a war.
The best works dealing with World War I are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "In the West nothing again", by Erich Maria Note, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is a little conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most exciting thing I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he had come up from his book, grab hold of your hands on this page where the list of people and burned with a candle.
After a first false step, a minutely planned operation
Hundreds of police officers have been involved, some with anti-fungal helmets.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zucotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation was kept secret from all outside of some senior officers, as well as from the beginning of the exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges of the Police Department.
There could be no repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, which have gone against the department's regulation and caused a storm of public solidarity for demonstrators.
The operation to clean the Zucotti Park of its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The policemen were prepared to observe occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall's island for the operation of Zucotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures that quickly move a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan area.
The last training session took place on Monday night, by Manhattan of the East River.
The orders given to move in the park were reached "at the last minute", said a habit, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few policemen I know who were called didn't know that they would return to Zucotti Park," said the person under anonymity.
"The only ones to know that they would be at the top of the hierarchy of the Department of Police."
The city's got a lesson, where the secret of the operation comes from.
On 14 October, policemen wanted to clean up the park, but they had been denied by hundreds of informed protesters of the plans.
The Tuesday operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the district - dozens of officers who were used to particularly criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that a lot of people were going and coming to the park during the day, like migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good time.
"It should have been done when the park had at least one person" he said.
Vehicles of emergency services equipped with spot and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan bridge, before intervention.
The recorded lights and messages of the speakers were like terrorizing demonstrators.
While Community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their clear blue wind blowers, many demonstrators simply gathered their affairs and went away.
No attempt was made before 1:45 p.m. and the police said, which allowed time for the occupants to gather their affairs.
Other police teams were reviewed on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists present within the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesperson of the Chief of Police Department, stated that this measure had been taken only by security.
According to many journalists, however, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention within the park, strictly held by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the television cameras on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police were moving west across the manifests' business slots, including luggage, plastic gauze and bags of sheets filled with clothing, the teams of the department of sanitation followed, cleaning everything the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged away. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the park center.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the camp centre have grown together.
Finally, two people were chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the chains.
No arrests took place in the park before 3 p.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to the Police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, almost 142 people were arrested in the park.
most for "adversity in the public order and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most qualified officer to be found in the places.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not lead the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of policemen were suffering along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricades were placed on Cortland Street, a piece of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
The police have seen the extension of the perimeter well beyond the Zucotti Park.
Several officers, most of whom were equipped with shields, would have even been seen pushing people away.
About 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most lively events of the night took place south of the park.
About 5 a.m., in the south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped over the head of a police car. Others were seen raising the tires of a police truck.
At some point, a convulsive end came up flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protesters were hospitalized.
The School Aid Union continues the city for Licensing
The union, which represents hundreds of school aids that have lost their jobs last month, intends to try a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools receiving disadvantaged schools.
The prosecutions are probably the last weapon of the union, the Council of the 37th District, to try to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and twelve school grants, parents' coordinators and other employees, who were among the less well-paid in the city, lost their jobs last October 7th. The union leaders compared these concessions to a political revenge so that they did not allow the city to access a health fund led by the working groups, which would have closed the budget gap in the last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this charge.
At a hearing of the Municipal Council last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that the allowances were part of the budget closed in June.
One member of the Council replied, stating that the school grants were not specified in the budget.
The officers of the 37th District Council stated that they would make a complaint, warning the Department of Education that it would continue; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecutions to the Supreme Court of State of Manhattan.
Dennis Mr. Walcott and the department of the "Education of the City" will be the defensive part. The complainants will be represented by eight licensed workers, all of black or Latin American origin, such as most of the school aid that has lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson of the city's legal department, said that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a statement of complaints received by the New York Times, the trade union would place on the number of allowances in schools in the city's most disadvantaged districts to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular under-financing.
While there are no licenses on Staten Island, and a few in the Upper East Side or TribeCa facilities, 17 school grants lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx Districts.
Noting the loss of five school grants on eight employees at the 36 Harlem public school, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecutions state that "This is not a neighborhood of easy parents who can raise funds to fill the budget deficit."
The public school budget 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year, and funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each enrollment of disadvantaged students.
The trade union also claims that the lycée directors could have been misled by certain terms in a memorandum authorising the licensing of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "transgression" to describe the action, even though "transgression" more generally describes the action to move a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaint, "six-six parents coordinators have been licensed", and "not just because of overcrowding".
Mission completed: Congress finds an agreement on the issue of Libya
It would seem that the Republicans and Democrats finally found an agreement in the Capitol on the question of the rise in Libya.
The long-term dictator Muammar Kadhafi as well as the American involvement will have to be successful.
The Senate's Foreign Relations Committee will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democratic - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republic - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), praising the Libyan people for their rebellion and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honor the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, the two parties' legislators, along with the White House, came into conflict on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving the military role of the United States in NATO's mission to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day of the draft bill failure, the House of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of US operations in Libya.
The American mission is therefore left in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress is sufficiently opposed to criticise the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The indecisiveness of Congress has been exceeded by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Kadhafi was killed last October.
NATO's mission was officially completed on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "happily welcomes the Libyan people for their courage and extraordinary determination for freedom" and "happily welcomes the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure take all the support of the Senate's Foreign Affairs Commission or divide the legislators as in June?
The Senator and Chairman of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesperson said on Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House must vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republicans of Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a flooring vote in the House or the Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to approve their amendments, but this is not without trying.
The Goodlatte amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been submitted to Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are repeated - the same bill proposed at both the House and the Senate - and others are slightly different from a previous one.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another item that would "control federal expenditures".
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - especially the new Republicans who want to lose their CV - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act approved last August called for the vote of the House and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates for which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democratic - New York) wishes to extend the limits of two mandates for the presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democratic - Illinois) proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is permanently proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the profanation of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the repeal of federal laws if the two thirds of States oppose them.
As well as those who have been members of the House to offer amendments, they are not as fast as they were in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 at 110th.
The chain slowed down at the beginning of the 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacre but not beat" says Gabrielle Giffords during his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man pulled him over to Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democratic - Arizona) appeared on Monday night in a television show, he sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said he wanted to get back rather than return to Congress first.
On his appearance on the TV "20/20" on the ABC channel, next to Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The release approached her difficult return following the bullet that fractured her skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing her head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
During his first television interview since the shooting in January, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and qualified his recovery as "hard".
After Diane Sawyer asked how she felt, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords replied "very well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and his husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special edition of an hour of "20/20", broadcast the watch of the release of the new book of the couple entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special issue has retraced the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting of January 8.
In the videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he was seen on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a wide scar on the front.
She can only use one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords was sitting in a wheelchair while doctors taught him to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word, "what."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords heard another word ("Toast") to ask for a change of the menu of her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: are we seeing the Representative singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wana Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours with doctors every day, said not to remember the gun.
According to her husband, he was reading an article on the 12 March shooting when she stopped and asked for information on the first time about the six people killed during the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, was detained in a prison in Missouri and was actively treated pending trial.
"There's been a lot of deaths," said Gabrielle Giffords in Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
At her return, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I've been beaten."
"Then I'd say, " Gabby, you weren't beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're going to get out, get back and get back stronger than ever.
More mercy than respect for the troops
The event: a gala at Wall Street to collect millions of dollars for vets without homes in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a dance on impotentness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and sailors around him.
The crowd in costume-crawl stood up to its feet to welcome it.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fund collection.
A military high-level in the gala, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, United States Army Chief of Staff, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were presented as a kind of Orpheline," wrote the military-grade in an electronic mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But that was not respect, just mercy.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praises are offered to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, they say a few soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if he was sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not all victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to get involved in the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to appear unrecognizable or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of Vietnam's coming troops has been much worse.
Thus, most of the conversations on mercy take place in all confidence among the veterans.
After his two sons returned from the battle with the Marines, the retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to distant conflicts.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said he felt that some people who were making him go through the interview asked in a subtle way if he would be able to cope with the stress of a job demanding in Washington immediately after his return to the fight.
"When you approach the subject of service, you are confronted with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to war.
The victories are rarely welcomed by a country that is as familiar with the army as it is with the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for the Second World War " states Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of political men and people are largely focused on the depth of the sufferings of a military.
The troops are recognized for the number of service periods, the number of lost friends or the extent of the injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to fight the violent
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged rape inaction.
Where appropriate, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next.
The 1st class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant on the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She returned to her home at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a package of beer.
He asked if he could join her in his room to drink a glass.
"C" was an alarm signal," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane's worried about it.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"It's Texas," she says.
"I should've followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her in the back, threw her down and raped, claiming her.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and others, will look forward to the judicial decision during a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and decide whether a trial against former secretary to the Robert Gates defense and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not stopping the generalization of the violence in the army, thus countering the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial involved 17 complainants. This number rose to 28 the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claimed that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide appropriate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says to take it to the galloned soldiers, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the individuals in position to "extend the culture of reprisals?"
The lawyer also states that since February, it has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom may be part of future judicial proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of gathering all the complainants in this case - thus putting all their eggs in the same basket - it will try several trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defence team, led by American lawyer Neil MacBride, for the Department of Defence, filed a motion to reject the case.
The legal documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused by the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, named Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active staff.
" The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants " indicate the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to fight, this distinction is recorded only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women's troops play an increasingly important role, including in contact with local women.
As a result, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in a combat situation.
It's time for the army to modernise Susan Burke's declaration.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are under way in addition to hers.
At Yale's Law School, the Veterans' Legal Service Centre prepares a case against the four main military academys to encourage a misogynous environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation of Vietnam Veterans of America prepares a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnostics of " personality disorders " attributed to victims of rape in order to give them permission - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as the Women's Action Network Service Year, a group for human rights.
His group attempted a trial in December to the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims of benefits for those claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the sexual assault intervention and prevention centre (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the Department of Defence.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred this year.
The report in March also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the army were brought to trial - half of the percentage of the civilian judicial system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she reported to the military police about rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to report 11 times in detail her rape to various policemen, doctors and commanders.
She went up a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge, in a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relationship with her little friend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six people testified as moral witnesses for the author of the crime, who ended up being executed.
"I remember the day the verdict was made," said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contracts, and I was called after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commander, "It wasn't his trial, it was mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosed with a personality disorder, making her unserviceable.
In January 2010, it was transferred under less than honorable terms, preventing it from receiving any benefit.
Whether Lyman and other complainants will move forward or not, it is a long story, says John Turley, a professor of law at the Faculty of Law at the University of Washington.
However, he noted, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticised since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized Doc Feres.
The army is behind decades ago because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence imposed by responsibility.
"The odds are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things only change when the good are willing to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the complainant's lawyer, will gather his hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform," she says.
Where until we died, either of the two options.
The walls have eyes: the researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple man who was part of his online anti-immigration opinions.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been taken from a murder follicle in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time preceding the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme-right groups on social networks sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy... connect to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a report recently published by the DEMOS reflection group on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook boasts so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool of the site to find the people they are looking for with scientific accuracy - the way they have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that one and a half million members are fans of the extreme right groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to answer a survey. The questions raised were their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people via Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 participants from 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way to do research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising: online participants in right-wing groups are, rather, men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screen."
The study of DEMOS is just an example of how Facebook became the new inconvenient tool among scientists.
Groups of reflections, medical researchers and polytologists use the site to study all topics that touch health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I love", wall publications and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the "supernova data" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research work on the site's name by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you could not approach in the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go to the party, but they'd never let you in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all of this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could offer a way to identify and deal with health and social problems.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their state of marriage had far more chances of being alcoholic than discreet students in this regard.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status would be too frequent to talk about alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Research Institute for Children in Seattle, says Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not be otherwise recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesss information from its users.
The website's data team has studied statistics on the loving situation and the day of Saint Valentin, the rate of participation in the 2010 mid-term elections and a national happiness index (with only available information - the digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation that they haven't even heard about?
While researchers have well defined instructions on how to collect information other than via the Internet, there is something else online.
"I don't think a lot of users have already thought that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the true degree of a profile or on the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That's why, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a block-note and a style remain the best tools you can use.
"Nothing will replace the real world and contact with people," he said.
"Social studies are intended to address the social aspect - and social, it is not before a computer."
"Froid et inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik's first appearance
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organised the two attacks that killed 77 in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first appearance to the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Temples," he explained in front of a hearing room full of 500 people.
"As for the jurisdiction of the court, I reject it, because you have your mandate of organizations supporting a hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't complain guilty."
Judge Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to let him use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, to speak to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the Police to keep Breivik in custody for twelve weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that the authorities would monitor almost all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Thirty parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some have come in the hope of looking Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that it would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya at the Norwegian TV channel NRK.
"I wasn't at ease, but I personally made some progress after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes when he came in and out of court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge has determined that he was not mad. He also stated that there is no evidence that he has acted with complicity.
The attacks of July 22 appear to be the work of an extremist rather than of a whole group of radicals, which may be comforting to some.
But this does not reduce the sorrow or confusion felt by the nation as a whole.
"I'd prefer it to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a victim's parent.
"That would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs lost interview at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs died last October, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical engineering and inventor of modern computer technology.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recent interview with Steve Jobs, which will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how much this creative spirit included the processes and workflows of the products.
He was certainly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself as a hippie but was also very methic and organized, as well as an improvement in organizational charts - a man who believed that many business leaders would suffer from a "maladie that they thought a brilliant idea made 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exception product."
In 1995, Bob Kringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series delayed the computer's birth, and he stayed for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aimed at popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of the maintenance with Kringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in transport.
It's only after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video is found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly mounted, is based on a 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released to the film on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems here to be surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technological philosophies and his commercial strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs rises, where he seems unable to understand the questions of Crengely, giving him tails to speed it up and move it to issues or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, there is a strangely prominent aspect of Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers to be good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computer science.
It's a thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something dirty and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dream at the watch of greatness.
It has a vision of how things can and must be.
He then explains how they are implemented.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a company:
"For all these years, I have always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are always the same: 'oh, just because you have to do them."'
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details of his efforts to simplify the accounts at Apple.
Perplexes the way the costs were recorded - often started with a "standard cost" assessed for nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated factory that ensured the precise calculation of the commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to hack telephone networks and phone for free in long distance.
The device has made many writings in advance, but Steve Jobs' euphory here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, then calling and connecting from one AT&T network to another while turning as many satellites as possible.
"We would wrap up the bubble of different things a half dozen times and you would scream in the public phone and that would happen a minute later on to the public phone next," explains Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We don't know a big thing both of us, but we have come up with a small thing that can control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have a day without it.
Steve Jobs continues to tell a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are gathered in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two colleagues go away in vain laughing just before the Pope himself wakes up.
On his love with technology (and departure of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, at the chase to the remote parts to manufacture a frequency, he is looking for Bill Hewlett's number in the annuary and passes over a thread.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This has had a remarkable influence on me. C" was the only company I saw at that age and it formed my definition of a company and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs then became one of HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a small cathode tube, and I fell in love with him.
Adolescent I was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a head start.
At the beginning of his career, while he is installed to sell some printed circuit cards, a customer asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties he encountered to develop a computer mouse:
"I remember big disputes... I was raised on it, claiming that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and I went to see a designer."
Forty-nine days later, we had a smile that we could make for $15, which would be incredibly reliable.
In the case of large companies:
Even before he made Apple come back, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way in which many industrial leaders were going to cheat and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, make a better copy or a better printer, and then?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can evolve, so [these are the types of people] who end up leading companies and the specialized personnel in the product are being "dissociated from decision-making.
The product engineering that has led to this monopoly position is completely possible by people who cannot imagine to design a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have done ten times its current size. Xerox would have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
They've caused the defeat of the victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a great deal about its subtleties.
There are commitments to do... certain things you can't do, the electrons can, the glass, the robots, the factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) together with each other.
Finally, the decisions are made by personal taste. It is to try to expose you to the best products that men have created, and to try to bring these things into the product that you create.
Picasso once said good artists copy and great artists want.
We're always ashamed to steal great ideas.
This is in part what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply had the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with opponents of the right to health while the court meets
On the day that the Supreme Court met at home to discuss the issue of political dispute, namely whether the opposition to President Obama's health law would be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were observed during a dinner sponsored by the law firm that would defend the case before the high court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases concerned was an intentional trial by 26 States contesting the reform of the ambitious health care voted by Congress last year, a law that was a focal point for conservative militants at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a 5h30 monumental argument is expected next March, and the result will probably be a way of promoting the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision is delivered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the rejection of the law will probably be Paul Clement, who served as the United States' general solicitor during George W. Bush's administration.
Clement's legal cabinet, PLLC Bancroft, was part of the two dozen cabinets that helped to accompany the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-term group dedicated to defending the conservative legal principles.
Another cabinet that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, who presented a huge financial issue as a result of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
There was, among other things, Mitch McConnell, a republican top of the Senate and an opponent declared by the health law.
The guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing going against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct governing the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would undoubtedly argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend a collection of funds from law-related organizations and others that the judge cannot be an interpreter, an honorary guest, or a member of the program of such an event".
However, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the business lawyers' offices, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, is sufficient to alert the activists of government ethics.
"This violation of ethics and great indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court complies with the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and slept and a collection of gala funds with lawyers who have court cases."
Their presence and participation in the collection of funds of this event demonstrates any claim of impartiality, and it is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for critics claiming that they are too easy to mix court cases with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high profile conservative.
Furthermore, conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a problem of ethics, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general solicitor for Obama's administration when the first opposition to the law was brought to the level of the Court of First Instance.
His critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she was too invested in the defense of the law to be impartial.
Kagan didn't give any indication that she would.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for online aircraft
The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777, bi-coloured airline, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at over a billion dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order containing 50 of its products.
On the other hand, this is a case where the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record of $18 billion.
All too amazing is who Boeing received this command: the Middle East, a gold mine growing from future aircraft orders.
In the forecast published on Monday, Chicago believes that the air carriers in the Middle East will need a total value of $450 billion over the next 20 years of 2,520 aircraft.
During the weekend, Boeing informed the most expensive commercial aircraft control in his history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-colours.
It is the Emirates based airline in Dubai that passed this Pharaohic command.
Boeing announced in the 2011 Dubai Aeronautics Chamber that the airline is also able to buy 20 additional planes, which would raise the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated on Monday that the company Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, named Dreamliners, a model that boasts important fuel savings and conveniences for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to over a billion dollars.
"It's clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have great value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means to pay these planes, but a rise in the price of the fuel - which is harmful to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or vary their aircraft orders when the oil price increases, Dihora reported.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
The Command of Emirates reinforces Boeing's predominance on the wholesaler aircraft market and helps to halt the attempts to push the Airbus competitor with its A350.
Boeing's victory at the airship is four months after Airbus' announcement to report the beginnings of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus resets its beginnings to increase its push as a result of the demand of its customers to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's shares increased by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
The Mexican President's sister manifestly beaten at the elections in Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers have helped her rival Fausto Vallejo of PRI in the run at the Governor's post.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to access the government of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers have promoted one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the head of the race at the post of Governor of that Western State.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon told the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... they got rid of urns, installed roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI has ruled Mexico for sixty-ten years until the loss of the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have noticed only a little of Calderon, who was head of polls before the day of the elections.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, who currently holds the role of Governor, has suffered a third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidentials for this divided and miserable left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, has detached all links with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine trafficking.
It is the state of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence persisted.
A week before the election, a PAN mayor was murdered while he was campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates refused the campaign locally for fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections have the air, a victory will help the party in its wake.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for the next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to come to aid the euro area
The Asian Development Bank asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area emerge from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the BASD based in Manila, said that the two most rapid economic forces in the world had to "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with a "indifferent eye" and said that Asian financial support to Europe's leaders and resources would help to avoid a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We are all in this crisis together."
"Therefore, anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected up to a certain point, but she's not in the open."
"So if China and India can help, nothing can stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously hit by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan is dangerously high and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has caused the fear that the global economy will not get back to recession, and has prompted the call for major emerging economies to meet to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag claimed that the IMF would provide any Asian assistance, but he also stated that this bilateral assistance - such as purchasing the obligations of the U.S. Financial Savings Fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - would offer greater negotiating power to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce and Indian Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy now suffers from a drop in exports and a delay in foreign capital returns.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to meet and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans while facing their own major economic challenges.
Ashtosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically difficult to accept assistance from Europe to 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least $800 000 live with $2 a day, or less.
"One day, they will discover that the Greeks take their retirement at 50 years of age and leave on vacation in the sun and they will be ill to swallow it," he reported.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the railway sector.
Mr. Nag said that the crisis in the euro area could cause "significant impacts" across Asia.
The forecasts of the BASD of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 are now facing "risks of loss" due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed "to develop relief plans" to protect themselves from economic and significant capital flows.
Certain Pentagon warnings on potential defence reductions
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, put pressure on the Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budgetary compressions would know national security and triggered a financial response from the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields, passing through civilian meetings.
The Pentagon already owes $450 billion for the next decade, but now it is afraid that an additional $600 or more compression will be imminent if Congress does not reach an agreement on expenditures.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry," said Panetta in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting from what is called the sequestration would result in 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"A reduction so important, applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and our construction projects ineffective - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and bring serious damage to other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be so quickly imposed, we should almost certainly send free-wage civilians to achieve the goal."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our soldiers and seriously harm our preparation."
Reductions would possibly affect fighting troops, continue Panetta.
"Although wartime financing of foreign contingent accounts is not directly affected by the sequestration, war efforts would be adversely affected by the serious disturbances in the core budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting staff would be reduced, causing delays in contracts and supervision of contracts supporting the war."
"The salary management staff would be reduced, causing delays in payments to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, requesting details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a kidnapping on the Department of Defence would have triggered a rapid decline in the United States as the uncontested world leader of military power."
"We are extremely opposed to this draconian action," said the senators in a joint communiqué Monday afternoon at the publication of the letter from Panetta.
"This is not a consequence that we can live with, and that is certainly not what we should impose on us."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not happen."
Whether the letter from Panetta and the recent senators' warnings increase the pressure for a budgetary compromise or an appeal to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though it has reached its highest position in the Pentagon, collecting years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that it was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark picture of what might happen - a military with a shell, but not a cloud.
"It's a ship with no sails."
"It's a ballless brigade."
"It's a hunting plane, not enough trained pilots."
"It is a tiger in paper, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that do not have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," said Panetta in his preliminary remarks in the Pentagon.
"It is a depressing, ill-prepared and incapable force to deal with potential opponents."
"In fact, she invites the aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could " generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risks to future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could be cut down, including those already tested and some just at the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the ballistic sub-marine of a new generation, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
To put an end to the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in 10 years, but its participants say it is an essential step towards improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivers.
How to Report Bug
A look at the recent sleeves indicates the extent to which deceit and lying are omnipresent in everyday life.
The Republican candidate for the presidency, Herman Cain, is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators were accused of compensating for allegedly covering reports that a football coach at retirement had sexually assaulted boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone claiming US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and robbed countries.
The member of the New York Congress and the celebrity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, has been passed on to an idiot by quickly issuing statements contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
The former candidate for President John Edwards was accused of violations of the funding of campaigns related to the coverage of an extra-conjugal link.
And then, none of those who have lived the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term of office on his sexual involvement with Monica Levinsky.
The story of cheating at school and university tests is legion.
There have been cases where teachers gave the student test responses in order to take a close look at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the contrary send the message that lie and deceit are acceptable.
How much deception do we meet?
On a given day, the studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
To detect or identify lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I've had you," the detection of fraud is a serious knowledge-based sector of scientific data collected in the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted a deep research on such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the results of research is that the oldest myths on the lie have been demystified.
The liars look in your eyes.
They don't cheat, they don't steal, or they don't bother.
Do not conclude that mentors are difficult to detect and difficult to detect.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, the training of the question and the time of response.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging knowledge of deception, and it is clear that the detection of fraud is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include employment, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good mentors are able to read to others, by putting them at ease, by managing their own emotions and by intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraterrestrials lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "focused on them" while women say more lies "focused on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than non-marriage people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's thinking?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "setting benchmarks".
This helps to provide a reference point to measure subsequent changes.
Watch the position of your subject, the laugh, the voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally removes his feet permanently so as not to launch unfair accusations when you see him remove his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for evidence of misleading and non-verbal behaviors.
Consider these signs as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Traitors can immobilize the body's top when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet towards the door, turn to a exit, change their posture significantly, or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all difficult questions have passed.
Questionnaires often indicate that maintenance is just finished to try to trigger the post-interview response.
So pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson came by using the past, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
The tricky individuals can also use a remote language: "I didn't have sexual relations with this woman... Ms. Levinsky" or repeat a completely difficult question.
The most common oral indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" when answering a difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember things... to my knowledge."
This makes the perceptive answer rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize fraud is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances of avoiding the victim's victims in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be abandoned after the US late approval threat
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - causing the wrath of the trade unions while feeding the environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline said it was ready to redirect the project to put it on the rails.
TransCanada stated on Monday night that it will move the pipeline projected outside the ecologically sensitive zone of the dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still gain its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's official, Alex Parbax, says the company remains confident that it will end up obtaining the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it received new studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala aquifer, from large groundwater sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska in Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after the next year's elections, although officials refuse to involve policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed his support.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He would transport 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to the Texas refineries.
To do so, he would have to cross six States.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have put on the 20 000 estimated jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska's legislators opposed to this plan pressure that a law for forced removal of the Sand Hills region and Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study in the Department of State found that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said that the Department's inspector had ordered a separate survey of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist engaged by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice for its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A family in New York claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle, launched in a crackdown of violence in the hall of their Manhattan building, terrorized their little girl to the point where she was afraid of it.
The kidnapping of the singer "Lady Marmalade" broke out the 18-month-old little Geneva Monk, so that she suffered "changes of personality, sleep disorders" and "the increased fear of foreigners," said her family during the trial of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was November 10th last year while the technician Kevin Monk, his wife's teacher of the children's garden, Rosana, and Genevieve would prepare to leave on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was looking for the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the hall of their building of the Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Geneva in his arms.
Rosana Monk said she was arrested near the door and had put her daughter for a moment.
"Someone came after me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went looking for her," she said.
LaBelle was angry with the pregnant woman.
"She said to me of an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Rosaanna Monk.
"I told him, "what you say or think I don't care."
She became angry and began to use oaths - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and started to spew me out of the water of the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneva had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you have done to my daughter," says the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself on her mother - who always held Geneva in her arms - and had to be held by her environment that led her to a car waiting for them, says Rosaanna Monk.
The little girl would cry so hard that she got to vomit, add her.
Later, the family sent a note requesting LaBelle's apologies, but she didn't get any answers.
The lawyer and LaBelle's representatives did not return our calls for comments.
The complaint claims unspecified damage, but the family lawyer Sam Davis said that he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to make a donation of all the money received to a charity against cancer for children.
"The goal is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a mother's teacher with a child of 18 months."
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment decreased and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, which is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-calling change, which has generated great expectations for economic progress, but given the climate aversity of the beginning of the year, growth is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The lower temperatures of February, in addition to the loss of billions for the agricultural sector, limited the potential of the state's growth economy, caused a contract of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the report from the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there have been damage to 582 million 835 hectares of cultivated crops, of which 78.03 per cent have suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent have suffered partial damage, the main contaminating crops have been vegetables, corn and pears.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment of the State during the first three quarters of the year was seen as an accelerated increase, as from January to March 55 thousand 053 people were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate of 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate of more than 74 thousand unemployed people, an increase compared to the first half of 18 million 969 people.
Less liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to actions carried out by public policy.
"What is observed is an increase in unemployment due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally, it is not easy for them to work for them, invest them and use them in something," he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the State to go to work abroad has been limited to the United States, first because of the difficulties of entry and second because they already have a lot of difficulties to find work, these people stay here and ask for work sources, which makes unemployment rising," he said.
Not serious
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloin is exacerbated by the high level of serious shortages that predominate between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state is working without paying as a worker in any social insurance institution.
Apart from the unemployment and the serious lack of employment, another reason for decommissioning for the state is low wages, the entity has lower salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of the laborers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
IED contraction
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011, the highest reduction in foreign direct investment over the past 10 years has been recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economics from January to June, the State IED reached $630 billion 697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to the $5143 billion 312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion per year, mainly registered by companies in the third sector.
Leave this
In the light of the economic contract scenario, the Government of the State requested in July a 3 billion-weight credit for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of revitalizing the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 billion-weighted, and no benefits of debt were observed in any sector of the State economy until November.
Reactions
For representatives of the boss sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align the effort of all and above all the well-synchronized march of this new government team, hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic Lent
Loredo López stated that events such as the ice-cream of the beginning of the year kept the state's economy and limited its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced by several events, including ice cream, one of the main effects was a slow economy that didn't turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamic that allows to have an acceptable level of e-flow in the processes, products and services and thus, at the end of the year, we close much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine the Appointment
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Mexican Patronal Confederation of Sinaloa, stated that the state is being channelled towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms we have noted that we have been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important to detach all the potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources," he said.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a future vision that would better channel the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in various areas, but there is some progress in economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He reported that the current administration had shown progress in the way of governance of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still much to do," he said.
Condemned for 8 kilos of marijuana
A person living in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of imprisonment for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The General Park of the Republic reported that the convicted minor is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in its variant of possession of marijuana for sale.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on the Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of the number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker ran in a pick-up type truck, white, in which he carried a bag of black in the vehicle's luggage and on the co-pilot's seat a small bag at the back where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements were made available to the Second District Justice and the convicted person is still at the Enforcement Centre for the Legal Consequences of Crimes.
This appropriation is intended to cover the expenditure of the European Parliament and of the Council on the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2000.
The social work in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Espacios Púbicos and 3x1 for migrants may not be over where to record serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda reported.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that even though the construction programmes have so far progressed, they are in a risk situation, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions that exceed 11 million weights in the three programmes.
He reported that the total investment of these three programmes was approximately 50 million weights, of which the State had to provide 25 per cent and only the Federation and the Municipality had so far provided resources for the works, thus allowing for a delay in their completion.
"They have to make a contribution of 12 million, and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they have not given us anything, even if since July they had to give us a share," he says, "and we, in order not to record delays, have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the government had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to operate and this year, in order to have access to these programs, we had to get the resources to cover what the State had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment by the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had made a request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management so that the corresponding percentages would reach as soon as possible.
"They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they have given us nothing."
The valid court "the analogous cut" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogous signals by digitals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) raised the constitutional disputes that the Senate and the House of Deputies had voiced against the presidential decree that preceded the so-called "analogous coupe" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes necessary for the disabled were not met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his mandate when he issued a decree detailing the actions to be taken to complete the transition to terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was raised for failure to reach the qualified majority of eight votes in order for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation on radio and television is a statutory assignment to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies have promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions provided for by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of the Ministers also resolved to initiate the complaint made by the House of Deputies, without discussing the project of which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I no longer consider that it would affect the autonomy of the governing body", and he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the government's constitutional mandate.
The replacement of analogous signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years and this translates into a better operation of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
Adding the change, he argued, would be adding the benefits of digitisation, which involves a decision of public interest which does not only have a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, " require the operation of any system established, in accordance with the principle of economic governance of the State, to include a group of powers conferred by the Constitution on the authority of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital transition and had done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has in some way invaded the sphere of competence of Congress, as it ensures in the administrative sphere that the laws issued by the Legislative Act are respected.
The possibility of a "vote by vote" discount was analysed in Michoacán
According to the data provided by PRIP, the difference between the first and second seats of the Governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to 879 out of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The "vote by vote" discount is a reality with regard to the electoral trial this year in Michoacán, where, according to the data provided by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP), the difference between the first and second seats of the Governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting the votes corresponding to 879 out of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llandal Zaragoza, recalled that a number of days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonise local standards for federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán has not approved either its Political Constitution or its Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the State Congress has approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this electoral process to enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Range has failed to publish it within the time limits provided by the Official Journal of the State Act, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State Secretary for Constitutional Reforms, because he did not have the right to "sanction or challenge them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llandal said that through the adoption of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the EMI, it will be possible to make the partial and total counting of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages may be: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of vote and no record of the hour is in the chair; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all polling hours may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winning the respective election and the candidate who obtained the second position in the poll is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition by the party representative and/or coalition who presented the second of the candidates reported.
The total voter count can also be made if at the end of the common count it is that the difference between the alleged winner and the second-place candidate is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the political party from which the second-party candidate is removed, in which case the electoral packages that were subject to the partial count are excluded.
It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PRSP, the difference between the first and second seats is only 0.16 per cent, even without accounting for the votes of 129 of the 923 total verbatim records.
His Last Will
His ashes will be spread in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, confirming the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive at Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday at night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a mass of rest.
According to his family, the last intention of the lieutenant-colon was to spread his ashes in the Sierra de Zapalinamé.
After receiving the awards of the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on the edge of an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
In the middle of the morning, Lieutenant-Colonel's ashes arrived at the guard chapel of the Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where the family and friends had returned.
At 17:30 a.m., he was awarded awards to the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former technology baccalaureate colleagues and the American football team, which was part of Felipe Bacio when he was preparing for the baccalaureate.
"He would like to return to Saltillo and his ashes to be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the Lieutenant Colonel had realized all his dreams, she felt that he was in the fullness of his life, "he had success, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and cared for his family a lot."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some people couldn't believe it, because they said he even had a bad truck, but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "because he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopan for the graduation of his father, so he knows that his uncle is dead by doing what he loved most in life: piloting an aircraft.
Last seen
In honour of his visit to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, he was honored by Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and was distinguished in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, alongside the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six others, all of the officials of the service.
The rest of the Bacio Cortés pilot born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 to be handed over by the funeral to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the group's schedule, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other parents, students and teachers.
Three abandoned bodies, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for organized crimes.
Three men were found murdered at gunshots fired in different parts of the body and with the grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km from Cadereyta road in Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who have gone through this place have observed that in the property, whose closure has beige color and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking at the inside, at approximately three metres, they located the corpses of three persons, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side there was another with a white T-shirt, with shoes.
At a distance there was another person's body with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were stretched on the belly.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another location, as there had been no pain in situ.
In the closing of the property there were legends addressed by a group of organized crime to the other, besides a few dance orifices in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that would operate mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to have relations with kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (monitoring) and clandestine inhumation.
According to the information published, eight people were arrested in the Los Alveros colony on 11 November, and one who had been deprived of liberty was rescued.
Three buildings and a cell phone were confiscated; they claimed to be part of the criminal group called "The Zetas".
In another event that took place on 12 November at 06:00, military personnel took a surveillance course in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without a registration plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13 to 14:00, one of his colleagues was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the soldiers.
They are attributed to clandestine inhumation in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on board the economic disaster and put the whole of the Eurozone at risk.
A communiqué of the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in his majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will take up his position.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his discussions with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "frame is now well drawn", he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy was combating a political and financial crisis that has led to the cost of its debt at levels impossible to support.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to move, the instability of the markets to place the performance of the Italian BTP's obligations 10 years above 7 per cent, the level to which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian boss Confindustria, told the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's success prospects have been greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, to which the crisis forced its resignation last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the right-wing party, told the press.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have been opposed to the Government of the technocrat majority formed by Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be reforms of unpopular austerity.
Any blocking or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by noting that a Monti failure would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He'll finish his round of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano on Sunday, which enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief repetition at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now come to critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defences in Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the generalized predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections begin.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that he should be trained only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a financial pressure-forced process.
Political sources have indicated that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish experience is higher than that of Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers known as Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 invited attended 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to Costa Rica's, if we compare the 22 called by both countries for today's Amical Today, at 15:05, at the San José National Stadium.
While national and European champions, the number one of the FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a wide record of class A inter-selective games, the Tricoloure has only the defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in the powerful clubs of the First League of England maintain an intense activity in national league championships and coups and disputes in European matches such as the League Champions.
To this end, you need to add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complex eliminations of the European Cup and the World Football.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have limited international experience in an area, such as the Conccaf, which is considered to be a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the Iker Casillas target guard, who on the previous Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) compared the record of the former Andoni Zubizarreta target guard, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's brain pilot, at 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized last week by UEFA next to the other hundreds of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the front centre of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Near the centenary number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inesta, with 62; Cec Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umana are the left-hand side of Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the Bryan Ruiz buffer, with 45.
After this, only five have exceeded 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even arrive at 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not start yet.
The historic buster of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who registers the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of trekking
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They waited for more than 20 years, but the group assured them that it would also become a dream to happen in that country.
It is that the bassist and founder member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-departure celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only stage in Central America.
This day will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles The X group and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract from the conversation, with full transcription in La Naziono on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will take place in Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality. Are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and has so far been great.
I went to Costa Rica only once; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So it makes us feel like bringing our music down there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message for your hottest ones?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took us 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so long and we're sorry that it took so long to get to that concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've had in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We offered two giant shows in Sao Paolo and we hope this has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really eager to produce it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfers and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; this is how we learned it through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never been produced there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse catalogue.
You never repeat the catalogue.
What's this all about?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each loves different songs, that's why it's very hard to choose which songs to interpret every night.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we have not interpreted for a long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we love these songs and that we may have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting to us and therefore I think it becomes more interesting to people.
With this tour, you will celebrate 20 years of trekking.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've succeeded?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us had imagined that we were going to form a big rock group, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to recount our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together makes us very excited.
We love and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't go any better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
This has always been an honor for us to be part of this large group.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement emerges from a group of friends and is not common.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in their tour, so we're lucky to be still friends with them and it's an honor to be part of this sound of Seattle that has come up.
It is as strange as a group like yours to keep together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and this is only much longer than many groups normally do.
First of all, I believe that we are all able to be alive and secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and this could not go any better.
Your relationship with the famous word has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If you do not forget that people are there for music, this helps us not to forget that you must respect music and what it has brought, without taking into account the fact that you are famous and a rock star, which does not really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first this was great.
We have been a group for almost three years and have not published a record before Andrew Woods' death.
There have been many frustrations because it has lasted so little and most importantly is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being, and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose him for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with various proposals and that was the group we loved the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer directly and this must be very distracting.
Why do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's the one who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There's so much...
Among the first I remember was Geezer Butler, John Enwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to maintain the grunge in spite of the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the grunge word.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the groups I have just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have emerged at the same time and, if that's relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's a music that's worth listening to and the groups like Mudhoney doing the best music now than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What does this change have to do with?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe qualified as very dark songs, even though they can sound a little positive.
With the two, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you're big and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or a friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, represent this for me.
I also think that one can be happy and even as one can make music dark.
Peru:
again hospitalized Fujimori for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he presents in his feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who spends 25 years in prison for violations of human rights committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various diseases, including a language cancer for which he has been operated four times and which is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, stated for Canal N of television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in its lower members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, he no doubt said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
It has been operated four times as a language cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kilograms, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a pancreas coast, kidney calculations, arterial hypertension and foot circulation problems, has listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been in the National Police Special Operations Branch since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons due to an army annihilization squad that has operated underground during the first years of his government.
Mujica travel to Mexico to consolidate political ties
An official court, headed by the Uruguayan President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and employers, will launch a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and discuss the political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda issued by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proposal for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France, which took place when French envoy Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude countries that continue to be tax havens from the international community, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador from that European country.
Since November, Mexico has presided over the G20, a group of emerging and more developed countries in the world, and has entered into force with the South American country, since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan Government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements to emerge from the "gray list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is integrated by countries that do not meet all international tax cooperation standards.
On a commercial basis, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 in a Treaty of Free Trade (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu plumbing passes to the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought, unfathomable, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil Bowser's grips, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of young people in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to stores from around the world, was designed from the beginning to exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character that must say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally designed for this support", because so far success such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" was adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid part.
Alvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less skilled users.
Once it is over, the most experts will be able to make a "second round" at game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to actually choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to be able to overcome the various challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario into the three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a mobile console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes an eyebrow to the saga fans and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustachu plumbing has to go through minor platforms of danger to release Princess Peach.
Even if I am a player I find novelties in movements, environments, customs and enemies and also in Luigi's "playable".
Colom takes advantage of Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States' conspiracy for the whitening of US$70 million.
So it ends the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that called for Portillo to judge it.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was independent of the judicial and executive power, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his term of office, "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and he had run all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did was an executive approach after exonerating all the judicial and constitutional authorities to judge the former mandate of the 2004-2004 period.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and having guaranteed its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for the disbursement of Q120 million funds in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinidad helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity is born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The review of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijouve social support unit is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
This adds to the long-term employment rate of the current social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of a celebrated event in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinidad Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people who are not trained, without work, with toxic or marginalized problems.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of officials from entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The variety of political representations, in the full election season, showed the unitary nature of the work performed by Trinijouve.
With the President of the Regional Government of Catalan (Generalitat), Arthur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act by former Minister of Social Education, Ernest Maragall and former Deputy Mayor to the mayor and current Eco-socialist councillor Richard Goma.
We also attend in the large Fabra i Coats room the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the charity director at La Caixa, Jaume Lanspa.
But he said that Trinijouve was born in a very difficult time and the current one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijouve as an example to know how to deal with the bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it accomplishes," he said.
Ownership inspected by squatters for micro-fests, evacuated
The invaders were suitable for 11 of the 13 buildings in Balmes, 51
The 12 inhabitants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
It seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of Rue Balmes 51 lived was over.
Twelve people voluntarily left at noon yesterday the property they were illegally occupied and where they organized micro-fests that would disappoint neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for a police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door window was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
"From this day on, there will be access control," said the administrator.
The squatters, which had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - carried out the electrical installation and part of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving residues of any kind, especially alcoholic drinks.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and disappointed the tenants.
Alongside the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europe Press that since the building's occupation, her case has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made him of unfair jurisdiction, because they sold the glass to three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure area had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors for the noise, while according to this, the trouble was not caused by the clients of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants at the festivals organized there, which were more frequent and intense in the past weeks, according to the wrong neighbors of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the nuns were so large that she even made an agreement with the owner of the building that it was nine months ago that he "forgives" the rent.
The Urban Guard (Municipal Police) has also confirmed that over the past few weeks they have received more complaints from neighbors about this situation.
The president of the mayor's municipal group, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end with the problems of life in common and civil life that it caused to residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all apartments and that there were also flights in some apartments.
It is in this sense that he added that "there must be an end to impunity and be implodable against the anti-social behaviour generated in the property".
Yesterday too, Mossos (the Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police moved to Rue Mont-ral's number 35 after receiving the call from a neighbor who had noticed that four people were accessing the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Coherent architects on the opportunity of calling beyond the controversy on honors
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, in the middle of the Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this administration has printed the promotion posters of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the main park of the Metropolitan Barcelone.
In addition, it also included a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park again became, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not focus on the north-south axis, otherwise high (mountain) - low (more).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park unless Yellowstone, with bleedings in the role of Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 competitions for all access doors in Collserola.
A door leads to the idea of the park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to the reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation among all the architects in Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme of which two members of this former cast of elites speak when they are recognized in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions that three architects from Barcelona, university professors, have come up with.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The competition is appropriate.
For Roldán, after discussing the coastal front "it is necessary" to discuss "the mountain front" because the talk of Ildefons Cerda, that of green houses, was not completed.
"It must come from the base that Barcelona's most extensive park is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," he gave the verdict the architect for which the title of "Collserola Gates" contains a "lexical piece": it should not be thought of "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which action must be taken".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers arising from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience of the '80s and had in the Forum's "sing song".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the boundaries on which to build.
"Limiting something means setting up the next step already," that is, its overcoming.
"New urban and planning instruments need to be considered, because the current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP) ] can create real disasters."
With more attention to the question, Modol believes that by simplifying the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity the mayor offers to his corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he believes that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the exception that allows architects to enter the debate, but "questions" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all success", he says) that we have to create it: "We, the architects, should only be an instrument."
Bayona points out that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because the bases of the competition there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 cross-sectional competitions - he says - in the mountain-side sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that leads and understands the area as a whole".
This, at least in this case, has chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project for one of the doors can be shocked in the program and defined with the architect of the nearby door.
In her opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately exceeds that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a mild transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of temporary arrest, the legal authority of the Casino Red granted the pardon to the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmails
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founding of the legal authority of the Casino Red gives him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Tribunal of the District, which follows a trial to blackmail the mayor of Monterrey.
After the assassination of the Royal Casino, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which the alleged Manuel Jonás required payment of an economic quota so that the Mayor of Monterrey would allow the clandestine operation of the game house.
After the public declaration, the Parquet opened a criminal trial against Major PANIST's brother and on 2 September he was arrested and detained temporarily for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Department's Agent 3 of Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the capital of the State.
It remained there for the next 49 days when a second order of detention was issued after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs had committed crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the criminal centre of Cadereyta allegedly for singing with a million and a half weight of the owners of the Casino Red; but he spent only a few hours in the centre of medium-security detention because there were threats of death against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, a catch order was issued by the Registrar of the Second District Penal Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as that relating to the laying of 1.5 million weights of the house representatives in exchange for his operation.
This Monday, the foundation of the legal authority of the Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, was presented by Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; thus he could recover his liberty within the next hours.
During the legal formalities, the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who members of the game house had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
According to case 197/2011, the legal pardon was granted to Jonás Larrazábal and then no claim can be made concerning the trial intended against him; no damages and no punishment will be sought.
After hearing the foundation of the legal authority of the house of the game, at 15:50 a.m., the immediate freedom of Larazabal Breton was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to San Nicolas de los Garza prison to communicate to Jonah that he had been legally forgiven and his case would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the order of immediate liberty issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome communicates the details of the air accident in which he lost his life the secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven others
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons lost their lives indicate that the helicopter has hit the ground directly in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the palaces had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuse."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it met the requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact area did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In research it has been reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact has been structurally presented.
"The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
For the time being, the secretary has made sure that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation may take a few months, it may even take a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, has ensured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential State operated at a speed to cruise and this happened on a rising ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal operation cruising at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, the SCT holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual volume:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to visual flight rules, which implies that the crew must have visibility during flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the ACM referred to adequate conditions for decoupling, and to the fur and as the aircraft moved to the border area between DF and the state of Mexico there were low-level nebulosity layers.
Selected paths:
It is likely that due to the conditions of nebulosity, the crew sought a lower area of height and more visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Impact location.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the random radar, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has taken place on a right and lateral path.
The aircraft remains dispersal model allows the helicopter to assume that the ground temperature has been reached in structural integrity conditions.
No traces of fire or explosion were detected:
In the place of the crash there is always no trace in the rest of the aircraft of an explosion or fire type.
The latest findings of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the groundwork, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9 billion 200 feet above the average sea level, and the ground had a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of slope.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was possibly disarrayed during its journey.
Information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area than the surrounding area, there were no dispersal parts of the aircraft, which bore the assumption that the impact was taken under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the Protocol 'Genetics of Obsessiveness of Children and Adolescents', which will enable the markers associated with overweight.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital des Specialties of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social assistants had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and third-cycle students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation invites the population with or without the right to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the evidence is provided to minors every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity took place in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independent Sports Unit (South of Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (North of Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that it knew the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity and to identify in children and young Mexicans risk factors to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Diabetes Day was to be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal was to gather three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food-related questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and past family heritage of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that cause such disorders as diabetes or renal impairment.
He explained that Saturdays will be applied to all participants in anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference of size), blood pressure, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarm taking weight in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in only six years there was an increase of 77 per cent in obesity in boys and 47 per cent in girls; in the case of overweight, a dramatic increase was also observed', the IMSS specialist stressed.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers was based on the fact that the population of the country was different from others in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent of Indo-American heritage, 30 per cent of Europe and five per cent of Africa, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, obesity genetics translates into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calorie), which is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which allows them to detect whether they are overweight or obese.
It even says that the presence of more dark colors (anthosis) on the neck and front arms indicates the likelihood of metabolic and even pre-diabetic alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and doctors provide it in writing to parents, to whom each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle that they need to achieve in order to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use transport means instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the largest consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - meat paste to maize flour wrapped in corn leaves - bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid cassis
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of the environmental and temperature conditions.
If the signals that the pope had been resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cases each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of Valle de México, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who ensured that if the process of building and maintenance of the bituminious papal is adequate, the cases could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on cassis, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve performance, and therefore the training of the case.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphalt, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called maltene, which together give the pope its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of the asphalt is that at high temperatures, almost 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees C, its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes falling, it adds.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineering specialist warns.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City were mostly covered by a flexible paving, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more surface layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and later compacted.
Each of the small stones that forms the layer, signals it, is bathed an asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well in the paddle.
If there was a modified asphalt, they would be better spread to the chemical engineer.
On the layer of asphalt, he said, a last layer called asphalt, made in fine stone, that is, of the sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the layer of asphalt and provide the adhesion in the street.
As part of the paddle that receives and distributes the effort, the roller layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made must be provided.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, because they significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil moves, the water spreads within the layer it is difficult for it to get out of it, which brings down all the layers of the straw and therefore causes the cassis.
In the process of formation of a case, he said, the first to go is the rolling film and only later is the asphalt layer affected, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be cared for to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of cassis and therefore the thickness of each pare layer must always be linked to the loading of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent cassis formation.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bitumen emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow for easy repair of the case and without having to use high temperatures.
What's missing from Valle's candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives her princess's number 14.
Once again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the fact that she was on the winner's podium, wearing the crown of money and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is raised with the crown and the sceptre, the department already has 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who are near the crown but have been proclaimed princesses, among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today, the big question that many people ask is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the loss of a great favor that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been chosen in vain Queen of the Police and Best Vision Jolie of Vogue, of the titles obtained by the Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the decision taken by the jury of the First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Martín Murillo Gomez, of the Cartreta Literaria Leamos.
Here's the answer from the candidate of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I think enough in literature, I think it's a form of culture, I definitely think that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince," it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read "crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
This answer was not first of all because of the term "culturalize" and secondly in order not to explain specifically how each book quoted it had marked it.
But at the end of Melina's ceremony, she said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wisdom, what must happen.
And for everyone, read, please, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses launched there is the one according to which Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogota stated that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary prices (Oster Gastronomy Challenge, the public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "it woke up the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen, and that is why she did not shine on the scene".
And this was noted in its first presentation in the bathroom at Hilton Beach and its two parades of the coronation watch.
Although she had assured the two paraders of her own, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the program "Como en casa" (As at home), of the Canal RCN stated that the fact that Melina was designated a princess "confirms that the candidate who receives most of the prizes during the contest does not receive the crown of queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the jury of its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we need to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, which is already involved in projects before the competition starts," she explained.
It is also said that Valle has sinned by his faults behind him and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because that is precisely why the jury chose him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
The Queen's Preparation Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledged that Melina had no better body, that there was better, "but her problem with fibrosis on the abdomen, which in fact had not been too familiar to me, left her points the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine considers that the error of the Valle candidate was the surgical interventions she had received.
"The surgery is good, but Valle didn't have to do it.
Her body has never been her asset and she has lost it because of this aspect."
At this price, that the National Beauty Competition returned for the first time, after the dance in the bath-bed, a cruel prediction that took place last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina not to give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina today begins a year of rule, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by appointment of the National Competition.
However, she will go through history as one of the queens who, despite her bluffing passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
This was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A dactyloscopicist from Cali has gone on to history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4th, a CTI dactyloscopicist from Cali went on to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chief of Farc: "Alfonso Cano", comparing his fingerprints.
Seven dactyloscopes working in the ITC's local offices this week were the "availability" tour of Eliaszar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Choco, where he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after having followed appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscope, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. the thumbs and feet.
During the week of the operation against Alfonso Cano alias, Eliezer was warned to take with him clothes for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected of being the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the site of the body, he did not recognize it by his physical appearance, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed as a peasant of the area, without glasses and much more lean.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian wolf, from the Incre, a lift and a lantern, Eleazar compared the body's digital prints to those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
On the same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzón that he was the Supreme Chief of the Farc.
Looking for the print
For a dactyloscope of Sijén de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made in Eliaszar González at a press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without a margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, the dactyloscopeists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals have false identity cards or no documents.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher said that in a flight case he had to remove a part of the wall from a house, because in this place the thief had held his hand to make out a chest full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a digital print, but in this case we were able to get the print from the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he recalls.
The fingerprints may also exclude or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of beer around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a parent could be suspected of crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even though this does not guarantee that he is the murderer, it is the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactyloscopicist explained that "the digital prints of objects with chemical or physical reactives" were extracted.
When they appear, we use a lift or a band to pick them up.
Later, the prints were sent to Asif, the delicators' database, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers," the CTI expert said.
He explained that everything is not how it is shown in the CSI TV program.
As everything that shines isn't gold, everything that touches is not necessarily a print.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "indiged" defends the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were crammed in front of the Zucotti square to camp there.
A large part of the people entered the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday, trying to reenter, thanks to a judicial order, in place of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Pompey.
Hundreds of demonstrators were in front of the Zucotti square, where they wanted to access a court order that allowed the 'indignees' to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a more park in the north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the place, we're going to settle in another place and we're going to continue the legal struggle to return to Zucotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "Occupe Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the answer of the 'indignees' to the evacuation of their camp, personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the site and allowed protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignees' occupied a new park located in the confluence of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, which is owned by the Trinity Church, New York and New Jersey.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved in and arrested some demonstrators, even though Bray was unable to confirm the particular figure, ensuring the effect of seeing some journalists who had also passed the maneuvers.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who have settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved in support of the members of the movement and has tried to intervene in their behalf before the Police.
Meanwhile, the Zucotti Square - which is a private property building - remains closed waiting for the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled by this Tuesday during which the lawfulness of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some demonstrators so far moved and distributed copies of this court order at that time, and they even delivered it to the officers who were monitoring the scene, which caused 'some small confrontations', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officers had hit the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting the members of Occupy Wall Street or from applying 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or from prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with tents or other properties they used previously'.
Major Bloomberg pointed out in front of the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and demonstrators, but he warned that local laws did not allow them to be installed with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn at Zucotti, an operation during which 200 persons were arrested and which was decided because the demonstrators were 'voiling the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the place to be evacuated because it became "a place where people didn't come to protest, but to violate laws and in some cases, to harm others", because "some shops had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation of this morning at dawn has been repudiated and shows that the Bloomberg fund is more interested in defending financial interests than those of American workers," adds the motion spokesman, who accuses the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
The "Occupe Wall Street" officials also indicated that they do not intend to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television program of Noel
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in Home Improvement, reliefist in "Baywatch", lapin in "Playboy", married to rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of Noel from Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, next to the "croner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released in the television program "It's Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide Internet dissemination of a private porn video in which she appeared with her husband at that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary, supporting in a cross a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian comedian who recently introduced a part of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appeared like Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special program of Noel de CTV also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, which is not far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian 'pute' during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Retired After Earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of decline from the beginning of March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralysing, still colluding after the earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo estimated the material losses of $300,000, which, despite the difficult global context, seems to have been reduced.
After three consecutive trims of falls, data from the Gross Domestic Product between July and September have been used to finally turn the page: GDP has increased 1.5% compared to the previous trimester and 6% at annual rates.
The second quarter recorded - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - assumes, in addition, the largest rate of increase since January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and later tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1%, compared to a decrease of 0.9% of the capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real incentive of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites to benefit from the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructure, to use the scarcity to create zero.
Japan has been awake mainly by the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable has increased by 1%, driven by increased expenditures on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The Yen stigmatize
Tokyo went into the internal market when the yen - the Nippon currency - became one of the "refugees" elected by the investors who were the debt crisis in the euro area and the unforeseeable forecasts of the United States, a privilege that is a delay in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic fleet line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their low performances between July and September.
While the markets continue to sit in the peripheral EU countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not fall in guard.
"There is a need to monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of the flooding in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa, yesterday.
And indeed, prospects are not quite encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the world economy's inflation points highlighted that the main powers are being inhibited.
Because it dropped four decimals to 100,4 points, compared to 100,8 a.m.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is at 100 levels, not lowering eight decimal places up to 99.13 points.
Athens again feeds doubt
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but the conservators will not sign any written commitments
With the risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to join the labyrinth leading to the outbreak of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, yesterday, pointed out that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days set out in his appointment could be short to apply, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, would ensure that he did not go to support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his requirement for new elections for the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," said Papadimos when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reform the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the Samaras message does not give rise to doubts about its position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more."
The conservative leader went a step further in his pockets than the EU and the IMF, the agencies that need to unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needed, and clearly said that he would not approve any letter of commitment to the adjustment.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the whole Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and leaders of the main Hellenian parties do not sign "a written commitment without doubt as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika inspectors would return to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements needed to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there was no final date.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen underlines Spain's "preparative" position with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a world-leading place in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofía recalled that in the last two decades, the country has become the world's second donor in terms of this instrument of cooperation whose " essence" resides in the fact that it is "an instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all mankind, based on confidence in the human being".
The Queen opened yesterday the World Microcredit V Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "an absolute necessity" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals for 2015, and, "more specifically, in the one that aims to reduce half the volume of people living with incomes under a dollar per day, to which the poverty line is set".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who hoped that initiatives and contributions from the Summit, which will extend to Thursday, "guarante the creation of new capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "a lot of goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" should be promoted.
Thus, His Majesty explained that by the end of 2015, there are 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and 100 million of these families come from the poverty line in which they now live.
The inspiration in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneer way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Queen Sofia as a "act of justice and recognition of two".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "beautiful idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work of which she had known since 15 years ago when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to observe a continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him the qualifying "family head" meeting in Valladolid of the "poor banker" yesterday.
Finally, Queen Sofía ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in seeking solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, she stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, because it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered microcredit as "a serious and rigorous policy for poverty eradication", and now "more than ever" the governments of the developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not allow it to be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for development".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the "success" to give "trust" to the "excluding those to whom everyone closes the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors of the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian-Democrat Union (CDU) Congress in Leipzig on Monday, November 14, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, a chancellor but also chairman of the Christian-Democrat party.
Europe's future was not originally planned for the programme, but it was imposed in the fall, especially to satisfy the militants who judge the government's policy too laxistic towards the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Management Board, was adopted in almost unanimous terms.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, following their intervention, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, left no doubt.
The idea-master of the chancellor - and of the motion - is in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less than Europe but more than Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "time has come from a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to the universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe".
This is, in any case, one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Septs will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and CDU leaders believe Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the jalon is set.
Similarly, delegates rejected to a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country to the European Central Bank on the basis of the weight of each economy, which, of course, would increase the weight of Germany.
The chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it has not sought to win its congress on the back of European "little" countries or countries in difficulty that are quick to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe is one paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except for a creux.
Remembering that there were two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What is the fraud of disease arrests?
After the allocations, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be at Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allocation box, and to give a talk on the theme - which has been in use since 2007 - of combating social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which is part of a willingness to make savings in a harsh context, but is not less advert to an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on disease arrests.
First of all, in a budget economy: the government plans to impose a fourth day of deficiency on private employees before taking care of a job arrest.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, a sick worker loses four days of pay, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could cause anger, but that would make it possible to report 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And who would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic: to impose a non-indemnity day on employees in the event of a job arrest (they do not have so far a period of disability, compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also reopens the subject of fraud, targeting the abuses related to job arrests this time.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will be refunded," Xavier Bertrand warned the RTL micro, on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the ad effects seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud at work arrests.
This has been the subject of constant and offensive political monitoring since 2002.
The French are no more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's wait for the national figures first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million Euros of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Research and Documentation, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008 with EUR 11.3 billion.
On this basis, 46% concerned maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% concerned sick leave, or EUR 6.2 billion.
And so 2.5 per cent of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days of job arrest, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by Monster.com career management site, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any sick leave days.
Another study, this time of the Disease Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of the disease arrests were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months, and 11% above.
When compared with their European neighbours, the French employees are no longer inclined to stop working.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two NRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for reasons of health or non-health) in France was between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud of disease arrests is very small compared to the work in the black.
With regard to fraud, she's only reaching a small extent.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks on disease arrests for more than 45 days.
In 2008, over 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 made for short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, 11% of cases were "unjustified or unjustified" of 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, 169,000 "unjustified" cases involving several million employees who have had a disease arrest.
A figure that represents very little of a face, for example, that of work in black.
According to MPP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on the issue in June would represent 9-15 billion euros of tax losses per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus more than fraud to the latter.
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
This is what the Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said in front of Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the hundred days given to his union government would not be enough to carry out this task.
"In order to continue our efforts to restore the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment," said the head of government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote on confidence in Parliament Wednesday.
The implementation of decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is in play", he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos planned that the country's public deficit would be reduced "to around 9 per cent" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The right to refuse new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, supported him on Monday with the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not engage in an additional austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the members of his party, New Democracy.
It agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who has predicted that the IMF and the EU will not unlock the loan of EUR 8 billion needed without written guarantee to all parties that they would support the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his speech was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, says an expert committee
Canadians live in the deni of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, in addition to cancer.
Canadian society lives in the demise of death.
Only 9% of Canadians accept to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make provision for this.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the choice is made, to a qualified patient to make such a decision.
At the start of the game, experts cite a recent survey by the United Intelligence Economist, who compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
If Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that "death medicalization in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death".
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we report the experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire that most Canadians die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, it is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that there is nothing to change the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide involving persons who are not competent or consenting.
On the contrary, Mr Downie, co-founder of the report, said yesterday at a teleconference, there would be more cases of these clashes in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians favoring euthanasia
Let us recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it would allow people to ease their suffering in the end, according to an Angus Reid survey carried out in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the life of the elderly or the disabled is less valuable.
With regard to persons who have committed suicide, the polls believe that they should not be prosecuted.
In the case of maintenance or discontinuation of care in a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Thus, in the list of their recommendations, they suggested that it be indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there was a legally valid refusal is not a criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect a non-life care refusal, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the field of palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, in addition to cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or terminal sedation, which has already been widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some health experts have already issued reservations regarding the findings of the report of the Royal Society of Canada experts.
Me Pierre Deshamps, a health specialist, qualified as "extreme" the position of the signatory experts in the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminal disease.
"It opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who had been over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide," said Me Deshamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
I also stress that the authors of the report seem to place the individual's autonomy above all the other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But, "in society, he says, there are bullets and constraints."
The health specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "pro-euthanasia manifest."
Margaret Somerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly opposed to the report on the absence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, both in the Netherlands and in Oregon.

Bachhar al-Assad's supporters appeared yesterday at the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure was intensified yesterday on Syria of Bachar al-Assad, which, with the support of Russia, resists them and denounces a "competence" against the country.
Two days after Syria was suspended by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, took a stand in favour of the departure of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call President Bachar al-Assad to "get the power" in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime's forces were still killed.
"If Bachhar had the interest of his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighboring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For its part, Turkish diplomacy leader Ahmet Davutoglu has regretted that Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, alluding to Syria, a neighbouring country in respect of which Turkey adopts an increasingly hard line.
The United States welcomed a "strengthening consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, of countries such as Turkey, adopt an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, Mark Toner, a spokesperson of the Department of State, observed.
During that time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces perished in the Deraa region in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians were killed in the city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem felt, however, that the country was "directed to the end of the crisis".
He also has a strong response to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damas from his work, which he considers to be a "dangerous step".
Syria "do not flinch," he added, ensuring that "the plots against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe also supported the sending of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he felt is in "paranoia".
A new special meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces of the prosecuting cities to the challenge and release of the arrested protesters.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, held yesterday that the decision of the Arab League was "inaccurate", while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while maintaining its support for any sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti Demands Time for Italian Markets and Sacrifices
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, called for some time in the markets to train his team and implement a program that will contain "victims" to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussions with the political parties yesterday before today meeting the trade unions and the patronage.
It should set up a relatively restricted office composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the interviews, after meeting with the President of the Council appointed.
The President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said for his part that Mario Monti asked for a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr. Monti's presentation of a limited list, no doubt a dozen ministers, to the head of the State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bonds yesterday, demanding them from time to time.
In "democracy, there is a precise time" to prepare a government and its programme, he stressed, saying, "some of the markets will be patient and understanding."
His appointment by the President had been initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern over it was over in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister appointed should be a team comprising, in particular, technocrats, even though he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislation.
According to the President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti has, once he has become operational, committed himself to working in the urgency and in order that Italy "becomes a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance objective in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for, in particular, new rigour measures.
The Italian "pattern" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit parameters".
Mr. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the serious challenge" and another "Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy will have to place by April 2012 for EUR 200 billion of state bonds.
A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a useful detonator with a nuclear weapon, said on Monday an American NGO specialized in atomic risk.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported last week on its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, which was widely available in IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk, Ural, and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company producing nano-diamants in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then have cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, prior to his return to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA refers to "strong indications that the development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system "was assisted by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technique well but who, as a Member State informed it, worked during the main course of his career in this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased from almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence slightly decreased or slightly progressed, according to the FBI's public statistics on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, 49 per cent increase, against a 13 per cent increase in Catholic violence, a 4 per cent decrease in crimes against Jews and a total increase of 14 per cent in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has significantly increased to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which are motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," said the Human Rights Organization First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," he added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," adds Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses," he adds, believing that this could lead to an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in American federal law is a legacy of the time of the fight for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish racial violence, skin color, religion, origin and now sexuality.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging Twitter site introduced on Monday changes in its platform presentation, allowing its users, in particular, to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service a little more similar to that of Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" allow you to follow more legibly, directly the activity of the other "Twittos", the netizens followed by the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast throughout the network on Monday, AFP indicated Twitter's password, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to rediscover someone else's message, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making the initiative's happiness, opens to a wider audience with a more comparable handling than that of the major public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users discussed suddenly "tweets" on the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Activity will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream," @danykronstrom sent.
Austria
registration of a "gold rule" in the constitution
The Government of Great Social-Democratic/Christian Coalition to Power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "gold rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid any degradation by Austrian sovereign rating agencies (triple A).
It is the social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann who even announced this decision on the basis of a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, far above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had been reduced only by one crane, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interest every year," argued the Vice-Chancellier and Christian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindeleger.
Austria therefore submits a request for a summit in Brussels of the eurozone member countries of 26 October last: the Heads of State and Government had then applied for the registration by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and for a return to balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The arrangement adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model", Germany having been the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the federal state's structural public deficit will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states as well as the municipalities will have to submit budgets to balance.
The objective is to transfer public debt to Horizon 2020/21 under the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty.
One Suit
Noda threatens a new intervention on the market for change
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the change market if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene as we did the last time if we detect excessive volatility" in the Yen exchange rate, Mr. Noda explained in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was not far from the historical levels that led the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo has sold large amounts of yen against dollars in order to lower the value of the Nippon currency that had just established a new record of force since 1945 against the green ticket.
But the yen has been regularly raised since, doubled by the purchases of investors who consider it a "refuge value" at this time of uncertain global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was spent on Tuesday under 77 yen and the euro was brought down under the symbol bar of 105 yen, near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis from 2008-2009, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro is over 160 yen.
This fluctuation of the Nippon currency at night for the exports of the Archipelago because it costs the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of foreign revenues from Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan fights to rebuild" since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March that devastated the Tohoku region (North-East), highlighted Mr. Noda, who is afraid that this fertilization of the yen does not kill in the egg the fragile recovery.
The third world economic power has declined with growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in one year, thanks to a wealth of exports and consumption of households flooded by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considered that the purchase of yen did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, for his part, called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting on Tuesday of its monetary policy council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, predicted that BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", making it clear that no additional monetary adjustment was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the Institute of Emissions increased by 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) its cash purchases from the Treasury, making up to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling on the purchases of different financial assets to promote the liquidity market.
Euro area:
rising rates, rising stock exchanges
The risk of the debt crisis is still the European index.
Despite the designation of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of fragile countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are a little more in negative territory on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC lost 40 per cent to 3,064 points.
Dax in Frankfurt is 0.4% and London is 0.1%.
" With the new tensions on the performance of the eurozone's state borrowings in difficulty, the world's stock markets continue to make some of their recent profits."
"The investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contamination," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7%, with renewed fears of market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
" Japan, like the rest of the world, has wide-ranging views on Europe and exchanges will continue in a narrow corridor of variation as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation is stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has evolved to its lowest level for a month and a half.
At around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, reflecting 0.4%.
According to the courtiers, she withdrew after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, gathered at Monday's congress, adopted a motion providing, inter alia, for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Italy and Spain's borrowing rates remain at very alarming levels.
This Tuesday morning, the performance of Italian obligations at 10 years of age is 6.85%, that of Spanish titles of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, called on the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be the " main task " of his government.
Spain is in the market view line, while legislative elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The gap in rates ("spread") between 10 years' obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new higher historical level.
Waiting for growth figures in the euro area
In the statistics, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, which was slightly better than the expected growth of 0.3 per cent of households.
However, the Insee revised the number of the second quarter to a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it's really the fourth one that worries the most economists.
Germany, on the other hand, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must bring it to the dogmas
If it's a subject that can't be dealt with from short-term considerations or under the emotion, it's energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that an electoral meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and on the place where the nuclear is held.
The debate will only be beneficial if it explores the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their views on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic evolution will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless it deprives a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be a need to step up the refurbishment of fossil resources to continue producing "electricity permanently, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a missing topic of the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case with Belgium, which is subject to the need to be able to find a source of replacement that is able to replace itself or Switzerland, which is just about to build only the centres of the last generation.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote only, pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, they, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their park by reviewing the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts the speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in the increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on increased use of imported gas, in particular Russia, a bond of CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
Within a few months, all these false effects are already felt.
Denmark's case is to be considered.
Europe's wind champion, with 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to wind interference; according to which its CO2 emissions and its electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours are paying a 40% higher electricity bill than that of the French households.
While in a globalised economy, the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies have the least expensive electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the nuclear share would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make it illusory to make good statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of the purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, although they do not show any opposition to this energy, the polls show it.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industrial line of 125 000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strongly exportable, it leads to a galaxy of specialized SMEs in international markets and makes them very creative of non-replaceable jobs.
If France had decided to leave the nuclear industry, many of these SMEs would have been sacrificed by reducing the 6 billion euros per year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would command an EPR designed to function for sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of production of "miracle electricity, no more than there is diabolical.
The development by Areva of low-emission solutions of CO2, nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For the nuclear, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a Security Authority that exercises an intransigence and transparent control over existing centres as well as the Flamanville building.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are obsessed with the same security obsession.
In a half-century, the nuclear industry suffered three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, was involved in normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human errors caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that have caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons of this accident, as it had done for the previous two.
This approach and cooperation between the security authorities, French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a concept that enables it to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all the electricians who wish to build a power plant, the conclusion of its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them free to take the lead in the irreversible development of the nuclear power plant.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow the emotion, dogmas and acts of partisan to dominate a debate as crucial for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised in various ways - an increase in police, judicial and administrative services subject to the number policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have done so today, the Minister of the Interior (read Release of May 23) declaring in the passage that France "does not need foreign talent, masonry and restaurant servers".
But it is only rarely analyzed under the economic angle.
There is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right on this subject.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac, who would declare in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't welcome the whole misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by orders of Polish plumbing was shared to the left as well as to the right.
For both sides, immigrants are regarded as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be attributed to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande is able to deal with banalities, indicating that the development of the code development will solve our "migrating problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be selectively paid; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall it in a recent book synthesising the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restrict anemic immigration growth and work night.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are at risk of being replaced by national workers, especially those who are not qualified, with low pay pressure.
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more complementary than national employees, who are mainly engaged in jobs in disadvantaged sectors.
Small-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the job offer.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will have trouble working in a country with a shortage of anesthesiists, these complementaritys between nationals and migrants have a positive effect on national wages and employment.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that an increase of 1% of migratory flows resulted in an increase of 0.6 to 0.9% of real long-term wages.
And this is not to take into account the diversity of immigrants that contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a strong proportion of immigrants naturalized among the American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, with an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, an immigrant aged 30 will make a net contribution of EUR 150,000 to the public budgets on average throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term of office, to look for the missing growth points "with teeth".
The teeth in question, using to discourage immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, still thinking European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for his invention in Athens over two thousand years ago, experienced the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonists in Greece during the 20th century.
Some have believed that it would be sufficient for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies to exercise the vote, and to exercise it as directly as possible.
It is known, since Napoleon "the Little", that this was an easy thought.
The universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition for democracy, is not enough and may even become "an instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Light, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we live in is an economic crisis, but it is, first and foremost, a crisis in politics and democracy.
In this respect, the palinoidity of the true Greek referendum would have had a double value: that of the need for a powerful return to politics, but also that of the feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambiance must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now moved, and for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized in the interests of needs and dispersed order.
A white-sitting to the absolute European monarch or a foot-sitting in the void of the nationalist reply: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want to be a coward, but a common exercise, full of law, serene and continuous, of choice and of democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we could no longer stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is all Europe that is attached to the dictations of markets and rating agencies, which is due to its impunity and its lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but Europe is the whole one who slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore to popular sovereignty the pilotage of the European project.
As a whole, Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free up markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will be decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead to disaster.
After long fighting this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
Let's go.
But thinking about it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new impasse.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
In order to make the Republic of France, the Republic had to "do" the Republicans.
The Revolution in the interests could not be sufficient.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe in economic terms.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe on a political level, a genuine European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
The "without contact" cards are generalized
The world hall of the pizza map opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, SIM card phone...), more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart firm.
The most powerful segment is that of wireless technology that allows you to pay transportation in common or to regulate its purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million cards without contact should be sold around the world, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to continue to grow in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for cards (6,925 million cards).
For a long time at the Asia-Pacific region train, Europe earns land for payment without contact.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the initials are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the big surfaces put double lips.
Carrefour thus issued this year 2.5 million pass MasterCard without contact.
To get to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two large French establishments have committed themselves to spreading systematically in the future to their clients from the bank cards equipped for contact,” says Gérard Nebouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments by mobile
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment for the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with NFC technology (Near Field Communication) needed to carry out transactions.
"They took the delay."
"But they should finally know a real Essor next year."
"Our tables on sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a tube allowing the payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, too, said yesterday to prepare the placing on the market of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile phones.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is spreading
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida and the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
"The way in which the two organizations operate and the reports of the information services show that there is good cooperation," he explained without any further clarification.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French in Niger in January would have updated the passports.
Kidnapped in a Niamey restaurant by near Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day as many of their fans were killed during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the demise of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone holes belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of past calls is aimed at several interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are of particular interest to the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has lived long in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram's berch and the other to a man who is called Aqmi and the sect.
"It's an advance, but we must certainly wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect has benefited from external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex camicas or explosive devices and invoices as well as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, beginning with Washington, therefore pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of little interest.
A Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, school and fundamentalist imman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the northern Muslim of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is rapidly successful.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the career while its militants engage in the fight against the wicked central government.
The latter aim first of all at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's militants were particularly active, multiplying attacks on the commissioners.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, no nuances.
The army is investing in the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, who was arrested alive, was killed in prison.
Then the sect will radicalize and leave its northern flanks.
In the last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 of Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram took it to the security QG of the police during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now concerns all security specialists.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, that the Somalis of al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppe warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all the information".
The World According to Republican Candidates to the Presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete for simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, or simplistic ideas?
To listen to the Republican presidential candidates, the voters could believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying the tone and the shortness of foreign policy, traditionally a strong Republican point.
On China, on Iran, on Israel's help, slogans - often unstated - were met.
Mitt Romney, the best in the race for the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to bring the Chinese before the WTO and challenge them "for the manipulation of their currency", a theme that is a leading theme in an America that is driven by the migration of all the breads of its industry to Asia.
He said that if this should involve the launch of a trade war.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to Obama, and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has failed to break up with an attitude that "flashes" emotions.
He called for a constructive but muscle dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who stands in the depth of the polls, remains unheard of.
To Reagan image
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions failed to stop his nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, he's a fan."
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows him a embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called against the Chinese military threat because Beijing "trys to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently unaware of the fact that China has held military atom since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike against Iran, says he is ready to engage the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign politics.
The opponents of the current president claim that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They remind him that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine on anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, on the too-fast departure of Iraq's "boys", on his riots in Libya, thus bringing him a low label.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The population is rather positive about Obama's national security budget, which has eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been in doubt about military interventions that lead to the enlistment.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to revive its leadership, Obama hits more just.
The North Stream, new entry door for Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, directly connecting Western Europe to Russia by going to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with spark.
More than 500 guests, of whom four Heads of State and Government took part on Tuesday, on the Baltic coast, between orchestra and buffet end, at the inauguration of Nord Stream, this new gas pipeline that connects Russia directly under the sea in Germany.
Symbolically, German chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands Mark Rutte turned together the wheel of the valve leading the entry of the Russian gas into the Western-European network.
With this new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion additional Russian gas cubes will arrive every year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1,224 km connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerian.
A second tube has to be completed at the end of 2012, allowing to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And the possibility of building a third on the same route is already mentioned.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and at the time of this huge construction has victory air.
The project had been strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will, in fact, be able to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh Russia by threatening to close it to Western European markets.
At the strongest of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact ", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But it is at the price of a weakening Europe of energy, as the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has, in five years' time, triumphed over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas-consumers, and whose castings are in decline.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically," said François Fillon, inaugurating this gas pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are both political and economical.
All of this explains the broad smiles displayed by the Gazprom leaders, present in number in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical plant.
The underwater tube is made of concrete steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It is based on the bottom of the sea, at 200 m on average.
To build it, it had to be avoided from the fields of mines dating from the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed by caution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson of Nord Stream.
There was also a need to multiply measures to protect wildlife and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which doesn't interrupt all its length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned outside Sweden, but the project was rejected by the project managers, while the Swedishs were not willing to see a Russian state company permanently established beyond their borders.
"In case of emergency, we stop the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of escape, the gas contained in the gas pipeline therefore escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builders who have planned the probes to know a flight every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the gas pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, which is designed by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
In the form of a cigarette, it is inserted inside the tube, wide of a meter of diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three days of full travel at the speed of 3 meters second, it provides detailed information on any deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without having to make the lowest repair.
The flow of the gas is simply secured by pressure.
It is 200 bars away, and 100 bars on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the parts.
Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as Dutch Gasunie and French group GDF Suez (9% each) joined them.
These five companies created a joint venture, named Nord Stream, to build and operate the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to this company, for 20 years renewable, the total gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was made up of 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work should be EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Switzerland, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to get back to their expenses, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy side planted with pins.
Valves, heights of 4.5 metres, form the gas exit door.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that occurs before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since Tuesday, this terminal has received a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
With full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a stamp.
Created 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to rediscover the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine book is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as old by time.
However, the Moleskine book as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides at the time to launch a design note book.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is responsible for launching the new product.
The book is inspired by an old production technique, the skin dust (skin leather) that denotes a paint cotton used to cover banquets for example.
This type of book was very popular with writers and travelers.
" Moleskine gave the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the pre-gardenst artists, until the 20th century " , says Maria Sebregondi, who has become responsible for the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent to 12.7 million pieces.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It's hard to establish the buyer's robot portrait, as the notebook of notes seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
In the image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitans, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, now almost 100 and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the bookstores, from Fnac to small downtown shops, and has been forced to impose her identity.
"We have followed the weather and this new need for writing, despite e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists exhibit their own book.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Benefiting from its success and from this cultural aura, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, calendar, styles, computer houses... The brand declines on a whole range of supports.
A success that has led to wishful thinking: in the fall of 2006, Mode Mode was purchased by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of people with disabilities is open today.
Despite a voluntary public policy in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is twice as high as the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the population as a whole.
Discouraged?
“No,” said Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, “the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.”
" The progress made for fifteen years has been considerable. "
"At that time, the rate of unemployment was not two but three times higher."
"There is still a great deal to be done. "
It must be said that for people with disabilities, obstacles remain many before access to employment.
Rather, they are older: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the bacca and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for people with disabilities, compared to 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that specifically complicate the return to employment and that "are the core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
This is for the target brakes.
It remains the non-dit, the mentalities that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise Association for the City indicated that the managers interviewed had " a low level of knowledge of the disability " , with a " overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual disabilities " .
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment goal of 6% of disabled workers, as laid down in a law of... 1987.
The last known figures, dating from 2008, account for a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of " taxed " institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
" The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc. "
" But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of the 20 to 49 employees are employed by disabled workers, compared with 82 per cent of the 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What a joy"
Before facing the Blues Tuesday night (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of providing them with this friendly match.
We won't have to write that there was a connection between them, but the image is symbolic.
Assis side by side on the street of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months after the humorous gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian electorate has only praise for his work.
"I am very pleased with Eden, with his progress and with the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go ahead," says Lillois.
As for the contrast between its benefits in the club and selection, "it's a whole, is it justified."
"A Lille, I've been there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I must take my marks."
Arrived against Romania on Friday night for this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brighten".
However, do not ignore the notion of "please".
The Blues have encouraged them since the age of 7 and the successful campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supportive," he says.
This contributes to further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
However, in front of him, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he rappel-it.
"We crossed all the time."
"To play against them is nothing but happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens has for his part referred to the "fire".
"I'll fight a game of gala."
"Fererated" also to find - as a "voisin" - that France is "become a very high-level team" a little more than a year after Knysna's traumatism.
"Laurent Blanc did a tonner job," he was excited.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician will be able to share the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are getting big," he stressed.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You're going to report it in the next match." He's against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Porto de Paulo Bento begins with a lot of optimism in his return to Bosnia (22h00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, the two teams had failed to realize.
" At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selectçao, which has been on the sleeves since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is indeed only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to start.
In view of the match to go (0-0), Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it was obvious that the games were not done.
Portugal has dominated the part for more than an hour, but it has been unable to mark this purpose so precious, which would have relieved it.
"It is a good result, however, that carries a certain risk because we have not marked purpose outside"
But in their bright City of Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of a audience that should be there too bubbling, even though the party announces itself "very closed," said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take over," said the Portuguese coach for 42 years.
"We continue to have 50% chance of being in the Euro 2012 ", but still relativized the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The zero reported Friday in Bosnia obliges Portuguese to mark and win.
A zero can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to mark.
"It is a good result, however, that carries a certain risk because we have not marked purpose outside," said Bento.
"We are going to play against a team that has many technical qualities and has many players with many individual qualities," he added.
Like Zenica, Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on Bosnians to "don't give them time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is realistic, this time.
