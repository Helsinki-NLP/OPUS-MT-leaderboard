Obama received Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
The two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and the destabilising measures in the Middle East.
At the meeting, however, there is also a conflict with the Palestinians and the two-State solution under discussion.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticises the ongoing settlement of Israel and rejects Netanyahu's lack of will in the peace process.
The deal by Obama about the Iranian nuclear programme has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March Netanyahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republicans before the U.S. Congress, which was partly valued as a front against Obama.
The speech was not in agreement with Obama, but a meeting had pointed out that he had rejected his current election in Israel.
In a emergency, Professor, to have shot his girlfriend
In one emergency, Professor Shannon Lamb reported with a somewhat bitter voice from the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that had been criticized on a white block: "I am so sorry, I wanted to make it back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was stated by the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no mention that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school site where he, according to police, shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said that Lamb had made the interfering emergency sometime after.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took the life when the police put him in.
One day after the shooting at the university, the students and teachers forced themselves to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to take a picture of what Lamb motivated them to do.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were pleased with his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people", with which he shared his academic life.
Both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which includes 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a health leave and said that he had any health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The newest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion for which the Lamb had worked so hard would not provide him with a guarantee for an automatic way to a job as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After the flight from campus, the police found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb himself killed a .38 Caliber gun at the back of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still on the way.
It wasn't immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she thought he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He promoted teaching in the spring.
One of the longtime friends of Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when she met with friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to play her guitar for a few years.
He was the woman's warmth at the time.
All the girls smack there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and in Jackson Brandon's capital.
Lamb and Prentiss evidently were together for some time.
In the Notruf, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no warrant from a hero.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the backstein house, which was bound to a bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they were divorced 15 years ago, but they had friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old now.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer-year market three years ago.
Later, they played one or other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at night on 5 September for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and oral harmonica game before a special audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and screaming at each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar programme and specialized in American residents and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the Student Committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including teachers, employees, students and members of the community, participated in a Christmas celebration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the mahnwache, while the University's "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The teaching will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to move our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb did the emergency after he shot Schmidt, and that lamb in his emergency was named Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that they've ever married.
Toys R Us plans to set fewer working forces for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas seasonal employees as last year, but the toys and baby products dealer says that he will give the employees and seasonal workers who are currently employed with him a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to set up 40,000 people in shops and sales centres across the country. In the Christmas season 2014, 45,000 workers were set up.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will start with application talks and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to set up time workers to provide supplies to employees who sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment professionally for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a prominent documentary film "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it makes sense to me that I am a simulated giant and an arm length away from being with the princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "unquestionably the biggest time travel film ever turned."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's enhanced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the nearly five years-long conflict, and more weapons will only become more violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief again calls on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to join and support integrated negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - on the side of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the crackdowns in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional authorities "make this situation unresolved."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in the management of the Syrian crisis that they had demonstrated when they reached a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Surveyes that show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have taken him away as a joke.
And some are waiting for a break.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top rankings in surveys down, it hasn't worked yet.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump in the dual area, and some start to wonder seriously what it means for the chances of nominating the property mogul.
Of course it is still too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time Rick Perrys was led to the rising Herman Cain, from which not only won a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's potential and start to let their dollars flow to crush it.
Here are some current surveys that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey of the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six of 10 Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are held in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "welcome" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "barred" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enchanted" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in matters of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "angrily" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticised for his bombing and policing statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temper for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander, says Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform his office effectively, and almost six out of 10 independent say that his temperament does not fit in the White House, so ABC/Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to the idea.
When they set up their teaching shelters, Republican voters keep Trump real.
If they are asked who wins the GOP nomination first, they say four out of ten last week after a survey of CNN/ORC that Trump is the best bet.
That's a change since the time they put their money on Jeb Bush four at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters in the past did not have the clearest crystal ball.
At that time in the last cycle, four of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidate in the middle of Romney.
However, it turns out that a multitude of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the split field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while the anti-Trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey of the Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-and-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump collects the majority support.
He has 13 points in front of Carly Fiorina, 14 points in front of Marco Rubio, 15 points in front of Walker, 19 points in front of Jeb Bush and finally in front of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-on-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would take over the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-and-head race.
A few majority of Donald-Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new survey of CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters supporting the Trump say they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never change the opinion.
46 percent said they let the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the time of the other side, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters, who say that they have formed their opinion, are twice as often for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violent" in his election contest two months ago, immigration was a turning point in the public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombing of Trump's decisive Hispano-Americans will be removed from the Republican Party and damage the new orientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as immigration remains in the ramp light, Donald Trump will appear to be doing so.
Frustration over the government climbs to new peaks.
In the meantime, Donald Trump and Ben Carson disappear around half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their foreign status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new ABC/Post Monday survey, they prefer to be a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also mad at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans at the Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "suffering in Hell".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: Germany's five most exclusive residents
Here in Hobookenweg is the most expensive accommodation - overlooking the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square meter of a riding roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited," says the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows where a square meter is the most expensive in a particular location.
Of course, 18.70 Euros per square meter for a student offer in Munich are not really small.
Unlike Germany's top hotspots, however, one of the prizes is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Angel & Völkers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residences - with square meters prices in swinging heights.
There are once several tens of thousands of euros of nothing - per square meter, well-known.
But good, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is not at the top of the road.
Champions League: Bavarian Dream Start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double Torschütze in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller has just one run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller ebbed the FC Bayern the way to a earned 3:0 at Olympiako's Piraeus - then lived.
A sovereign performance of the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have protected FC Bayern in the Hexenkessel of Piraeus a dream start in the "Mission Milan".
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won her performance at the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a warm atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götzes hit (89.) worth 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th start-up success in the series is expected to be the first step towards finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where in the third run, Guardiola finally wants to get the hippo to Munich.
Müller received good support from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto at his 28th meeting in the Champions League for Bayern leadership, who had a shot of the world champion as a flag.
"We will not underestimate them," said Bayern-Captain Philipp Lahm in front of the game at Karaikakis Stadium before 31.688 hot-flowered fans - and the Munich kept the word.
They showed a concentrated and engaged view without glowing.
Piraeus had won his last six home games in the royal class, including against so-called clubs such as Manchester United, Atletique Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund was also found (1:3).
But the Bavarians, in seven European Cup dunes with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They bravely went to work, but in their offensive efforts, they often went to work in vain.
The attacks have been launched too often by game relocation on the left-hand side of Douglas Costa, who rarely went through with the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellauui.
Müller had more luck on the right than his flange from the right half-field in the upper left tower.
In the 67th minute the world champion gave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First of all, when Olympiakos stormer Ideye Brown hit Poland's headball off the line (26th).
Then by direct take, the Torwart Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians used to pull her dominant game, Piraeus was able to put needles.
But at Torhütter Manuel Neuer was released.
For example, when he shot a shot of Ideye over the latte (56).
Before Neuer, Guardiola had a four-string with David Alabama in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Gotze, after muscle problems back in the box, sat out first.
The WM-held has only given green light after the final training, sports chief Matthias Summer said at "Sky": "Who wants to do something else about it is already evil."
On the first occasion, Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the attacked Lewandowski (59.).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made it all clear 13 minutes later, one more miller was set up per eleven meters.
Before the game, it was at the stadium to crawl.
After a smaller group of partially suspected Bayern fans appeared to have provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with strikes against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was transported from the stadium.
Whoever smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Whoever smokes does not only damage the lung, but also the teeth - this puts a Potsdamer long-term study close.
The good news: If you refuse, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DifE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of premature loss of their teeth in order to increase the 2.5- to 3.6-fold.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
The main causes of tooth decay are caries and inflammations of the tooth flesh, the DifE stresses.
For these parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss therefore goes back to more frequent dental inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear how much smoking also increases the risk to careers.
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk, but within a short time, researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years until the threat again fell to the level of non-smoking, the first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham explained.
Heiner Boeing of the DifE said, "Smoking shortens life."
Not smoking is good for lungs and appliances and also leads to good dental health after our findings.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by tooth loss, the DifE reported.
Previous investigations had already pointed out that smoking increased the risk of early tooth decay.
The new long-term study undermines the findings.
Archaeologists hit Cologne Rheinifer on the remains of the latent
Archaeological findings have been made at the right Rhine-Palatinate in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German-Museum Skelette and the rest of historical buildings have dug out, said museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work at the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called soil paints.
At all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always brought up as an expert for archaeological soil care.
In the third section of the Rheinboulevard the archaeologists have now been found.
It was already known from text documents that in the 4th century there was a fortress and in the 8th century a church, explained Trier.
In addition to the rest of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 tombs was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman of Gütterzug
After a young woman at the railway station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern is disappointed, the Federal police ask the population for help.
On the morning of the morning at 1.40 p.m., the woman crossed from the direction of the railway station building coming to the end of the train station and was captured by a freighter who came from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, it has suffered the most serious injuries, according to the Federal Police.
She was treated on site in emergency care and was taken by rescue forces to a hospital.
There is no knowledge about the reason for the nightly cross-section of the young woman.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have perceived acoustic perceptions.
Inquiries come from residents or passengers from Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffartherstraße (L364).
Information provided on the cause of the accident can be provided by telephone 0800/6888000 or by any other police station at around the clock and free hotline of the Federal Police.
EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute with TTIP
To strengthen the dispute over the planned transatlantic Free Trade Agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The disputed private settlement institutions for disputes between groups and states are therefore to be resolved by a more transparent system which, in its functioning, clearly corresponds to more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said in his presentation.
Sweden intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade negotiations with the United States.
The German Government announced support.
Through TTIP, the world's largest free trade area will be created with 800 million people.
The plans for reforming the current arbitration procedures specifically provide for the EU and the US to elect jointly independent judges for a new investment court.
They are intended to form the same parts as the EU, the USA and third countries.
A second instance is provided for the first time.
She would allow it to raise objections against judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings agreed on arbitration, and there was no opposition against their judgments.
In the last month's discussion it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, it intends to work on an International Investment Court according to its own data.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be resolved there.
The investor-State partition procedures (ISDS) required by large groups in particular are considered as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional divorce courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel liturgy, by which companies are liable to cause injury to taxpayers, to impose national laws or to implement a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations, such as Campact, referred to the proposals of the EU Commission as insufficient.
It was particularly criticised that they should not apply to the already negotiated Free Trade Agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German Secretary of State Matthias Machnig (SPD) referred to the plans as major progress.
The Commission takes into account the essential points of the reform that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel has worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private divorce courts is from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European Business Europe Association warned against limiting the opportunities of the economy through too many new rules.
Especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be affected by this, it was said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) agreement can be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been in progress since mid-2013.
The topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year.
This term shall be deemed to be no longer applicable.
Delicate people of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Seventeen years ago, Sufjan Stevens sat on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him is a flip-chart on which the fearsome folk singer recorded the picturesque state of Michigan with a film pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost captured by Steven's speech.
He tells from different places that he always sign on the map, about which his minutious and sparsely arranged songs are reported.
Where they were born and what it looks like in his home.
Since then, Stevens has been a wonderful creative liar.
With the release of 2003 and the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" appeared cleverly composed songs that are very harmoniously close to the American people of the late 1960s, but at any time are able to operate in great opulence.
It creates the sound that "Michigan" would be the first part of a reference series: each of the 50 US states should be listed as follows.
However, in 2004 and near Rhine has already appeared "Seven Swans" and breaks certain expectations positively.
Reduced, Stevens comes up here.
Live enough for him guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the musician who lives in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinois"), 2005 will be a splendidly celebrated masterpiece.
Overcoming ideas and stylistic finish.
The album rises into the American billboard charts and is not missing in any year's best list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then works on "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic spare parts.
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, but it is carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and halls.
At the length of the smaller clubs, the stage shows will be presented here to the colourful spectacle of Neon star bands and large fluorescent staged cobblestones.
Now Sufjan Stevens is a part of a five-headed band through Germany.
In the dark-held Hamburger More!
He's mainly presenting the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests are now confined to their chairs, Steven's clearly matured back to intimacy and to the people.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians is playing through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you can hear: The talk is "opulent" and you can thus throw out the "plats in the bottom".
Only thanks to an addition, Stevens is modest, acoustically plays a few older songs and finally turns down under a thousand applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn Debüt has been looking forward to the Prime Minister's Question Time
The new Labour President, Jeremy Corbyn, will give his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and will first place himself with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will be raised to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance from the media likely to be examined and the Labour Representatives from nearby.
He called for "less theaters and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to their colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corby's, since it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour President to hold a memorial on Tuesday during the singing of the National Hymne to the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the centre of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corby's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention to itself.
A speaker from Mr. Corbyn said he would have "stand in respectful silence" and recognized the "heldenum of the Royal Air Force in the Air Battle around England".
But a member of Mr. Corby's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program, he had done the Labour President to sing the national hymns "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corby's top team, and they called for differences in economic, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as a leader.
The BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stamped" within Labour, according to Mr Corby's statements on the position of the European Union and the restriction on profits.
Mr Corbyn said the TUC conference that Labour has changed to remove the whole idea of a total restriction.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, shadow and rent minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26,000 £ to 23,000 £.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour President, whom David Cameron, since he is the head of Tory, is facing in the last decade via the Dispatch Box in Parliament.
The Labour President, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and was given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational and that he will be subjected to both "fighting" and the struggle with opposition and has taken place instead to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow minister of the economy, would represent him if he did not participate - for example, if Mr Cameron is on his way abroad.
He also brought the idea to the conversation that other colleagues occasionally took the word, and that he spoke to John Bercow, the speaker in the basement, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to get away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle Theatre", which is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time. But a few years later, he admitted that he had lost it.
Since she was first broadcast on television in 1990, the interview with the Prime Minister was considered as the most important barometer in the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the basement and his position among his colleagues, although critics argued that she had become a cartoonist and needed extensive reforms.
'Grosses in Joburg': Uncovered young people trained to photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a bustling place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn their livelihood.
"I what shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos from their surroundings and earn a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds increase by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
In parallel, FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, the profit and loss in the United Kingdom increased by 2.9 % over the same period of the previous year.
Since 2009, this percentage has been the fastest and delivered estimates of the time of a rise in interest.
The pound increased by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and was reduced to €1,3730 by up to 0.84 per cent against the euro.
The FTSE 100 index was increased by 1,49 % to 6,229,21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a 20 % jump after taking over the rival AB InBev offer.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the Competition Group for luxury goods.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - again reported growth.
Glencore's shares increased by 5% after the Bergbauriese said that it took $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the Mondi packaging and paper group were the biggest losses on the index, with a decrease of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had put his estimate for the company Rating on sale.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a preliminary tax result of 46.6 million for the year.
The leader of JD Sports says higher wages risked expansion.
The manager of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD sports, he added, and that could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
21-year-old lipy, a handle with over-skilly hair.
The type with the flat-blown hair is 100 million euros hard.
Even more.
Now Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going through.
Like Victoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
However, since 7:00 a.m., the police have been sitting on the cold stone plate in front of Berlin's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Square.
The Bieber-Bau: Here you live your idol, whose poster has been hanging up in Stettin since Monday night.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs just as much as her mother Ewa earns in the mid-year.
If at all.
He says, "In fact, my Victoria had to sit in the tenth grade in gymnastics."
"I fulfill her dream."
Mandatory?
Who's kidding?
The fans don't.
Not even Bieber himself.
He never made it out.
For advertising in the Superbowl’s advertising break, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti- pickle firm, many, many dollars on the beer account.
And with every doll that looks like it and over the shoplift, Bieber also cancels.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you stand on the window disc.
He's supposed to have used more than 100 million.
Some say the hype went too far.
Other emphasis, Bieber was finally in the United States and the United Kingdom with his new single "What do you mean?" on place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album should follow in November, the many zeros are not interested for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida-Plakat brings Lebaneses to the map of Kartofefladöner-idee
Cardboards or money?
It is both - and it is in the Kartofeldöner, which the Oldenburg imbessier Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the phrase "Cartofel instead of Donner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay Cartoffel and meat together have stuck to a mirror.
The idea brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Cartoffels instead of Donner", which he had seen on television at random.
Since then, in his shop there has been a barbecue with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculture for the stomach," Alhay says.
The idea has now been introduced by the Lebanese at the patent office in Munich.
It has been protected, according to the Authority's information, since recently as a pattern of use.
So how much meat and how much potatoes the spirit contains, Alhay doesn't want to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
Also with its customers, the culinary understanding of the peoples is good.
Metcash launches soil resistance campaign to fight Aldi incident
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a soil resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through Mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as through events as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as icemaker Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes samples in IGA stores and shop owners, the registered tickets for the South Australian football game to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler conducts his annual investor strategy day for food, alcohol and equipment.
There is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA charging business and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the East States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have notorious provincial and IGA retailers with a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the East.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will be removed from the market about five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first market, and all existing actors will be removed but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash about $13 million in advance of interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the eastern states, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most reliable.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's revenue in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business in Melbourne that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to react publicly to Mr Douglas' comments.
But it is expected that a board member from Metcash has contacted Mr Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenues from Metcash's food and food trade, which has been supplied by some 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction at the same time pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million to compare sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by improving fast-growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods.
Metcash's chief businessman, Ian Morrise, says that the price adjustments and charging tariffs will be applied to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian tennis club Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his conduct.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves, in the view of the president of the Australian tennis club Steve Healy rather praise as a critic for his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", is led by Kyrgyz's announced clash with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters' Rampenenlicht.
In a fiery skill game in Cincinnati shortly thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the judge, with Harrison saying, "Wawrinka should have struck Kyrgyz, and I should have struck the child."
While he was last seen crashing a tennis player after a crash defeated a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was constantly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for the second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup semifinal against the UK.
"One thing that I'm far more concerned about is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi was a little in dispute," Healy said.
He broke a blower when he lost in the US open due to a crash, but he is not the first player to break a blower out of frost with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US openings, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much recognition.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the dressing area, he's trained hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and exhausting young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgyos in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right decision for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return as a long-term fixed component to the team."
"First, we wish that the team is fully focused on competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick has succeeded very quickly in raising people like Feder and Murray. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time outside of the ramp light, in which he can only think about it, I consider it appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and set off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to get illegally into the country. All with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a non-Serb country and responded with enthusiasm.
The people who were fleeing from violence stood in an unknown time on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and lay down there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police conscripter swung over them, the migrants ran "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian emergency police.
Some show off from protest food and water back.
Serbia's Foreign Minister stated that it was "unacceptable", that migrants would be sent back from Hungary, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border was unable to agree on a common immigration policy one day after the 28-nation bloc in Brussels at a meeting.
However, the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overcrowded Italy and Greece, and they expressed their hope that, at the end of the month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would take up another 120,000 refugees, including some of them from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.
However, Hungary did not place its hopes on an immediate action by Brussels or its neighbours.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation in two southern regions gave the authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so that they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also plans to build a stone-haired son along his border to Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it had ended a Zaun on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison cases were used in the race to create the Stacheldraht Zaun between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major hub for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, and has become the starting point for the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the emerging economic refugees who are looking for a better life are not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force around midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4-metre (13 feet) high fence, which the government has allowed to build along the southern border to Serbia to be a crime. These laws also impose higher prison sentences for convicted human dealers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of the emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters of Associated Press have seen heavy-armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for a long time.
Gyorgy Bacondi, National Security Council for Orban, said that 45 authorities had already entered the country more deeply when attempting to cross the border.
They come over by harming the zoo, they are now in police custody, and they are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are about to repair the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, two of the seven border crossings with Serbia were also concluded by Hungarian officials after a train ride with Stacheldraht to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data from people and pressured a crowd to enter there.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead in front of Bernie Sanders in national survey
Former U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to have a two-way lead in the democratic race to nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her against the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 per cent of the democratic voters in the elections (58 per cent before), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 per cent (up 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidency, is receiving 15 per cent of the democratic voters of the elections.
More than five months before the beginning of the elections, most democratic voters say it's too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more persistent in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS-News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has achieved some gains.
Clinton has a great advantage in women and men, but these advantages have decreased.
Their support for men is clearly weak, and Sanders is only back here with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters under 50 has flown, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage in the older voters.
In the past month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with a two-way lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the national elections say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if he was nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support them.
Perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are particularly excited about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them with enthusiasm.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters of the elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Approval for dealing with the problems and eligibility is also quoted.
Since the Vice-President is throwing a potential for the President's office into the scales, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not.
If democratic voters of the elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
The Clinton supporters say more than half that Biden would be their second choice far from Sanders.
If Biden decides not to apply for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's preference for sanders is increased, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him running.
Fifty percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this figure has decreased by 78 percent in the last month.
Biden is a second in this measurement at a distance, but the percentage that sees him as the "chosenest" has increased.
Nevertheless, in the question of what is more important to a candidate, democratic voters call questions about selectivity.
Like in the last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the elections is as unacceptable as possible.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features in choosing their party's choice.
Most people view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
The three candidates are best cut off by honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, so many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not think of him.
Democratic voters of the elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are still being asked during the term of office as a foreign minister, most democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions in general.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion about this was split in March shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on their general views of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsened.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered to be honest and confidential by the voters of its party, this remains a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see them as honest and confidential, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of the electors do not consider them to be honest and confidential.
At the same time, 55 per cent of the electors of the country also view Trump as not honest and not confidential.
However, Clinton and Trump receive good grades in leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush cut off the best in honesty.
A majority sees Sanders more than honest, but like Carson, many don't think of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson comes up at a countrywide survey near Donald Trump
Ben Carson is at the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates are currently missing half of the voter support in the new survey, and others lose dramatically in detention.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers throughout the country. Support increases by 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson dropped from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is good at demographic groups and exceeds Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been struck with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, which is the bottom line, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are 6% in the third place.
The error margin in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson is increasing in the survey - it has 19% support for Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The latest survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly in front of Carson.
With a view to a carson rising last week, Trump found some sideways for the former neurosurgeons, even after Carson apologized for asking Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Enjoyable bath temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm to 29 degrees.
Even if peaks are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is already enough for bathing holidayers to find warm water.
A bath in the North or East Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer go to the sea: Maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and East Sea this week, shares the German Weather Service (DWD).
On the other hand, bath temperatures offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic, there are 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees away.
Five members of the brotherhood with the death of a Baruch College-Neuling
Almost two years after a student died during a skikanous ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, death, murder charges against five people are filed.
Members of the New Yorker Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi-Britderschaft attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 brutally and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police reported.
Officials said he was loaded with attached eyes with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked while he was trying to go over a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, and then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after the sound was out of power and apparently waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, so the police said.
But they had the time to change Deng's clothes, to gloat his symptoms, and to contact Andy Meng's national presidents to get advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide tools and put the welfare of the brotherhood basically over that of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.
He couldn't be rebuffed, and he died in his injuries the next morning.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added to the head, shoulder and upper neck with strong force.
"Many families were destroyed by the Shikans of the brotherhood. At least one student has died to the Shikans since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Dengs family, in a statement.
Brothers and their members must be taken into account, and this step by the authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third degree murder charge for the first five members.
Two-thirds of the members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also accused of skilful attacks and the formation of a criminal union.
"We do not only want to make the parties responsible, but if there is an organization that - officially or informally - has sanctioned this, we will also take them into account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases the interest
There is a rise in interest rates, and the house will be turned into a square, income will be increased for loans, and the economy will be brought into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it all takes and how long it's gonna take.
In particular, the history of the economy provides only a small guide to the end.
A recession came within 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, although not always, a factor in how the economy and financial institutions react.
Therefore, representatives of the US central bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on raising interest rates when they start, but rather on the time needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end, however, market participants could conclude that all the excitement may have been exaggerated due to a rise in interest rates.
"The first increase in Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "big money", said Julian Jessop, the chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still to a low level to lead to seismic shock, which many seem to be afraid of.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effect.
Here is a historical trend based on how some areas of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen in the last month, the advance of interest increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for assets to be rejected 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," said Deutsche-Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in the fed.
More precisely, the market is mostly in the upward trend over the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest growth, rather flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal state after 500 days, with an average yield in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, Head of Installation Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the income starts to decrease.
Reactions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist in the past and that could accelerate a recession.
It is particularly noteworthy that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at an increase in the interest of the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, at the 118 interest increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to take place and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta Fed.
Increases in interest rates at such a fragile economic level could be risky and raise the question of whether this time is different," the Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been looking all year round at an increase in interest rates of the Fed, and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many streets and economies believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the future trade only suggests a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all the growth cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre-recession heights have been put in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery," the report said.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is at a distance of the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are up to 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market is expected to increase interest, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on loans is faster than on shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of loans, the income appears to change the direction as soon as the first increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the borrowers fell immediately, the Deutsche Bank said.
The streets of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer collection of income between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a deflation of the curve.
High-level loans often produce better returns in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of more stringent monetary policies," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is smoother, credit chains have expanded and volatility has increased - all features of the market if the Fed strengthens its strategy.
In large and in whole companies that deal with most of their business in the United States will benefit from increasing interest rates and attracting local products.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debts.
"The story shows that "quality" shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial increase in interest," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer report.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have over 5 percentage points on average over companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their pendant with low quality on average 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debts are going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most," Goldman said.
Outside of the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savings could see gains through higher earnings, even if experts of different opinions are how quickly this will take place.

He argues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits
The Voice was attacked by Parliament's colleague Damien Collins and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims to be a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the sender to prove that he is doing something that the private senders do not do.
Conservative Senator Andrew Bingham also told the BBC boss that the public-law radio broadcaster was "damaged" and that it was increasingly no different from his commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dumping" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards that started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, appear to be only under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else - these are two examples called spontaneous, where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC Director-General recalled the proposals and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public disclosure.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm going to learn about classical music nowhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to commission new works, I'm also really important," he said.
At the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that it had to be worked harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not, however, the only element of BBC production which, during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, led to the introduction of commercial rivals to the feet.
The Tory Deputy Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of £22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly significant?
Lord Hall stated that the BBC 1-show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "on a special BBC fashion".
He added that he wished the company to find "a hit from our own home stable" when it next started a series of entertainment.
However, he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to issue the fees paid by the taxpayer for other forms of entertainment.
Internet exchanges are the slowest in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the censuses in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using phones for sale
Experts believe that the Black Friday has stopped spending in November
For over a decade, virtual purchases have been booming, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have become ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that the online setups stagnate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the censuses in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales stagnate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back until 2000, then this has always evolved over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started to shop with their phones.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now this is happening, and we may experience that growth decreases.
The Black Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as a reason for the subsequent sales.
Experts believe that buyers keep their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers cut off their computer to make their wallets, and some dealers' websites broke down.
Experts believe that Black Friday, on which the buyers fought for shorts, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study of the British Retail Consortium found that a little more than £5 was spent online.
In some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made via Web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashionnets in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca during the Cran accident - Bin Laden's family is being punished
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partially puts the collapse of the huge Saudi bin-load group to the load
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crash
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed on Mecca's Great Mosque.
Regrettably full, largely dressed in white, the route to pay their respects when the first of the dead entered their last trip to the Al-Moaisem-Freedhof.
The mourning process took place at the Holy Place, where only days earlier a boulder through the roof of the mosque and then collapsed on the prayings.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a penalty on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 men who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Moschee Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Great Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly promised that the haddsch will move to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have left the crane's arm when it was not used.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin-Load Group was responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's leadership was prohibited from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the storm of the crane to collapse in an inner courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before Haddsch, who later took place in this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not issue any statements on the collapse of the Crans, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also divided the group because of non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Hundreds of cranes surrounded by Mikkas Großmoschee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi family for decades and has been undertaking larger construction projects.
The dead leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a distraught son who was adopted by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse of the crane came in the middle of strong winds and rains, just a few days before millions of people in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is needed at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (£ 174,000) be paid to the relatives of the victims and the same amount of permanent injuries.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European artisans is over
Britain increasingly employs handicrafts, says Veronica Laury
The number of skilled artisans from Eastern Europe has risen behind it
This leads to the opening of 200 additional screwfix loads aimed at crafts.
At the same time, Kingfisher 60 B&Q sales outlets will close the countrywide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britain lowers its barriers and brush in favour of the use of skilled East European handicrafts who carry out their work at home
If you can walk around with a hammer or a brush to stretch the walls, you are now apparently one of a minority.
Because Britain is increasingly employed by handicrafts to carry out homework in their homes, the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled artisans from Eastern Europe who currently offer services at low prices has been overwhelming.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops that are directed to handicrafts and close 60 sales stations of B&Q.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight of ten purchase decisions in the shop are made by women.
At the moment, the men are superior to the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that are making more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "There is still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to shift this to a greater balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of products by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laury, who is one of only five leading companies at the top of a British FTSE100 index, has also transformed her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial management.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in the half-year’s earnings and sales after the group buried the costs for closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingsfisher, the screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich/Dob because of mistrust in court
At the Landesgericht Klagenfurt, on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vizemeister Aich/Dob have to be responsible for mistrust and tax evasion.
The defendants are not guilty.
One of them was also accused of abuse.
From this proposal, he was legally acquitted in May.
The current process has been lost.
According to Colonel Robert Riffel, in the pre-trial investigation, the defendants had been using funds from associations that they could have made available for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
The damage is about 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also accused of financial failure.
This fact was distinguished by the president of the creation Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
In view of the rejection of the mistrust, the defence stated that at no time did the association have a share of assets.
The sports officials had only calculated expenses and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money out of debt - the liability amounted to around 600,000 shillings in 2001 (EUR 44,000).
"At that time we were facing the situation: Do we lead the club further or do we stop?" said one of the defendants, in the brothel of the financial firm.
With his colleague and colleague, he then decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We have set up money, placed our life insurance as security at the bank," he said at the adoption.
The association has been agreed: you can freely manage the money, it must not be done in any way.
In addition - in the case of the corresponding financial - success has been decided on the payment of the damage caused by the damage caused by the damage caused by the damage caused by the damage caused by the damage caused by the damage caused by the damage caused by the damage caused by the damage caused by the damage caused by the damage caused by the damage caused by the damage caused by the damage caused by the damage caused by the accident.
Therefore, a part of the damage caused by the damage was paid only years later, that is, from 2003, when a plus was on the account.
Therefore, neither pauschal nor detailed readings appeared, the former Obmann explained the proceedings.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payments were not made to the association in detail.
The association has not been interested in the details of the financial situation, it is important that only the debt-freeness has been the answer.
When a formal investigation was initiated in 2011, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account.
The defendants explained that it was a setback.
This security account came under the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association according to his statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The question was not answered for a long time.
He finally thought that this was the best thing for the association.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The co-rapporteur was informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "recovery".
Why do you want to know about damages?, the judge and the lawyer wanted to know.
The first defendant then declared that he had not agreed with this wording because the association had never been damaged.
But what am I supposed to do when the lawyer says, "With this you're all from the cuter."
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never made a cent worth, he calculated only kilometer money and diets.
He has taken into account the company of 1,000 euros per month, but the actual effort has been much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide detailed documentation for the previous years.
These were no longer stored after an operating test in which everything was properly assessed, they explained.
The second defendant had also been in charge of kilometre money.
All the corrections were made in the bar, so he had to drive from his place of residence to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main debate will continue on 23 September with the question of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard extends another 30,000 jobs
In addition, for the three years that have been in progress, the computer crisis will reduce further jobs in the company's fragmentation.
No end can be found for the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP).
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to cut down from 25,000 to 30,000 seats in its company customer.
As a result, costs of $2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion) were to be saved, the company informed on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special load of about 2.7 billion dollars, which will fall from the fourth quarter.
The three-year reduction of 55,000 jobs has not yet been completed.
By the end of the financial year 2013/14, HP employed about 302,000 employees.
After all, the Hewlett packaged stock was 2.3 percent.
The group from the California-based Palo Alto is currently divided into groups: This is how the computer and printer business is to be merged into a new company today - separated from the more challenging areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both business parts are to be listed at the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC charge and a weaker demand for business customers for its services recently put the world's second-largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo.
In the third business quarter at the end of July, the paragraph of PC and printers returned by 11.5 percent.
The turnover fell by 8 percent to nearly $25.4 billion.
This led to the recovery in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a break-up and massive job strikes on the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only recently responded to the fact that customers strengthen smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online at the same time.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide for the total reduction of around 55,000 posts.
Conflicts: Most support the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would largely turn to rejection: 54 per cent spoke against, 35 per cent agreed.
The fact that other States are flying against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
24% are in conflict.
A collaboration with the Syrian ruler Baschar al-Assad denied 51 per cent of the respondents, 20 per cent for that.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: Second press day on the 66th IAA
The center of the fair is connected to the 27th September, self-driving cars as well as the electricity mobility.
After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show under the motto "Connects Mobility" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA of Saturday.
The organizers of the VDA Auto Association count as two years ago with about 900,000 visitors.
Röszke: violence broke out on the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used on the Serbian border at Röszke Tränengas and water wells against several hundred displaced refugees.
Euronews correspondent Daniel Bozsik has experienced the violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
After that, a police station was formed and behind the police station, a water heater was set up.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles after the officers.
The officers first introduced uninterrupted pepper spray.
Then the police used Trengengas.
A lot of gas has been sprayed towards the refugees.
This led to the dissolution of the group.
The refugees have now retreated a little.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone.
Children who had blown the train gas scream.
Other refugees fell together and were left under breath.
The Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of Trengen gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Bank
The world observes when the US notary bank meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not the interest will be increased for the first time for almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half the last week of the view was that the Fed would do this, now thinks that the Fed will continue a little longer and the interest rates will be maintained at the current rate of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been here seven years since the Fed interest was put on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Head of Staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good level of performance, billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
She warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs indicated that the chances of such a move are good.
Decision to be notified at 20 a.m. on Thursday
Death benefits at Delta State University leave an apology
After shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that it was "pain killing" at the first murder and wanted to make it invisible," authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, requested the emergency number at 10:00 on Monday morning
And said, "He shot someone and killed someone."
Lamb told the staff at the emergency station that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" was in the house, but "no one will disturb", but he'll probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it to him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, who said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening, when the police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, which the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "dreeding relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they had been married for about seven years as a "good man".
Both were separated 15 years ago, but friends remained.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19 and she was "destructed on the ground".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prettiss, who had a dog called Lightning, had met Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "He's not going to prison."
When the police took him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, ran on foot, walked into the woods and killed himself with a gun.
Lamb received a doctoral title from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as stated on the University's website.
Stars who lost their lucky bears
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor also reportedly has to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted for possession of drugs.
I'm sure that's what he's asking for.
Eurowings: Lufthansa built the group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group building.
One half billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save itself with a better organisation.
150 of the world's 1000 leading forces will cost the group building the workplace.
With the pilot trade union, there are new negotiations.
Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and is worth the price of the Eurowings.
The objective of the re-establishment was to provide a profit of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and recovery synergies, and the airline shared on Wednesday.
In the future, among other things, there will be no board for the passenger business in Lufthansa.
The Eurowings cheap flights should be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings.
The re-establishment underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to take action against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of 120,000 employees was a complex of strong companies.
The airlines signed under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations will be resumed on Thursday after the trial strike.
That's what the union shared.
The topic of the talks should be the rest of the room for pilots.
Cockpit wants to come "in a year with a forecasted record result" as quickly as possible to deliver results.
The conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision of the pilots, the concept of "Wings" is the background.
It is expected that Lufthansa, in the fight against competitors, will strike off the Group's Eurowings bill.

Luke Shaw by Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw, at the Champions League level of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven, suffered a double fracture of his right leg.
While this brought the left foreign defender to the wine and will be excluded for at least six months from the game, Louis van Gaal does not hope that Shaw can play again in this season.
The injury was caused by a careless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw was broken into the PSV area.
He was treated in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operating in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, it's very hard and then plays fantastically, and then it happens.
He had an oxygen mask in the dressing room.
It's hurt.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to be a red card and the hanging of an eleven meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the judge, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian judge was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an eleven meter and a red card were missing.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my way to recovery now, I come back stronger."
To this end: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat of the PSV
The British defender, with the European Championship in France, has an additional incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this kind of injury leaves the place, all are very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a bone fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland's team at the WM 2014.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and then when you hear that it's a very bad injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction, so it looked like he [moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In the conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard this can be.
I feel really bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a game by Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
It's a thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't take long until you know it almost externally.
You know, maybe you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite childbook, the Minister for The Lorax, the environmental fabel of Dr. Seuss, appeared in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "sudden, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book that I like to read to my children, because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we've missed so far."
Everything is nice and good, except that the next paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the book's action, reflects a content of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text.
"In the middle of the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a young man named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by seeing her desire to see a real tree," one read. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose true name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if this would not be suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and begins: "In the walled town of Thnead-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a young man named Ted, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the book. Here is an unnamed boy, like the local environment through the money-bearing, fallen trees, thorn-striking once-in-a-half despite the protests of the so-called Lorax, a horrifying, snow-beared being who speaks "in the name of the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively low PR assignment was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in advance of a child.
A Downing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
To hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the box that England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series is not on my map.
I would not exclude an external victory.
Alastair Cooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the Batting setting, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars from 2012, only a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size on the test level, it is an option for the attack.
Here's a message: Adam Lyth separates from the England-Test Framework and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to release Adam Lyth, of course, is hard to analyze for me as his chief coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no questionnaires at Joe Root, for example, and this led to the nomination, because - and I have said this before - players are their own best voters.
Long ago, Lyth's course had been extended, but he had control over his own fate.
If he hopefully puts out further runs for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The English coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not do so well, and that does not surprise me; he is a team-man in particular.
The question of how long a test slagman gets to put his signs is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only suggestion that can be raised was that England first put Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's a hit man I appreciate very much.
He's an X-factor cricket player, what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge spot, which hit us very hard.
At least he must be given the same opportunities as before him, but this of course depends on the team formation in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to let Moeen beat up next to Cook, which would give an extra spin-bowler and get four quicks, turned up, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a hit man can't hit there, and this left hand has already shown that he's a hell of a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He got three hundred runnings right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the cage as a back-up spinner, and in my limited treatment with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at their statistics - on average 31 with the ball and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there are no large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have decided for young people.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some clever additions to the training staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman of Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a lot of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or coach, and how Mahela has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing room, even if the messages are consistent with the previous sentence.
Collys teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayers, Root has been given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and teambuilders do not determine the timetable.
And you have to think that, like players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made in the light of hearts.
Brexit stock (Brexit = United Kingdom's exit from the EU) could win at Zulup if the economy turned into a liquid by 2017
David Cameron's undeclared new negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is becoming more difficult every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is strongly opposed to Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend recently said that some Member States, as deep as the EU is now and not always because of their own debt, have set up an agenda with split concessions and disruptive treaty changes, which they do not usually want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it should not be allowed even if they were in danger of social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win alliances for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants to see Britain in the EU's internal goal - "Let's not only with France," says Berlin - and let's see that more and more short-term ministers and officials have arrived in some major cities to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
German-owned Chancellor Angela Merkel is an associate, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office, before it looks bad for her, as it has happened in the overcrowded exiles such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande is looking at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He's also a blasphemous force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain will have a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will be stretched out a leg to help the selfie-britches, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's withdrawal from the UK - something they do not want, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, perhaps some such ministers are planning even deliberately not helpful remarks, quite in the SNP style, while Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspected.
"The renegotiation was a plea" and "United Kingdom has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how devastating the Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU skeptics are the oligararchy of the press barone, as they were during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can think of Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro Opportunists, who made a name as a "EU-Garde-Banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of Tax-fearing Skurks, Telephone-Hacking Foreigners and the Pseudo Non-Inlanders, who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair thought similar about her, but found that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you distribute better bananas to get rid of it, instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum, because Blair had laid down the principle of the unadopted EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never did that to him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly tap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he didn't need any more time to waste on me - seems at risk to repeat the strategy of Neil Kinnock Boycott Murdoch of the 1980s, a mistake then and today.
It can take a while, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corby's official position on Europe - I sometimes express it in kind - is in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue color tandem and the wildest fields of Torys Small-Englandism can probably say yes to that.
It is what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and television this week when the roadfinder fought in him, not to say that Corby's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried to be unfairly on TV to his employees, without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "under all circumstances" - Ben's expression - was not what McDonnell said, but what JC told his fellows and deputies after all the reports at their closing meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the touching bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he has even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the street of the social media, a crime scene of Paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to hold Labour's support in the referendum campaign for self-intelligibleness, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corby's fundamental multidemonstration of EU membership - in line with its Benite settlement economy, its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of the left-wing esoteric debate, for which the narcism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its multiplicity to Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that JC does not start a campaign to get out - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of homelessness for their clients.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, - they also have mysterious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be meaningless?
The United States has already been rather disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction in the cost of the Tory government in power, where I was reminded of something called the British Influence Security Forum at the beginning of Monday.
Experts criticise Report of Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking were created by a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed to criticize the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "baseline report" last month and described it as a "extensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A reference in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely guilty basis" on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two further researchers wrote in BMJ and asked whether the claims "to build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were invited to develop a model for a multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to bring their opinions on the damages of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose manager had previously received British American Tobacco Medium (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding that he was supposed to receive from the tobacco company Philip Morris International according to reports.
The reasons for the selection of members of the board are not provided, but several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate a sector financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this session are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also took part in the tobacco management of PHE.
The research work of the group "remarkably", that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products at most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, no such links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers were delayed".
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded to.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifetime smoker dies in his search.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to this, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it does not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die of a smoking-related illness each year, and smoking costs the National Health System two billion £ per year.
The clear presentation of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastAnders, former head of Channel 4 says
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastAnders and The Voice. He said commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transmitters.
He criticised the BBC for placing public-law programs that are probably seen by a smaller audience in strongly controversial windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and from senders such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have had problems with the idea that BBC programs are in charge or are sending, which would also clearly be shown by non-subsidized rivals," Johnson told the Oberhaus Communications Committee as part of his research on the future of the BBC.
If you would like to keep the radio fee, which I do not consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least have its production on programs that others do not do or order.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to reach as wide support as possible for their future.
The idea that anyone else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax program is funded, which could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastAnders is another, given to both own productions.
Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public-law television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was responsible for hunting for evaluations "because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts return to what former director of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like EastAnders should be sold.
Johnson said that the rather public-legal NIS programmes should "go to BBC4, where you can hardly measure the audience, but they fulfill their tasks, and they can argue when they go on their seeming missions to justify 4 billion pounds of radio charges, "Now, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen."
They put them in a time window where no one wanted to see them.
For the radio fee, Johnson said to the Committee: "I ask you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from it.
Of course you all think, we all think you get a great value here for 150 £ per year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £, ask me if that's right, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also spoke before the Committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC examine their Reithian mission "to inform, form and entertain".
He said that only a few of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% of its radio production - and that it should be an example for public television broadcasters in Australia and Canada to change this in "informed, informed and entertaining".
On the issue of the partnerships Elstein said that BBC should do more in areas like the proms, of which he said that only a handful will be shown on TV, and enter alliances with the commercial envoys to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction in the moment they are powered by sound impulses.
Scientists have raised worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The small nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are exposed to sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by activating motoreuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Further on this topic: Researchers read and write hygiene with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new process, called Sonogenetics, when ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fadenwarmers usually do not react to ultrasonic noise, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by fluids with microscopic air bubbles.
The blasts, he found out, reinforce the ultrasonic waves that then enter the worms.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the heat cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to, such a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasonic controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of its motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When applying ultrasonic to the modified creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microbulbs and transferred to the worms where they include the modified motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optics, a decommissioning tool, which allows the scientist to switch on and off neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light, which must be sent to the desired place in the brain at an optical fiber, low frequency ultrasonic tissue may pass unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the shoulder.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to temporarily make the target human neurons susceptible to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Displaying United Kingdom’s arms trade
See Amnesty International Anti-Weapon fair video.
Terrible killer drones!
Stylish legs! Stylish legs!
Streuben!
And electroshocks that cause painful pain, but don't leave any trace!
The joyful voice and the Cartoon images no doubt that this display for the world's largest gun fair is a battle parody produced by Amnesty International to bring the British government's readiness to bring to light the ramp, weapons to repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible on bus stops and in the subway trains and require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive with the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the fonts of the London Underground and the marks of the DLR line, which turns into a panzer image.
In September a swarm of arms dealers will drive with the DLR ... customers will be asked to help at the stop of the gun fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have shown their work in the Museum for Gray Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped with distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 £ package of inbus keys, which claims to "access to around a third of the bus stop advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this poster "Vandaism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and Professor at the University of Essex, artists will be critical and try to bring political works to the public outside galleries.
Many artists work with activists in protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-war trading venues welcomes the pendants in the U-Bahn.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the VCCP advertising agency, who works in a non-profit with the graphic and voiceover artist who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Liver was amazed at the silence that ruled around the advertising for the weapons fair - through an empty site of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic multifaceted company, but "through the incorporation with bright colors and animation it remains more binding."
"They've done a fantastic job helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an entry of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not unlawfully dealt with at our door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the gun fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors make fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release Saab reveals an order from the US army about "the AT4CS RS shot off by the shoulder."
This includes "a uniquely formed fighting head that delivers outstanding side effects within the target."

Eight Golden Rules for Life in Student Housing Homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-reminded 19-year-old, I moved to a student's home, still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smiles of those I've offended - and the numerous long-standing complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entrance to student residences is quite alarming from mild to absolute.
It's tempting to say: tell people where you come from, whether or not you took a Saturday year, where you are in relation to Corbyn, and why you "honestly Marmite doesn't love or hate, because seriously, guys, it's just a haHAHA extract, I'm in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It attracts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your fire extinguishers were in fire and these fire extinguishers were.
Let people go.
The rooms of people often turn into drinks receptions, movie night venues and municipal meeting points, but they are also the places where people draw and recycle their underwear.
To this end: Do not think about starting at the Uni with a relationship
Introverted people get a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refugee, but many students' homes form a space-to-space boom culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
That could be hell for someone who tries to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away, so that I get the energy I've spent on interacting with you."
Try to feel when a Commilion of Society is exhausted - and send him a text message instead.
Approach: Do it.
A guy in my student residence had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship through the trunks.
Since you start the Uni at the top of the back manie, the knock at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the greeting of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have baked you something. So, and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade candy is a good way to close friendships.
Your people feel obliged to entertain themselves, and at the end your face may be associated with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you're a decent baker.
Bad mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when you hit.
Stealing food is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, the cloning of chickens is a theft, but is the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves even if they cook inside.
When someone steals your things, it's angry, and you have my compassion - but try to treat me more balanced than my companion, who added to her milk a dish to punish the disease.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make a noise that keeps people from sleeping or from work.
It is not just about being a decent person, but about being one of the people who sit in the glasshouse in the true sense of the word.
A girl on my flair asked her neighbors if it would make them feel a little bit more quiet, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5: 00 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two hours before she gave up her own music, closed her door and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future mate would happen to enter the same student's home?
On the other hand, would it not be extremely painful if you kept a companion for your future mate, ransacked them, separated them, and then had to see them every day and perhaps live to see them pass over to each other?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a warm companion is definitely not your future mate, at least try to instill a little sense of understanding in your offspring.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unclosed room, the boundary between a wolf and mobbing is finer than it seems.
A good strike is fun, but it only takes moments until it gets to the boomerang.
Share a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding - but never waste anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock her door, and put her keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but thank you for your properties on the deck no more than twice.
Series homes for refugees, self-employed, low-cost workers
The real estate company Markus Gildner builds in the medieval corner houses for people who do not have much money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the only raising mother and the slave."
"I show how you can still build cheap and well today," says 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will be forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur, Markus Gildner, believes it is possible to create a fast-changing living room: he builds in a project series houses for refugees.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will be forced into the housing market.
What is your solution?
Markus Gildner: Massive accommodation in containers or tournaments has no sustainability.
Because people stay a large part here.
In view of the flow of refugees, we also need adequate living space in the next decades.
A completely banal, three - story house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs at least one place.
It facilitates integration.
It's different when you put people in housing blocks.
Each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each of four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living area per house is 184,000 euros, without land.
That's surprising.
Six months the construction took place.
That's appropriate.
Did the construction regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I have successfully completed my project.
Especially complicated, it always makes the threatening Damocle black special construction and the local regulations.
Terrible.
It is still submitted that whoever creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three seats.
Only in the cities there is no room for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents respond to their serial home project?
Gildner: There were those who proposed to me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What's definitely not right.
But don't you enhance the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: It is true: In the last five years, we had a construction tree in Germany, but luxury apartments were built that can hardly afford one more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need a living room.
Not only refugees, but also the only raising mother or the slave.
I show you how you can still build well today.
That's why.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first worked with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, typing "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If it is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have been hit by problems after installing, as they receive an error message that tells you the "software update failed" has failed.
In order to deal with the problem, users are advised to wait either until the storm returns or tries to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely by shrinking the update. Also, it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is up to date or is in the vicinity of a charger so that the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off half way and this could lead to an interruption of the update.

Rosberg's only currency: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows about the WM title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton just another currency: "Full Attack".
The WM's second emphasis before the start was on the decision-making seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose anymore".
53 points separate the world champion before the night break in Singapore on this Sunday by title defenders and double champion Hamilton.
Britain has already won seven of the previous 12 seasons and takes the river-light Grand Prix in the city as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Brit could win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city will have the biggest price of Singapore influence is still unclear.
For days a shower bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club, founded three months ago, "Schachfriend Bad Kissingen" has taken up another member in its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is a carrier of the 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation that the president, Alfred Klein, rejected.
It is possible to include chess players who cannot make the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent research should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership of the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club "Rot-White" will be seen as an expression of its relationship with the Kurstadt.
Quarter office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the old center Antonistift have joined under the mantle of the Social Foundation and opened a new station at the Graf-Stauffenberg Square.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The Social Foundation takes it from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, the Count Stauffenberg Square.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, in addition to the shopping market, seniors and consultants immediately receive information on issues such as care insurance or the services of hospitals and hospitals.
For years, we have established with our ambulance that caregivers are often left alone.
There are endlessly many questions.
"Neither are many of the services of the cashiers rarely taken into account because the complexity of the insurance is not yet understood," explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the citizen hospital as well as for the ambulance service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
To this end, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as storm prevention, memory training or physical therapy can be used.
The offers from the Senior Centre and Saludi are complemented in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, precautions and reha.
"The Senior Care and Care Centre," wrote Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new headquarters office in the city center is that both managers are particularly involved in demographic change.
Because this makes good decentralized infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future essential.
In addition, according to Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) at the celebrations of dedication, the Quartet Office also devotes itself to the assembly at the age of: "There are numerous events and offers on the program, and they invite you to a regular social meeting".
This enabled the Social Foundation to make a big contribution to the ability of seniors to live as independently and well as possible in their trusted environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Entracht Bamberg v. Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it's official: After the repair work at the Fuchsparkstadion of the appointment for the game FC Entracht Bamberg has not yet been determined against the third-legislators Würzburger Kickers, it has now been set as the appointment on 6 October.
The meeting of the FC Entrracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian football totopokals against the third-party FC Würzburger Kickers has now been completed.
It is played on Tuesday, October 6, at 7pm at Bumberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are happy to know now that when the game is over the stage, we now have planning security," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the sale of cards now launched.
It is especially for our team to play against a third party.
We therefore look forward to numerous viewers, and this is not without reason, because fluctuations have a special rise.
In the course of the last 16 teams, the FC Entracht Bamberg 2010 won the District List 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and home against the Regional Lists 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Association 2016/2017.
The third-party defender is SpVgg Unterhaching.
Wiener Architect Karl Mang died 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5, at the age of 92, as the artist's house reported on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the broadcast.
Born in 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and institute manager.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Forming.
In the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the treasure chamber in Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lobkowitz in the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Park Penalty: Tim Weise is a cash cop.
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese is in Bremen.
The footballer was once, in the meantime Tim Wiese, former national guardians in Germany and at Bremen and Hoppenheim, Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass, according to his own statement in the past two years.
On the other hand, he didn't give up intellectually.
Wiese had just cut his hair in the Bremer Inn, when he saw a parking guard outside exhibiting a criminal record for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then came out of the shop, attacked the officer and threw the falsified money penalty at her feet, as the "image" section reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the predictions, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual event.
"The thing is still in the test," says the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether or not to show grass.
The authorities of Panama destroy 4500 Marihuana plants
The fertile soil and the rain forest-type climate of the Isla del Rey are best suited for the cultivation of Marihuana plants.
For three days, the authorities have driven out the 4,500 plants and burned them.
Men spread to 17-year-old Afghans
Witnessing is looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmunster: On Friday evening, at 23.45 a.m., three young men were on their way from Bad Soden to Salmunster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghane, followed his two friends in a distance of about five metres, according to the police, and asked them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft tank.
Three persons were also present on the site of the tank.
One of these men now screamed at the young man and struck him in the face with the fist.
The victim suffered a nose fracture and bleeds heavily from the nose.
When his two friends huddled up and spoke heavily on the battlefield, he first left his victim.
His friends brought the injured young man home now.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a pkw up to their apartment and went there demonstrably several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured went before the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the fighter and another male person.
With the aid of a blowstock, the victim's face and upper neck were struck.
The victim had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the offender.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters.
The second blower was supposed to be about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and notifiers to report under phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euro
Silvia Müller-Gongol and Frank Müller (left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
In addition, the mayor of the municipality, Bernd Bormann, the economist, Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorfs, the mayor of Heinfried Kabbert, are also pleased.
In many places in the country, no doctors - Asenddorf has luck: Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is in rest, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, is still on the side of his successor in the next few months.
After a conversion phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until that time he invested EUR 310000 in the spaces at St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was at the first glance when the Felstehausen met Frank Müller and his wife, Silvia Müller-Goll, who are currently completing their professional training in the World Hospital and will also want to enter the practice next year.
"We always had in our backyard that the millers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was so, I just called her."
The couple Müller liked the idea of carrying out their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years."
As an advantage he also sees being his own boss soon.
And so you agreed, the millers bought the house with the practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the father of two families Frank Müller has also grown up, his medical study in Hanover in several medical practices, as well as in hospitals in Sullingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as an operator in Sullingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as the leading notarist in the Diepholz district and is honorably engaged in the DRC-Friendship Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From September 19th, the practice is being prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a house doctor, his Gattin Ursel (Internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both Internistists, want to go down as home physicians.
"The endoscopy therefore comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongol.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic investigations as well as long-term and load-EKGs and need a more speech room.
In addition, the EDV is completely renewed.
A total of EUR 50000 is awarded to the millers in the framework of a programme of support from the district (EUR 25000) and from the municipality of the municipality (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will be carried on," said Mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongol, approximately 2000 patients come to the practice of Felstehausen every quarter, in which the Northern German average practice is about 500.
In Asendorf, there is another home doctor practice.
A positive side effect of practice by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the apothecary remains in Asenddorf.
If no successor had been found, they would have gone too.
Those who visit Müller's speech hours also continue to look at their faces in confidence: they take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the rockhouses.
With its separation ends in Asenddorf an era, however, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"At first we only had two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen smugly.
A little wehmooth she's been spying on after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and many patients will be sure to see again," says the Internistist.
Your husband laughs: "We have a 6000 square metre base."
"Bisher, I've always pushed myself before gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two singles and they like to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now the border controls are also going high at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The checks at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also make this "self-evidently".
People's food and safety are at the forefront.
However, it is also clear that "there is a need for clear signals," the Minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled procedure.
Croatia considers Corridor denied Slovenia
The Croatian government had previously announced, and Slovenia also wanted to allow incoming refugees to travel further towards Austria and Germany and, under circumstances, to create corridors for refugees.
However, this was not the case with the Minister of the Interior of Vesna Györkös Znida in Laibach.
The idea of Corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will in fact intensify border monitoring - especially to Hungary.
On the other hand, the border with Croatia has already been heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to limit its borders to refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil his obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government reported, the first refugees had already tried in the hours of the night for Tuesday to enter eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been in contact with the Croatian Tovarnik ever since.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country with approximately 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected towards Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade argues that it is to suggest to people that certain routes should be put in place: "We can, we still want to do this," it said.
According to the media reports, in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The seats were all night from the Macedonian border, about 500 km away, through Serbia.
"We've heard that Hungary has made, so the police have told us that we should drive here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
To this end, it could in fact become a slightly further westerly route to the previous Balkan route of Turkey-Greece-Macedonian-Hungary-Hungary.
Croatia: Comprehensive possibilities for border control
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong flow of refugees.
He did not mention details, however, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member has "extensive possibilities for border control".
Strong checks are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Since 2007, Slovenia has been a member of the EU's partners since then, as far as border controls are concerned, a good witness has been given to the country.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain fully closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down early in the middle of the morning at a local sight in Horgos: he held the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It could not be said whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helps encourage migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee aid has already begun to distribute to the refugees maps on which alternative routes are signed by Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area, there are still unencumbered mine fields 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of miners in the border region had been sent.
Exchange hacker: Ukraine pays $30 million
Supranook is supposed to have heard a ring of cybercriminals, which is being proposed to have gained insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, MarketWired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information used should have included insider business on the financial markets.
In this way, the total amount of over $100 million was recovered from the investigators.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our country borders will finally be captured," says the SEC Communication.
The proceedings against 32 further defendants continued in the case.
Most of the defendants came from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators should have acted both in the USA and in Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospice aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Paradeplatz reigns in business.
People perform their concerns, partly quick steps, partly pleasantly booming.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim car salon at the parade.
Keep track of the city.
Pulsating, dirty life with beautiful autumn sun and in the middle of four large tables each with the title "Before I die"....
The economic aid has been paying attention to its 20-year-old existence with this action and is clearly confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lamer.
The Head of Economic Hospitality Assistance is also available to the passengers for questions and conversations as are the official staff.
While some spontaneous passersby grabs at the cricket and the sentence to "crush my life", "read", "run with the camper through the United States", "stop the war" or "do not suffer long", others stay short, read, say sentences like "so far I am not yet" and then go on.
Small discussions on the action on itself, on life, on how to deal with death continue to take place on the edge.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I make it clear to myself that the end will come to me in this world, I can live with responsibility," says the director of the Mennheim Diaconical Works, who is jointly with the Caritas Association of Economic Hospitality Aid.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20th year.
The fact that not everyone wants to make public on the tables is understandable, however, it is finally a very personal matter.
The topic of death and death is still covered by taboos, so the experience of Josefine Lamer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people.
An estimate shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the honorary employees of the first hour.
Faced with the subject of personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the death aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospitality Assistance sought by appeal, it was immediately notified and it was established in 1995.
Godefroid is a team of 45 honoraries - 43 women and two men - accompanied by the affected and members of private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
They're all trained carefully.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences involved.
"I see the life of another wait, hold it precious and value the moment," she says.
The offer of an ambulance is free of charge and free of charge.
The financial support of the hospitals and donations of members and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of the death and mourning staff.
Every two years, training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Additional personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards.
FedEx mixed result, financial perspectives reduced for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced its profit outlook for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that time, FedEx announced last year that the company wanted to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, 20 cent less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected according to a survey of FactSet $10.84.
The lower prospect comes despite the price increases, which average 4.9 percent and become effective on 4 January and despite higher subsidies for land transport from heavy and large packages to be collected from November.
The company said that it was still expected that the result against the previous year would be increased due to cost reduction, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Charman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "gives solid returns when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the rival UPS, which plans to set up 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, for example the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which twelve analysts asked for investment research.
The turnover rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zack's polled analysts expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has recorded a decline in international priority shipping, which led to a stagnation of sales in its unit of express shipping.
But the tree in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport sales increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $10.15.
On Tuesday, it closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record roof on 11 June.
At its most anticipated meeting in the year, the Federal Reserve Strategen spent two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time for the first time for almost a decade to raise the lead.
Threatening about them at the end of the depleted two-story meeting room, there is a wall image of the United States.
The map is a reminder that F-president Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation ahead of all other things.
The Central Bank has a two-fold mandate from the Congress: maximizing US employment and maintaining prices here.
But since the great recession, the fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start, from the exampleless incentive by the short-term interest rate lying near zero since the end of 2008.
Although most data from the economy show that it is growing solid, the latest turbulence in global financial markets could make the Feds already careful to increase this volatility by raising the interest on federal loans - and it is also only a quarter of a percentage.
"Of course, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they're watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the broker firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a precedent not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which will insure the financial market itself.
About half of the economies that were recently questioned by Bloomberg have predicted a rise in interest this week.
However, the financial markets are expected to wait for the Fed, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the sentence, unless the roadsides soften the battle by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial averaged 228,89 points or 1.4% to 16,599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy maintains the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the sentences at this time," he said.
If she does, "she has to go very far in her statement to calm down the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
One month ago, the Fed seemed to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow strengthening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA.
In the spring and in the spring, Yelles had said that this year, despite the complaints from Liberals, more economic progress would be necessary to expect an increase in the rate.
Although the creation of jobs slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was strong this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level considered by the fed as full employment.
Increases in wages have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation remained below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can manage higher interest rates and need them because of the pressure on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets all over the world came together at the end of the last month after China had lost its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 16% in May when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would reverse global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the dow now being almost 10% below the peak of May.
For the Fed representatives, the market turbulence affects the complex calculation when to increase the interest.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would be pulling the triggers at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. notary bank employee.
Now he says that they will wait at least a month to get the effects better in the grip.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there is hardly any reliable data that describes developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its finding.
But in the end, the Fed has become the currency authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication of the then head of Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "render" its monetary expansion, triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, the Fed representatives can expect to monitor developments not only elsewhere but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global asset management strategy of Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, this month noted that "the Fed has a history of reactions to financial market movements that are apparently not related to economic fundamental data."
Lacker, a qualified member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which used to raise interest, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its lead by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "in spite of the limited detectable impact on growth in the USA", Lacker said.
One year later, the Fed representatives withdrew these cuts.
The Fed should first place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the collapse of the market in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's Committee for Interest Banking.
The latest turbulences do not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest because the markets are excited," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that it should anticipate the time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market/store is a central location and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes about an hour to slip through the walk.
If the whole shopping cart makes you hungry, there is a meal in the LAX-C BBQ Express for you.
The garage (good and price) in this shop is close to the boxes and has various reception options.
What is there here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are priced and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat dish is extensive, as well as the fish dish - the staff behind the cake will clean up and filter the fish and even break on request for you.
A good part of the shop is part of the massive cooling department. Here you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melons and galgant, whole intestines, fish, beef and gall, pig-natural darm, fish balls, regional roots, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys in here: Restaurant owners and kitchens, including individual families and individuals.
The wide ranges are suitable for shopping cars and forklifts.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the box.
Where he is: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and the city center - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it's not hard to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small help for refugees
More and more refugees come to Germany these days.
Get you a warm welcome, not without the commitment of countless honorary helpers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support useless asylum seekers in the city.
They belong to Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
With her 74 lenses, she still enjoys teaching.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum competition house at the Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn German.
Of course, this is a whole different teaching than at a real school.
Brazil's Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy lifestyles
The Brazilian Paediatric Organization SPRS tries to shockly explain to women how important good food is during the time of silence. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who suck on breasts that are painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers will be able to increase their daily calorie intake to about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results indicated that higher calorie consumption is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A current study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that healthy feeding of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions to the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipality of Bernried approved the construction fee for the 2.3 million euro teure sporthalle.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be smoother for solar system.
The plans for the long-standing construction of tournaments at the Bernreid sports grounds are taking place step by step: at the recent municipal meeting, the planned construction fee was awarded in full without much discussion.
The board had previously decided, among other things, to apply for a "exception" or "exemption" of the applicable construction plan.
The "exception" was the permit for a special form of roof construction.
Then a "satteldach with non-middle first and roof cover" is to be built.
The reason for the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems: "This brings us together a wonderfully large south," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
In the case of "freedom", the roof was to lie below ten degrees for energy reasons - other than in the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "freedom" was therefore necessary because the construction plan for the roofing does not allow "exemption" - in which Bernrieder's municipality is usually more restrictive in the case of relief applications.
However, in the construction of tournaments, it is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The tournament building at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and of the SV Bernried.
At the cost, about 2.3 million euros are calculated.
Grants are expected from the promotion of school and broadband.
In the next step, the construction fee for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now submitted to the Land Council for examination.
Pißenberg clinic takes to Schongau
The Pißenberg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - that is 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become the new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of the employees are from Pittenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the district, confirmed by Landrätsin Andrea Jochner-White, are.
However, a decision is taken by the Supervisory Board, and it will take place on Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the almost 50 staff at the hospital in Pittsburgh would continue to work.
The vast majority are to move with fishermen and the remaining internal station to Schongau.
The rooms are there.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, as Jochner-White.
The employees are informed of the plans.
The change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been the medical director of Schongauer Clinic only since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice closer to the hospital.
On the question of who should follow up, according to Jochner-White, the name "Fischer" came into the game, who was ready to take the lead from October 1st and move with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case a "revaluation" and a distribution of the offer in the field of "Intern medicine", as Jochner-White.
Fisher is a specialist in heart disease and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases at the inner station.
Transitional for the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will lead both houses, until next year the former hospital of the struggle, which has over 35 beds, will be finally closed in Pittenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018 when the current recovery at the Weilheim Hospital was completed.
Landrätin Jochner-White, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, opposed allegations that the house, which is owned by the federal minority, should be used in the future as accommodation for asylum seekers.
"I'm closing it." As it goes on with the property, Jochner could not say that there are several discussions.
Currently, there is a short-term care of Caritas and a daily psychiatric treatment.
"What better thing could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," says Fischer about the Quasi ride to the body that was recorded by the employees "positive and very understanding".
There has been no real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the positions of the Medical Director.
The Pißenberg Hospital (one hundred beds) has been threatened with closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and birth care.
The handballs of the Rhine-Neckar Löwen are required this evening (20.15 p.m.) at the Bergsian HC.
In Wuppertal, however, the Federal Board of Directors is the clear favourite, but there is no cause for overriding.
In the last season, the bathers at BHC had a painful downfall and had some good tastes there.
Hunting accident with two injured in Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured during their maestro on Tuesday afternoon by shots.
During the evening on a corn field at Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg) several hunters were in use, as the police reported.
After a shot, a 63- and 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospitals.
Just as it could have happened, it was not clear at first.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violence
A suspect has led the police to the body of 16-year-olds from Rheinland-Pfalz who have been missing since Saturday.
In the hearing, the 20-year-old added that the young people were killed and that their bodies had been thrown into a canal in Rockenhausen.
Since Saturday, 16-year-olds from Rheinland-Pfalz have been killed by a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday in Rockenhausen at Kaiserslautern, as state prosecutors and police reported on Wednesday.
As a suspect, a 20-year-old who was arrested on Tuesday night was also considered guilty and led the investigator to the founding place of the body.
The 16-year-old was missed on Sunday morning after she had not come home on the night after visiting a autumn party in Rockenhausen.
When looking for the young woman, the investigators first focused on personal objects of the victim.
Finally, when questioned in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing people, a suspicion was expressed against the 20-year-olds.
The mob then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The detainee informed the authorities in the police hearing that the 16-year-old was killed and that the body had been placed in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be brought to the courthouse on Wednesday, and the investigators would have him killed.
A conclusion on the more detailed circumstances of the case should be drawn from further investigations.
Refugees need accommodation: study warns against apartment accidents
The situation on the German apartment market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for a payable stay.
The pressure on the apartment market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long begun.
With the coming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with poor people for the last affordable apartments.
In order to cover the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units had to be built each year by 2020.
This results in a study on behalf of the Association of Social Housing.
For comparison: 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
That's why 140,000 apartments are missing.
Refugees are no longer obliged to live in an asylum-seeker after the first three months of their stay.
Many then hit the apartment market and choose to enter the long snakes in front of the apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not limited to the rising numbers of refugees.
The study has also made significant gaps in housing policy over the last few years.
Germany is facing a housing deficit, which is growing from year to year.
Currently, about 770,000 housing units were missing in the dance areas, accused Matthias Günther, author of the study.
For this reason, many professionals lived in large cities in WG-rooms.
Young adults remained reluctantly in the "Hotel Mama" because of the fluctuation in the apartment market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per head was reduced for the first time in the past years.
In order to solve the problem, the association proposes a new start for social housing.
New incentives should be re-encouraging social housing.
In this way, the basic taxes could be waived and the basic taxes imposed on funded apartments would be suspended.
In addition, according to the Bond, attractive tax options are necessary.
The support programme for refugee refugees from the KfW State Bank is already a good one in cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start of Monday, more than half of the EUR 300 million available had already been collected with 184 million on Monday.
Now the project could even be suspended.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia set up Corridor
After Hungary there is virtually no more passage, as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces to provide the trip through Slovenia to the north without any threats.
The route is dangerous, but still.
Croatia intends to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the removal of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have been displaced to Croatia in order to reach Western Europe.
500 people came across the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV RTL.
Hungary had set its borders for refugees on the morning.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make the orderly asylum procedures virtually superfluous in Hungary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who live and want to achieve something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had attacked Croatia's first refugees on the border of Serbia in the morning.
Most of the media reports came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by taxis to the Serbian border city of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot over the green border.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees did not cross the border.
There are other dangers to the border lines: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslavian civil war in the 1990s.
Mine-spacers are about to quickly create a safe passage.
After Hungary, almost more refugees arrive after the border is closed.
On Tuesday, 366 people were arrested by the police.
Shortly before the end of the month, there were 9380.
The new Hungarian laws include the overcrowding and damaging of the border boy as a criminal offence.
Therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern border city of Szeged.
The convicted are threatened with imprisonment for up to five years and the removal from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" on the border, almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition of Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
In the middle of the morning, there were still 40 refugees.
However, practically no one has a chance to receive asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be removed there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Ruszke, workers began to grow up.
They collected the garbage, leaving tens of thousands of people on the road in the last few weeks.
Sperrgitter was demolished and one of the recording sites in the border site was rebuilt.
For the purpose of this reconstruction, no one wanted to express themselves.
Austria reaches only a few refugees after the border between Serbia and Hungary is closed.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, according to government data, the 20,000 migrants were still in the country.
In Salzburg about 1,400 people are waiting for the move to Germany.
The transport from there to Germany was stopped on the morning of the German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly entered.
The mayor ran "Gestrandette" across the border
"We were busy with cleaning after the bridge on Sunday, when suddenly ten people with travel bags were at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
Because on Sunday, however, because of the fluctuations, Germany had surprisingly set up rail traffic with Austria, it was in Wernstein Castle for her," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the beachmen along with two other helpers and their cars over the border to the nearby Passau.
Previously, we had missed the unexpected guests only once, with juice and drinks.
We just said we'd take them by car to Passau.
"That was for us of course," said Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man did not have to make a generous donation - 100 euros for the firefight.
"We are very pleased," said Stadler.
The beached train passengers were on Sunday in Wels from an ICE in a regional train direction Passau to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that rail traffic was introduced to Germany.
However, the regional train was postponed in front of the border in Wernstein at the Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival is associated with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, days before a two-block race sport - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a clear policy:
Instead of helping immediately with the creation of structures to ensure humanity in the Röszke camp, our federal chancellor has put the attitude of the Hungarian government in the dark circle of national socialism.
The leaders of this policy are not only the Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to find that the "dead country", which they have invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
There will be a great challenge in view of the ongoing flows of refugees and the coming winter, to create decent conditions for protection seekers.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad on the search for 35,000 winter-fested quarters
Konrad has all his hands full with the escape.
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raifeis banker to establish quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording center of Traiskirchen has already reached Konrad in the grip.
"We no longer have homeless in Traichurchs," he reported from his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also done without great vertebrates, Konrad said and praised the organizational "mastership".
On the other hand, the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a "critical situation".
Overall, Konrad has a requirement of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 more accommodation will have to be found next week - 20,000 will be provided by the countries, 15,000 of the federation.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it is not a facade without soil," said Konrad.
He's already had a conversation with the national leaders.
They would have assured him that they would also create accommodation for the future refugees.
"In Upper Austria it is going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP driver supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, explaining how the church will help.
Large expectations the asylum coordinator also puts in the ORF action "Help as we do".
On the platform, private persons can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, you hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticised yesterday the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of need, it could not be that Quartiers must maintain a certain height of the hand-holds or the size of the upper lights.
For a limited time, "not standards" should apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad is more successful in his experience.
I am an older Lord, who is not told in the face of the lie without any other.
Convinced power is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any costs, as they themselves explained.
Their number of employees wants to increase by three to four.
The search for their own quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there are obviously problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
First, there is no opening of urban sports and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, since it is possible to stop the people concerned without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, further locations should be examined for the emergency.
Criticism is practiced by the head of the city in the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other areas must also contribute here.
Seehofer: "Greens are not fixed"
In a longer phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday to continue the process in the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be settled.
The continuation of the journey from refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now just the corresponding border controls.
There will be no more special flights with refugees to Germany.
However, the applicants would be brought by regular trains to Germany.
From the other EU Member States, Pühringer once called for greater solidarity in the issue of refugees.
Now that Austria is re-introducing controls at its borders, Pühringer is "a logical consequence" from the German process.
The next runtastic is a question of time
The generalization of the "New Werft" in the Linzer industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T was selected, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In the IT are the smart heads of our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T Chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies in the New Werft and then acquire any.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - some of whom Niederhauser promises: "The next runtastic is just a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the techcenter, which belongs to each third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Republic (FFG).
The building is contaminated by the Linz AG for 60 years to S&T as well as Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining area in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni-owner opened second business in the arcade
In the new shop, Furla handbags are in the center.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to have a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to take a short walk in the Taubenmarkt Arkade: she has now grown up in the form of another business place.
In the Furla shop, compared to the store where they sell bags, suitcases, shoes and clothes from different manufacturers, everything is now turning around to have ladies' handbags of the Furla brand, money exchanges are from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday, the new shop is in operation.
It was rebuilt several weeks earlier.
"But I've spent a long time wondering if I should open another charge," says Breit.
In view of the decision, among other things, the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also affected by the idea of their own location where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the big room Linz who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who owns Italian roots.
Your fashion interest has got width from her mother into the waves.
Most of the time, if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why such a few women are in good spirits when looking at a nice handbag, the expert cannot answer with the latest certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag evaluates every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Callstadt
The Pälzer prefects of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are named.
This property is also linked to the billionaire who wants to become president of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he is foreignly opposed, journalists are concerned with anger or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. President's office strongly provokes the election struggle.
And cut it well.
This is also recorded in the Pfälschen Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the Föhnfrisur is a concept in the Winzerdorf on the wine street.
Some in the 1200-occupational location are over -zig corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the electoral struggle.
The Call City woman Simone Wendel was filming a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about their goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think those who find it kind of exciting, but they're not as deeply impressed in their kallstadt, either," says Simone Wendel.
The famous Kollstadter has turned a amusing documentary film about the place and its famous Sprösslingen, which includes the Ketchup family Heinz, in addition to Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, comes to "Kings of Callstadt" (2014) as well - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Callstadt.
He did not bring it to the king of hearts.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tends to think that Trump is "a bit big", says Wendel.
At random, the name of the peak, the town of Callal, is said to be "The Brulljesmacher" - in German: the integrator, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the intruders.
The Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later Grandfather expanded and in the United States opened a site for gold miners.
The real estate company's first land purchases were in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: your desire to return to the home for a long time, escaped to the Bavarian state of which the people belonged at the time.
He did not take Trump because he was once unauthorized, the director of the Institute for Pfalzic History and Folk Art, Roland Paul, had declared the film launch.
Trump is the encle of an "illegal emigrator".
This contrasts with the underlying marked statements of the offspring.
He had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and asked to build a border wall to scare illegal immigrants.
"As the copter, it's not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative Trumps ("The grandmother was a born trumpet, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The winner at rest sees the American rather distant, "he's always so exhausting".
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Call City."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadter, that a descendant of the Heinz family spent something on a visit to the church organ, which was generally well achieved.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
She found it better if he didn't win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who had the case at the time of his grandfather in the United States were like him, "we never even got there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzerdichter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It isn't my president," she says.
And, "The grapes will also be ripe without the President Trump."
In the United States, 12 000 filmmakers have seen the film for which the Trump has been interviewed.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
At the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfenig, the 1800-resident village of Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "Gergsteiger villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpenverein is responsible for the award of the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have no more than 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be identified as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite Nina's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at today's show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson moved to Canberra to report the loss of the Liberal leadership, but there have been no major changes in the evaluations for today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the Bundeshauptstadt, when Malcolm Turnbull created Tony Abbott's storm.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a weekly series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise achieved an average of 397.000 spectators in the five major cities, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the rates for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in the last few months.
Today, on average, 318,000 reached the 330,000 of Sunrise in August.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise stands at 314,000 viewers at today's average.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thanks for the check!

The great novelty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently white father who decides to leave with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit show Solo without the rappers Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "Yes".
The X-factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million spectators and slightly beat The Block (838.000) and TBL families (726.000).
Seven had mixed results at night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 5.30 p.m.) of the new Quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe scored on average 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) ran to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (613.000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 viewers, and in the second half hour it was 720,000.
Hot seat on average 620,000.
The decline in the rates of the second evening of The Chase Australia will be more likely to agree that the hot-seat will finally be held at 17:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute that didn't make it to fly the McGuires Show.

The last three votes agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unmistakably revealed who won The Bachelor.
The woman who finally landed Sam Wood in The Bachelor was kept secret.
And not one of the three remaining girls will certainly be rewarded if she is the one who has received the last rose.
But when we checked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before they were two, you may have accidentally indicated who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips shut until the final on Thursday
All three women were lyrical about why Wood was the perfect man and called his sense of humor, pride, family values and positive attitude as a reason why they wanted to be his partner.
However, when the question is asked, "If you don't, who should get Woods' last rose?", their answers to the player who won the heart of the bachelor could become the loser.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski called both fast - except for themselves - Mackay as the best partner for wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought about it all over the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands on the ground with both feet, it makes so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I've seen them together, and they've got the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
In her view, Mackay said that last week the house visit made it clear that Wood could be one.
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unrestricted on him," she said.
And when she was asked, who would choose Wood if she wasn't, she was stubborn.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the rest of the girls alike - it's a disagreement between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m., on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches had banned Hayne for the rest of the game at the bank when he lost a ring like the Aussie-Rugby-Liga conversion at his first point return on Tuesday at 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point-back and also in the current game after a breach of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of slandering his smokes before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged her.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49er sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who dares him to forget his captured catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fits at a point that was restored in the first game district of Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the beginning, the Hayne and his massive Australian succession for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the playing field after the fumble and later told Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1, that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the snitzer to his original debut in 2007, when a pass led to a trial for Queensland in his own in-goal area.
However, it was a great experience for the 27-year-olds.
Hayne posted for a photo with fans and kept an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of slaves
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian rally with weapons.
After he had openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company attacked Yukos and subjected his democratic efforts.
The free voters are calling for the establishment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
Party and Group Chief Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW-Herbstklustur in Großwallstadt against a severe crisis in Bayern's schools, if there are no new teachers for the many new students, "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing," Awanger said.
"Unfortunately, we'll get some redundancies in the Bavarian education system."
The Land Day fraction of the free voters takes place until Friday in the subterranean municipality.
In fact, all other main topics were envisaged.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the free election meeting.
"Of course, the topic of asylum will be overloaded by the clause," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it did during the Yugoslavian war in the nineties.
"That's not the way it goes, we have to do the reasons," said the Free Voter Chief.
Declined asylum seekers want to remove the free voters as quickly as possible.
For this reason, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative court responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum lawyers," Aiwanger said.
The head of the FW criticised that several federal countries were not consistent: "We need federal uniform standards."
"Bayern moves off, others don't."
"That's where we need to be more capable of action."
However, national policy in the big city should not fall below the table.
A year-long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
In the new school year, Culture Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot test "Middle Plus" at 47 Gymnasia, which tests an extension of the high secondary level from three to four years - the result then lasts nine years to the high school.
But that's not enough for Aiwanger.
"The G9 theme needs to be accelerated," said the FW Chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all gymnasiums who want to do so.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Fester Wall Street helps Dax to jump
The German stock market has closed after a wide range of direct and nervous trades with profits.

Solid wins also booked the trading venues in London and Paris.
In the United States, the Dow-Jones index last noted about 1 percent in the plus.
Many Borsians expect the markets to take place on this Friday until after the interest decision in the United States and also for the major fall in the scheduled exchange on Friday.
The debate on the loads from the nuclear power plant has, at the same time, pushed RWE's shares to a record depth and left deep traces for Eon.
According to the mirror, the German energy groups may lack 30 billion euros in deposits.
The Federal Government deplored the numbers mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly, but finally lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares increased at the Dax point by another 3.22 percent.
According to one dealer, a positive report from the US deposit store "Barron's" came after the weekend.
Thus, investors paid too little attention to the German chipmaker at the moment.
Investments in future waver technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid out.
Car values were asked: Even in the traditional weak summer month of August, more cars were replaced than in the previous year, as the Acea Industrial Association announced at the beginning of the International Motor Show in Frankfurt.
Daimler and BMW autobuilder's paper added by 1.34 per cent or 2.21 per cent.

The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) Euro.
4 people killed after police shooting rubber shots on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot in a crowd of people who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi District, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Chief District Officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police had used Trengengas and then shot into the air before she got back on rubber shots.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber boots used, of which it is known that they can kill, but which are traditionally used as less lethal alternatives, apparently produced such a high rate of death.
The dispute was the last week of violent protests in southern Nepal, where members of the ethnic group of the Madhesi said that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflicts since 10.
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial topic in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Old Post Youth Centre is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the sale of the 4000 square meters area.
A mixture of trade, commerce and housing is planned - concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a large plot of approximately 4,000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Old Post youth center.
Preparations are currently under way.
It is planned to use the land for a mixture of trade, trade and housing.
You wait for the corresponding offers, it's from the city.
If any investor's inquiring, don't be clear.
As a result, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had purchased part of the property located on the Ringstraße / Ecke Grandestraße, already a few months ago and had the building on it beautified.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home at the small sea at Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Some investors are still concerned - they fear the sale of their holiday home
For months, closed doors were negotiated, grumbled, debated and signed.
Now the plans for a new holiday home on the small sea Emden are on the table.
The interest, the mid-term office company "System-Bau", presented its plans to the public for the first time on Monday in the Council's Urban Development Committee.
Originally, this item was on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critic and the FDP Group, who proposed to the investors and the administration of the secret cremerei, Ralf Behrends went to the offensive from the system building management: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
It has been in the debate for about ten to twelve million Euros for months.
The pictures and new details of the hotel’s construction were called for by shipowners who came to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, the shipowner and board member at the stake of the investors, Pro Hieve, complains: "It is a giant castle that surpasses all other buildings".
He also fears, like several other project critics, that traffic by the intended size of the plant would increase strongly: "There must be all loads of buses in order to calculate it," said Schulz.
However, what is happening on the good part of a hectar large area of the former guesthouse is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"First we must have a key concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still lacking, the construction plans are still variable.
Twinnings growth at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurter Zoo is happy about growing up in his gorillas.
The 26-year-old Diana brought twins to the world yesterday.
The birth of twins is rare in Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years back and it was also in Frankfurt in 1967, called the Zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla-willing is still not determined, since Mother Diana has kept it close to her body so far.
At first, the "image" had reported.
NHC tells 60 percent chance for Cyclones south of Cape Verden islands
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday a wide printing system of approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verden islands, which has a 60% chance to develop into a tropical vertebral storm in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined printing system, for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Minor Antilles, also has a 60% potential to form a tropical vertebral storm in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts double donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a duplicating donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organisations, to help thousands of refugees who have overwrought the European nations, as they flee from the war to a state of poverty.
Google has an unusually personal approach to making the donation bill on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experience.
"We had many dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations to provide help for refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global funds collected up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled the war-ravaged Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.
Report by Yasmeen Abutaleb; working by Christian Plumb
For mildly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote a guide to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositional surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, adipositionas operations have proven to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill-fated with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in relation to size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI of more than 30 are considered fat-like.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 comparing two types of adipositionas surgery - stomach bypass and stomach tumor formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The mean BMI of those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
In the meantime, the BMI remained at approximately 29 years of age for those who received non-surgical diabetes treatment.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% of the diabetes mellitus was completely and 28%.
In the medically-treated group, in comparison, diabetes was completely resolved only by one percent and in part by only about two percent.
In addition, the results of blood pressure controls, triglycerides and the "bad" LDL cholesterol were "in general better in the "surgical" group", the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient’s blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
However, in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, so the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compares average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gastrextomy group (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), reached greater reductions in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs 2.1%) and recorded a complete excess of diabetes (46.9% vs 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, Blackstone says from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, about 29 percent less likely to die during the 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any benefit in the survival of the surgical patients, Blackstone said it was comforting for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"That is the critical point of this study, because she says this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we've waited too long for people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have collected these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a conversion is really hard."
Love story playing in the back of the dog
It is a topic that is now growing in beauty: A young woman, unaccompanied and indistinct at school, meets her youth's blackness again after years, and she loves her.
So also in the recent novel "We're actually not like that" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the story of love, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding towns.
The main professional author has grown up in Langweiler and is happy that she was able to place a literary monument to her home.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not take all refugees, the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of the violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of its ten-day visit to the United Kingdom on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethical studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents under the circumstances.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was surprising, but the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria praised efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To care for several thousand refugees, it is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, how a real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how killing in their countries is reduced.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attack of 11 September and reported that the violent reaction of the United States had drawn a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I put my companion in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in no violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he put on violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the use of hand infection by children over the last 4 years
Gift control centres in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who have suffered severe alcoholic hand infection, says the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gailord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of intake of hand infection in children under 12 years of age reported by poison control centres rose from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them are going to go to emergency reception," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a courageous trial in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young disinfectants drink only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing mouth water to obtain a stronger drink.
Younger children can be Angelified by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think it's bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those who are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape juice and orange juice that are very suitable for children.
Hand infection agents contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, few spruces can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is the most concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison care centre at the University of Kansas University, sending Fox 4 to Kansas City.
So, you wouldn't let a lot of whisky out there, but people let these hand disinfectants in the range of children, and when children come to it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaija Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four sprays of hand infection at school from post-earth beer, was taken into emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that is legally applicable to an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, a emergency therapy doctor who treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaiyah called her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital on signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN said.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and to store hand infections outside the child's range.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with fatalities.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after the slaughter of hand infection agents, which contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials assume that the product contains methane, a lethal solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which has been recorded as an active substance.
In January, three of the fourth grade students in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by exposing antibacterial products around the teaching area," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand infection and banned her from her room.
The police viewed the plan as a "debt" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authorities.
Villingen-Schwingingen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver has been easily injured in an accident at the crossing between the Nordring and the Herden.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the cross-country road towards the industrial area and took it too late to know that two leading vehicles had stopped in the circuit.
As a result, he threw his truck into the corner of an auditorium and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta.
In the accident-related vehicles, property damage amounting to around EUR 10,000 is reported by the police.
The 33-year-old audience was no longer ready and had to be dragged off.
Newsroom: No Disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the grid of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deala says that the Hopes are in a bad place, but that he will turn it again.
Hearts will fight SFA because of Neilson's charge and Warburton will be careful about January new obligations that could destroy the unit of the camp.
Dos increase lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half of the time Aberdeen gave a short victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays Straightly over Disharmony Down
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was deliberately rejected by Griffiths. This was because he and his team comrades are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch tablekeeper.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football unfortunately Netherlands - de Boer
The former Rangers midfield player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently a messenger for Ajax, said, "In Holland they don't show any highlights of Celtic games anymore and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not only talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the old firm games, and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, Deala swears.
RONNY Deala has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
Following the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent exclusion from the Champions League, the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen, which now stands at the top of the table with five points ahead.
But Delilah said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll be back."
Now we want to get out as quickly as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's going on.
We feel that way - but we have to move on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
It's so important to be together now.
Warburton Careful on January Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he had signaled some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new tickets and insists that he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox-Cader's unit.
The former head of Brentford said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in summer have this season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is arranged by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with return notice
Swansea stormer Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in the conversation, has indicated that he can withdraw if his contract expires at the Swans.
The 29-year-old has been engaged with a lousy knee for two years and has not made the withdrawal from Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA battle set because of neilsons comments
The hearts carried 2:1, when Fatherson was sent out of the field and then lost 3:2, but the red card of the defender was later removed - the third red card of Columbus, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains in what he said, and continues: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The unforgivable hibee was justified after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about Ex-Hearts Player Rudi Skacel.
The event took place in a button in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the stormer and added, "It's safe to say that I'm not going back to Tynecastle if it's not for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has trust in Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but says that the downfall must end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We'll bring the boys back to work," said Donnelly.
McInnes was glad to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes argues that his team from Aberdeen had to fight Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory, which led them to five points before Celtic at the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half.
McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything, in poker games or leagues that have not even won this kind of game."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it increases in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July by 164,000, while the number of unemployed people for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as shown by the figures of the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, the employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a number above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The long-term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
Circumstances disrupted the course
Since the security staff could not clear the situation, the employees called the police.
Only with the use of pepperspray could the officers take care of the disturbances.
A breath alcohol test was performed at a 16-year-old 0,89 promille.
The adult was taken from his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2,15 promille and first remained in caution.
Why I'm going to be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a later legal intervention, I will see how a man is killed.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison sprites.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to be afraid.
So, why would I do that?
I agreed, because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see facilities in the United States, and often more applications than places are available, there is a makeable lottery to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Anyone who is selected will observe it emotionally.
I can't.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephones and a visit of two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a note book and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants, and you get access.
I'm complaining about her.
She admitted that "she could have formulated it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he would.
I told him he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks the public work of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I have made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of being a favor to the fact.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his orientation is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'm going to see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn.
What you get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man beat up after a wet police chase hunt to get out of the Canning River
The Canning Valley policeman remained dry when he beat the man off the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the muddy and smoldering water, only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "be gentle to talk about returning to the shore."
The police of Canning Vale were called on Tuesday for a house break in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I won't come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to make his uniform naked, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - "a good cop negotiated".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
The winning football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car to the grave to escape an alcohol check and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired natives to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race sport
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his states last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had carried out a personal campaign against him with the late Scratching of Lady Tatai due to a rental treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he has faced himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt tipper test at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had stayed for 18 months because of the spying proposals and did not want it "to look like too hanging grapes."
"I had to say nothing about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that it's all coming out at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around the raised capital, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy its stable.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Daily Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I'm asked - and offered him a job in my seats to provide information about what I'm doing within my seats," Moody said at Racing.com.
You obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly get stuck in their noses because they have failed to catch me when trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, the official president of the RVL and Bernard Sundry, the current CEO of the RVL, were aware of it at the time and are still there today.
Should that make me think it's going to be personal?
Did the RVL behave smoothly and perhaps make people out of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and break me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying will allow them to think about it now.
But I have now come to the point where it is not right for me, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and force them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration level of the coach has been built up with the long ongoing cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late Scratching led him to say that he "can throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unbeatable Master Black Caviar, referred to the raceday treatment rule as "laughing", after a pack of sludge or ton was placed on the horse legs, which is contrary to the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees has mistakenly put a bullet on his leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like yesterday all day, whatever it was.
But it was the same on Sunday.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with packaging on the day of the week. An examination of this issue was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you have gone too far," said Moody.
Man arrested after a driver's flight
On the weekend, the police arrested a man after a clash with a bicycle driver and then a driver in Cobram.
The bike driver was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia was present at the police station in Shepparton.
It is expected to be charged for driver's flight and assistance and for other traffic offences.
The bike driver, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy fights against rivals because of claims to ring fights back
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has described criticism at the touch of his players as "Agenda setting" by two premium League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Rooster's Trainer Trent Robinson said that the judges allowed the storm players "ringfighting" with his team during the high storm victory at the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly hidden remark to the storm team after his team won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening. He called the game a "pattern example" of Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the tacklime of his team and said that they were focused only on their "contact" during the tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team was likely to vote for him, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the storm team.
"This always happens - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they hit us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything to our defensive system or techniques all year round. But in the last six weeks, we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has brought us the trend.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing it, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It is already funny how this is always happening to this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "excellent football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawra Dragons won the 2010 Premier League with "long-term" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting her game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticised as a boring team, and Wayne said he'd take care of a piece of shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I build more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it came to Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are there breaks and no points exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet them in one phase.
The storm team is free to receive this weekend, as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday evening at the AAMI Park. The ticket sale starts on Tuesday morning.
Serbia with $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man who may be threatened by a life-long penalty because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine that were smuggled to Queensland was released against a bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drugs on the yacht Solay, who came from South America over Vanuatu and set up in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was watched as he met his fellow prisoners in the yacht in the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life-long penalty for trying to own a commercial quantity of cocaine, the counsel of Maximovic argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the whole quantity and that it could have been for a harmless reason at the café.
The judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of flight at Maximovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the crime, he told the police about his place of residence.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had offered a deposit of $200,000 as security together to achieve his release.
"After reading the two people's statements, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maximovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he gives up his Australian and Serbian passport, reports to the police daily and keeps himself at a starting lock of 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 at Karlsruhe: Führerhaus travels apart
A truck driver was seriously injured during a three-storey accident at Karlsruhe on Tuesday night.
Two of the three involved trucks had been braked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried to avoid the left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The driver's house of the accident triggers completely apart.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for over six hours until 2 o'clock.
There was a damage of EUR 122,000.
Steven Hogg's phone was used by girls to lock paedophile to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when he was asleep, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of images that were sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed the computers that were found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used the terms for the search for inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officers that he had done it because it would lead to "Pedophile on the Internet" and then he "destroyed to be a policeman to scare them".
State attorney Elidhi Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a search - that he was a coward to scare people.
He said that the searches were carried out on the computer by him, but he said it was because he wanted to be a cop to scare paedophile.
He was asked after his talks with the stranger who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he was sick in his head when he was drinking, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was at the cider and the wine.
She also saw the inappropriate images on the phone and confronted the defendants.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and Playstation used to talk to girls who look much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, accused himself of having taken images of children on 14 June last year, to have violated the charges on 25 January of this year, and not to appear before the court at a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defendant lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" was found in his past.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael moved the sentence until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but because of hearings with others still pending cases, it was kept under investigation.
He was included in the sexual offenders' list before the date of the judgment.
Schleusers switch to small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being attacked at the German-Austrian border from the point of control.
Many lockers were afraid to discover and arrest the people increased to smaller border crossings
on the Austrian side out, a spokesperson of the Federal Police said.
Following the Inn border, more than 1,000 refugees have been arrested in the Passau and Rottal-Inn districts since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side by foot over bridges and bridges.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to registration.
At the Munich Main Station, after federal police figures compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday, more refugees met again.
By 8:00 a.m., about 700 people arrived in the capital, a speaker said in the morning.
After reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, on Tuesday, 1759 refugees had reached the city.
Stuttgart: Tropensturm "Henry" is expected in the south-west
Meteorologists warn against storms in the southwest of midnight.
The German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart is currently operating in hot sea air because of a deep pressure area across Western Europe.
The strong depth was the exit of the "Henry" tropical storm, which had been swept over the Atlantic in the past days by the Bermuda Islands.
Strong storms and winds are expected mainly in baths.
According to DWD, it is still to be expected to be in the Black Forest until Thursday morning, on the Swiss Alb and on the ground seekreis with bows of 60 to 90 kilometers.
On Friday, then, the sun can be seen for a longer time.
The mass makes it: Every two years the autobuilder shows on the IAA its new features.
2015 is mainly to be recorded in the compact cars, which are currently very well sold.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly asked: around 28.1 percent of the new permits are awarded according to the Power Travel Office (KBA) alone in August on this segment.
This is also reflected in the IAA (Public Days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented this year in particular.
One of the biggest prizes for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be held in the autumn by the dealers.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
He's one of the cores of the brand.
In order for the volume model to be sold well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive for it.
Opel represents an entry below the largest competing VW golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 litre engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
In addition, the Hessens offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW/200 PS, which are also included for the first time in tricycle cylinders.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, there is the Opel Astra at first only as five.
The second variant will be followed by the van in the spring, which is already visible on the IAA.
And what's going to happen to new compact cars next to the Astra on the IAA?
Renault Megane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra-competitive Megane into the race.
At the fair, the Megane can only be seen as a five-year-old in a conventional and accentuated sporty GT version.
In the trade, he will start next year, then also as a van.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is a whole new segment.
The Nissan Abeleger wants to find its position with the new model in the highly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti fits fully with its curved lines into the design line of the brand.
The base model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
In the offer there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premieres in Frankfurt.
The model with petrol engines is offered, including a newly developed 1,0 litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum torque is located at 170 Newton meters (Nm).
The sale of the Baleno in Europe is in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not quite new, but around it is the compact class model DS 4, which is to be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble citroën-absorber put hand in hand at the front: Here the cooler grill was redesigned and the modified light bulbs with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was particularly modernised, the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apples CarPlay.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are listed in the IAA compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are highly respectable
The Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex-con of the Tegel Judicial Institute, which was held in a very small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are placed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
The judges may even hope for money even if they were confined to the narrow spaces for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This led to the success of an ex-con with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was placed in the Berlin-Tegel Judicial Centre between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of ground area; the toilet was not spaced.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer, was now on his own foot again, was placed in a larger cell.
He was sentenced to death in prison because of the undeserved conditions of imprisonment against the Land of Berlin.
However, the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and re-examined the case there.
You see the human dignity of the man injured.
Court of Justice now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of the period in question were necessary for compensation, a claim was made, it was said.
Otherwise, "a guardian of the legal protection of the person would be afraid".
The Court of Justice must now clarify the amount of damages.
In the past, the constitutional courts have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
So they only spoke to a prisoner in April because he was naked in a cell.
A 2011 decision, according to which the multiple placement of a cell without a separate toilet, is not human.
In addition, Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The complainant was kept in a cell of the same type as in Karlsruher for more than three months each day between 15 and 21 hours.
In the last few weeks, the Berlin prisons had also come to the strike lines because of the lack of personnel.
Prisoners are therefore constantly arrested for 23 hours, increasing aggressiveness, even in battles, because of the tense situation.
Upon receipt of the press, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied due to a lack of maturity, 19 are due to disappear in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the Refugee Policy: "We create this"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What's going on in Germany?
About 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to Vizekanzler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) Germany is even able to take up a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can create it, and we create it."
What happens in Germany is the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Ministry of Tree) and 400000 (estimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments are needed annually - i.e. the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as previously built (250,000 apartments).
The lack of living space is dramatic, but especially in the case of affordable rental facilities: 60000 to 80000 social apartments are out of the rental price bond annually, and for these particularly favourable apartments, refugees will also apply.
The Federal Ministry of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to a billion euros.
Much too little has been done in the opinion of the Pestel Institute: 80,000 social apartments had to be created annually and for this, the feds had to invest a grant of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Ministry of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55 per cent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them when entering, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to the value assessment in the recording society, but also to the sense of self-value of immigrants, says Migrations researcher Dietrich Tränhardt.
In Germany, according to Threnhardt, there has been a political change: from the ban on working for refugees to recognise work.
While there was a ban on work for asylum seekers from up to five years ago, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence obligation that asylum seekers were restricted to a place of residence.
In the society - also because of the lack of expertise - the majority of the views that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly have been put forward.
A great deal of access to the labour market is lacking in German knowledge.
So far, there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses.
In addition, surveys show that jobs are most often communicated by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore in the light of Threnhardt's king's path to labour integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to the Kitas, estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the disappointed parents it is only very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the Kita, the administration distributes handsets in different languages.
If the need for educators by the large number of refugees rose strongly, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more schools.
In the countries, students are prepared for teaching without German knowledge in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
They do not lack, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The German student team estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no Bundesland asylum seekers or patients undercut the study - the only exception was until Berlin, Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Studyable refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
Because refugees with a residence permit or extension will no longer receive benefits under the asylum-seeker performance law when they start a study.
The latter do not, in principle, receive an addition because they do not fall within the circle of the eligible persons.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for up to four years to be Bafeg-authorised, from January 1, 2016, this span is shortened to 15 months.
However, this funding gap also needs to be closed, Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Student Network.
The students should be given an immediate boost.
Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should successfully grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and further develop the existing State-Church law into a new state-religious relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association, which is professionally responsible for the new arrivals.
The rights also include obligations.
In this way, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the State in many areas and to provide it with certain control options.
This is also part of the readiness to take a stand against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the President of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to create such conflicts in Germany, "at once they have their right to live here, in Germany, to work," he said in the Bavarian Rundfunk.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arabic.
Integration will be much more than today as a topic of the whole society.
In order to change the majority society too, the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more urgent.
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for a few decades.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long called for and what international agreements like the Anti-racism Convention Germany have to do, must become reality in the coming years, if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany has been able to provide the expected refugees medically, says medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"When it comes to man-power and capacity, we will create it," he said to the mirror of the day.
However, additional money has to be flown into the system.
In order to avoid pitfalls, Montgomery asks all arrivals to obtain health cards at the same time as registration.
The services provided could later be calculated with the German countries.
And in the long run, it would be most interesting to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of performances provided by the asylum competition law.
On the other hand, doctors are primarily responsible for creating language barriers.
Until now, as the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proved, migrants are worse informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practice, dolmetscher costs are to be taken over, she asks.
However, many refugees would have been helped with more general medical procedures in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people, it is HIV-declaration.
However, with the partly other disease images, German doctors come out of their training, Montgomery says.
"Parasite seizure or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as for the lack of a doctor, it is possible that even marginalisation is possible by refugees.
The acids had a highly developed education system, some refugees were even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, however, they had to demonstrate their qualifications and perhaps reject tests again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates of the Federal Psychotherapy Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress or depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee children, says Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recently published study of TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from so-called flashbacks with breathing, dizziness, heart beats, and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong fearlessness and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
To date, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although psychologically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can apply for psychotherapy, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, most professionals or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.
Many invite to dream
With the new "Leading" stage, the Circus Probst returns to the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw each age group into the bond of fascinating acrobatics, animal addresses and one-time entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites in the multitude on the brick water to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chief.
"Leading" - under this motto is the current manegenization.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift of enthusiasm is therefore in the blood of the family.
"It is important to take the people away from their daily struggle and take them to a completely different world for two hours," says 27-year-old junior chief.
"Manegen cocktail with World City-Flair," says Director Reinhard Probst.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 km long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family draws the audience with fun and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their work.
With the heroes of the stupid movies, it's going to take the Cuban duo off.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Their humorous art on the mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Except for numerous salmon salads, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with fingertips feeling and sensitivity.
Balance with the wheel on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
People with snakes fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinates with their mobility.
60 Employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," says Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Mistakes in the attitude of circuses are only too often the subject of various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes the position: "If it's not good for our animals, it's not good for us."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The "four-banded artists", as they are lovingly called, will be read out of the eyes as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to be in the range.
So the highest order: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhangst and a zebra stutte, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have been together for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the multitude, but it is the unique mask of the Circus Probst.
So there must be something for every visitor.
"One is safe," says Stephanie Probst, "whether five or 1,200 viewers, we always give our best and are with all our heart".
The Circus Probst invites you to his performances from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 a.m. every day.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 and 16 p.m.
Thursday is a family day, prices are reduced for the performance at 17:00.
In addition, the animal show is open every day from 10 to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds false speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case spread rapidly over the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also disturbed by the claims of the opposition's deputies that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's address with bullies.
Last month they had raised him up and interrupted him during his speech to the position of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the movement for democratic change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to disrupt Mr. Mugabe's address.
"The message comes from a number that will not be displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity will end in Parliament, and as soon as it leaves Parliament, its parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief spokesperson said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "anxious" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company's services.
HP will later be divided into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing company hardware and its services business.
The expected depreciation leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard-Enterprise," Meg Whitman, HP President and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than HP is today, and we have a wide and deeper portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better equipped than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion of annual revenue and "will be concentrated on providing unsatisfied, integrated technology solutions for companies so far," a statement by the company.
It splits up a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations and called their Palo Alto Garage "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone massive restructuring to manage the removal of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US technology companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on the conviction that a tight-focused company will achieve a better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind the wounded Jack Wilshere in front of the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed that it was only September and that if his rehabilitation went to plan, there was no reason why he could not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilsher will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and, in view of his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season after a separate knee injury and then returned to his old swing during the preseason.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that doesn't heal well.
That's no big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his bones or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the relative danger of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wilsher since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five games.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight games since 2007/08, which have the most days of injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil's circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Many times, when you get back from an injury, you have a sudden period, a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win the fighting force," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll run a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is putting in a rotation within the team.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not travelling to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wegener can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nago Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to take a little break," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to move on through Group F, the maximir stadium in Zagreb is one of the most frightening playgrounds in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeatable after 41 games after the "unavoidable" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shot by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the court scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has taken the lessons from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading his management to his first European pokal triumph.
"This drive is huge," said Wenger.
It's never hit Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I am long enough in the business to be realistic.
We're jealous, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up, now even more desperate than ever before, how suicides among young men prove at a 15-year-old height.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it remains three times more common for men than for women.
In an effort to address the problem, the campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a pitiful life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need it.
Friendship is the heartpiece in the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A current study of more than 2,000 high-school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "low mood", his chances of healing doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of spiritually healthy friends halfs the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you need to have friends just once so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on substance-style, the immediate response is often more important than an important contact.
Our digital lives have the need to appear, strong, lively and successful, doubled, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsical values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which affects our spiritual health much more deeply.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy luck.
The nice thing about friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments when playing football in cozy chairs and the passion of Ross to Rachel - all came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case, even if they often refrain from fully discovering their feelings.
As an employee of phone soul care told me: "My role in listening to people who are depressed and threatened with suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often don't feel able to talk to friends.
The old sentence "I come right with it" has an enormous effect, as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly."
Friends is one of the shows that makes sense to me when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
It presents clearly the small moments of men's friendships.
So much my objective foreign status over the phone can also help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend's Comedy Central FriendsFest with the completely redesigned scenes for the celebration of the day, why not take your friends with you to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or even better if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG destroy Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his encounter with Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to move to Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took a course when Paris Saint-Germain began his Champions League Season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Debüts than the PSG player who led the French masters on the way, but then they missed a series of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cavani achieved a headball in the 61th minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish masters, as they seek not only the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the fourth finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, there was no class game by Laurent Blancs Team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate. He was later replaced in the game against his home city team and against the association with which he started his illustrative career already in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or outside the Champions League. So it's a good start to win 2:0, to cause our opponents problems and to relax, even if there are certain things that we still need to perfect during the season," Blanc said.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have not reached one or two more doors."
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which on the weekend could keep a 2:2 undecided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was kicked out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine bird storm was referred to as the man who can take the PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United, and he pointed out why when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before passing by Johan Wiland into the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would win a big victory that was disappointed.
Malmö, who hit Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, attacked Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep into the middle field a heavy opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far on Kevin Trapps Pfosten in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, the PSG itself sometimes came up with some flaws and bad conclusions, not least from Ibrahimovic, who was put to death in the first half of the five trials alone and then given up after Cavani had used it after restarting it.
Nevertheless, he proved much more fit when he brought his fellows into the game, and it was a pass of Ibrahimovic, whom Di Maria turned into a turnout, which was spent by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the foot ...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour-mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan achieved its sixth seasoner after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flag of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the result low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was removed a door at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later added that the PSG played a class on his team, and Norway said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which has not the same level.
Qualification games are not enough."
Get out of Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The mining giant Glencore located in Switzerland, which is affected by rising raw materials prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt recovery plan.
Glencore, registered in London, stated in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is fighting falling raw materials prices, as China's economic downturn pushes demand and distorts itself on markets.
The issue of rights of reference brought Glencore's stock exchange rate to the top of the London Stock Exchange in the early middle of the morning.
The share jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore last week had announced the 2.5 billion share sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to spend around one third of his 30 billion dollars on debt.
The company sold the new stakes to 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the final course on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares in the amount of up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term hidden growth in China have reduced iron prices by about half, coal, copper and other raw materials prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees in Weimar

The White House Confirms Xi Jinpings Visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis first official in Washington, takes place on September 25th and refers President Barack Obamas' trip to Beijing last November, the state said.
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also be guests of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner after the two state leaders have held bilateral talks this evening.
"President Xis' visit will offer the opportunity to expand US-China cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, but also President Obama and President Xi will also give the opportunity to address constructively areas of disagreements," the state added.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders on his way to Washington before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns regarding alleged cyber spying in China and its increasing self-consciousness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 Change to FC Bayern
World and European Master Xavi has been playing since summer 2015 for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar
The FC Bayern was apparently just a few years ago before the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times Pocal winner, four times Champions League winner, two-time club world champions, two-time European champions, one-time world champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now betrays that he was already in front of the EM in 2008 before the departure from Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at the time, we won nothing," he says.
And that's what the FC Bayern recorded.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummengge wanted me."
To remember: In summer 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi didn't change
But the change didn't stop.
And the successful man is working for the German recordmaker Pep Guardiola today.
Xavi explains why: "Barça took Guardiola under contract and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's what he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's playtime 2008/2009 would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca at the fourth final of the Champions League against the Bayers over the entire distance on the race, switched off the Reds (4:0, 1:1) and finally celebrated the Royal Class Triumph.
Matt Damon plays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted the African American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said that she would not be needed behind the scenes.
During a follow-up of Sunday night by HBOs Project Greenlight interrupted the experienced actor Brown, as she stressed the need for alternative perspectives, in relation to a black protagonist in the selected spinbook of the project.
"If we talk about diversity, then you do it when the film is filmed and not when the show is done," said Damon.
Brown reacted shockingly, with policing disbelief and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the comments of The Martian's actor stood firm.
Damon and Brown joined Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the figure of the harmony," Brown said first.
The only black person, and she's a utility that's hit by her white container.
The producer of Dear White People set up for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the director's rights in the film; Damon pointed out that their director could "give us at the end of what we don't want."
After the discussion was released, the social media exploded before misconception about Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts".
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 Likes since its publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when the right racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After the young man Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved national effect and forced legislators and authorities to offer discriminatory practices against colouring content.
In February, the singer Prince made an announcement on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", (Albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
In recent times, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement, and in response to the question of the Fox-News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be viewed as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a group of lovers," said the leaders.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media Moguls who will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior" won the first champion
Profi sports climber and operating aid Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the big price of $1 million with home.
The competition show, which just completed its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season's finals, there were two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, until the finals.
The last task was to climb on a 75 foot long climbing line in 30 seconds.
Britain completed the task within the time when he was the first athlete to complete the exciting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero ended this challenge three seconds faster than he did to win.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard win, still under shock over the profits of the Great Price of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," Isaac E! said about his capital money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how that's... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to complete the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finalist, it gets him with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, it gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's talking about any of this.
He's just as happy to have done what he's done.
Lots of awards he received from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had changed their roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eight staff, the rotating work will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers fight in Minnesota Twins past
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They were once one of the best teams in baseball, today the tigers are in the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers were reduced as a spy, but on Tuesday, this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the target field.
The Twins lost a chance to get up within half of Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard Square.
For Detroit, although only for one evening, it was a return of the three letters F-word, which was so difficult to capture over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitch Alfredo Simon stood up for his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) struck 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine parties.
"I want to end this year strongly," said Simon.
It's hard to throw every game in the bubble, and that's why I want to go very focused into the game.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-shooting game since he had four hits against the Seattle Marines on July 6.
"He slammed the wood well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at the (schlagttraining), looked significantly better at the bullpen, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three rounds in the background meeting at the end of the seventh inning, the twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Field Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left line.
Right Field Aaron Hicks reached a well, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before he was replaced by the left-hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived Mauer, the only man with whom he was confronted, before the appointed Rookie-Schlagmann Miguel Sano, who gave the right hand Drew a two-run entriss.
With a couple of runners and the final run at the second round, the third baseman Trevor Plouffe brought the third one to a double play.
It was the leader of Major League 27 times in this season that Ploughs hit a double game
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Mauer created an RBI double against the tiger's shutters Bruce Rondon and achieved the status of 5-4.
However, the right-hand Sano stood out at three Pitches for his fifth Save.
Detroit benefited from a still unmoved Phil Hughes to launch the game.
The tigers achieved three runs in the first two innings against the right-hand veteran, who had been cut off before the game of the injured list after he had been missing for more than a month due to a rear lead.
"Of course not the beginning that I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt better when I released and felt that I would create some pretty good Pitches there in the third inning."
After they first received the Leadoff battery, Hushes gave up a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, which created a single "up the middle" during the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the score position.
The third Basseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third, which ended the threat.
The tigers added in the second, a One-Out Double of Catcher James McCann and a Two-Out Single of Center-Field Anthony Gose achieved 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't do very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a Pitch-count, not reaching points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reliable Right Hand A.J. Later.
At Hughes it came to three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTE: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was separated because of an injury to the projector.
He is being investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list due to a shoulder disorder, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris will be removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30th.
He has been missing since 20 August due to a collapse in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and Twins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to live in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people involved there will then be held in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden reported on Tuesday evening.
It counted with 450 to 750 arriving refugees.
Several sportsmen from the Hessian capital were prepared for this case in the past days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can stay temporarily there.
They should then be further distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, 7500 people in Hessen arrived at the government office responsible for the first reception.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in Sportallen because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military action with German participation in Syria an opportunity.
"I think the determined thought about military action options cannot take place without Germany," he said.
He proposed "collective reflections" to the European States.
Four years ago, it was a joy to see the Kalch pass through a military involvement in Germany.
"Now the conflict lands in front of our door," he said in the German radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on site for refugees.
Austria controlled at the southern and eastern borders
According to Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF, no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has also sent no refugees back to Austria.
"No, it's so agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement after which Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said it had already been discussed between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
Specific figures did not call it and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria through the so-called Balkan route.
Its goal is mainly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, applied for a special summit next week.
Germany had started temporary border checks on Sunday.
The EU countries have so far not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
On the next Tuesday (September 22nd), EU Interior Ministers want to take a new call for the mandatory distribution of more than 120 000 refugees at a special meeting.
In view of the strong refugee campaign in Germany, the federation wants to support the countries in the first phase of the recruitment and distribution of people.
The fed will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced on the late Tuesday after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister at the Berlin Office.
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection also fight these.
However, those who do not have a living perspective cannot stay in Germany either.
This opinion was expressly shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to deal with a "great effort".
Thousands of dubious refugees are currently on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175 km long border to Serbia in the night of Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government announced in Budapest that the border to Romania would be cut off with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU other than Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent Schlepper from looking for routes across Romania, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto to the planned new border zone.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, according to eyewitness reports, thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds Ocean on Saturn Mond Enceladus
Under the icepaner of the Saturn Mond Enceladus, a global ocean is blowing.
This concludes researchers from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
Then the moon slowly dives on its path around the ring planets.
Although this thumb movement is only small, yet too large for a constantly fixed body of heaven, it is called in a message from the Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, from Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the "Icarus" section.
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice deck of Enceladus.
Thus "Cassini" had already discovered 2006 ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn, feeding the water vapour and ice particles and thus feeding the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least in the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers close at that time.
However, the extension of the hidden ocean was not explained.
Rama is missing 1860 Munich for several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to leave around a month on the offensive factor Valdet Rama.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury at the age of 27, the association informed.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to München Löwen, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of forced rest".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a sheer loss."
"Of course we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "image" section with a view to the possible obligation of an unifying profession.
As a training guest, however, the 60s first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
Croatia currently has "the opportunity to demonstrate its ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his brain injury.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is scheduled to join the training.
Okotie had injured herself in the party at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) during a severe head crash.
In contrast to the first fears, however, he remained without a heavy blessing.
No Diet Fruit - Mangos contains much sugar
Mangos are exotic and sweet.
But those who want to follow his slender line will often be taken away from them.
Because mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits, however, are healthy: they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. However, Mangos contain much vitamin A and its pre-stage beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruit thus support visual, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, Mangos should not be too soft or stiff and pleasant to smell.
The shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangos can taste very delicious as well.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within less days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or sweet food.
A mango, however, also gives a special note to sincere judges.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits fish, birds, lamb and wild.
The U.S. Package Service again introduces up to 95,000 aid for the Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS informed on Tuesday.
In particular, drivers were sought.
As of last year, UPS had suspended its crew for the holiday season by 95,000 aid.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its rival FedEx have met earlier arrangements to be armed for the Christmas business since last year.
Late deliveries in 2013 had introduced the package services hard criticism.
First firestorm, then a marked cold front
In the coming night, the valley of the Alpennorth side of the Föhn breaks through, as Meteoshweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and at night on Thursday, the Föhn is partially blown by the Föhntellers.
After the morning of Thursday morning, we are surrounded by a spectacular cold front, which brings powerful rainfalls, winds and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a message, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive underground area over the British islands in a strong south-west stream.
On the alpine north side, the valley breaks through the valleys in the night for the middle of the night.
As a result, the Föhn will blow up to Thursday morning in the Föhntälers with bends from 60 to 100 km/h, alone and in particular in the Urnerland, with more than 100 km/h.
In fact, the fungus can go up to the neighbouring Mediterranean, and even on the mountains are possible hurricanes of more than 120 km/h.
While in the north on the Wednesday of the stormy oven for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, moisture begins to grow on the alpensüdhang.
Here is a set of rains that last until Thursday evening.
In total, the Alps have to be calculated in the next 48 hours with a partial rain of over 100 litres per square meter, after which large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the air runs out to the fans, resulting in a cold front with a strong, partial, vicious rain from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind cools strongly until stormy, and the temperatures go back clearly.
The following days are presented in the north by 15 to 20 degrees in the east, but in the south it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees in the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the reform, there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, on Wednesday, a nameless place in the park on the oppio hill was baptized on behalf of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Luthero" he is now considered a "German Theology of Reform".
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The appointment was requested by the working community of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the popes over the centuries could often live as a minority only in the hidden faith.
The place will symbolically show that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) held himself as a young Augustiner monk for the 1510/11 season in Rome for a few months.
He received the city at the time as a condemned sinner.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome in the eyes of historians.
Luther had then begun the division of the evening church with his thesis against the waste trade.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown is one of the main works Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At first, was it the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which now appeared with magnificent images.
At first, the picture was for Otmar Old, who in 150 motives formulated his entire personal interpretation of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and fantastic shapes has been received by the 75-year-old - but it doesn't matter in any way with "listening" pictures.
On the contrary: the subject is adapted, it can be quite dark.
About three years ago, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he met a subjective-artistic selection from the many topics of the "Book of All Books".
Cyclings have been created that dedicate themselves to topics such as crossroads, plagues, commandments or fathers' grandsons.
As a result, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publishing with his theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing with his focus on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost, who, on the basis of the painting, has intertwined with the respective Bible sites.
He interpreted the Bible sites chosen by Otmar Alt and thus translated into today, in current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible dating from Martin Luther and each of them a set of artists, who here formulates his very personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry belt has gold letters.
Thus the 75-year-old alike doubles a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Finally, emotions were triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant order of the Lord.
"The education was done with the pipestock," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work this out, so that perhaps I may be able to reinstate myself with the Lord Father."
His second concern was to help art in a time of rapid recovery: "The perception of image worlds is marked today by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is being forced there.
Artists have another desire and affection to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "influenza" into the images, let them affect themselves, discover and sense what power they have: "The image is looking for its opposite."
Klaus Altepost was present on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "always" a lover of Otmar's old art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Old people did not pay attention to fully grasping the Bible, but they chose important, even mysterious, subjects for it.
"This was not cooperation on eye height," says Altepost, "this is about the images that the text explains only".
For Hans Möhler from Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "invigorate his life and find freedom".
Otmar All pictures speak for Möhler both the (bible) language of love and the responsibility.
Part of the original - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened at the Otmar-Alt Foundation on 15 November.
Construction start for BMX-Bahn near
Plans made, space found, company commissioned, trailer modeled for a round course: One year later, almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX train was finished again.
There was a lack of policy and administration, especially for the residents who did not want to take the train.
So the hills fell, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for construction approval.
In October, the first municipal agency, Sabine Mosbach-Bock, was able to report to the Committee on Children and Youth.
"I hope this year is still visible," she said.
It should then be started without "longer memory break" with the work of the former hall bathroom.
DFB intensifys engagement for refugees
The DFB expresses its commitment to refugees by 2019, the Bundesliga sets a clear sign on the weekend.
The football reacts to the situation in Germany and the politics ensures its help in dealing with the emerging problems.
"I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since the reunification."
"No one in principle can say that I have nothing to do with it."
"This must interest everyone in getting this issue into the grip," said DFB Chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I am in the office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs Özoğuz and the Chancellor there."
"Then the topic will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football can and wants to help.
But the decisive differences must be the policy.
The Deutsche Football-Bund has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" for four years.
"On the Egidius Brown Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," Niersbach explained at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some of the federalists also support this programme.
Already on this weekend, the 36 professionals show a clear sign when they are wearing the impression "We're helping - #refugeeswelcome" on the left triangle instead of the other usual sponsor logo (hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how only they can," said Leverkusen sportsman Rudi Völler of the "image" section (sunday) and described the project as "self-understanding".
"The refugee drama is about everyone, no one can see away."
"We can, no, we need to use our radiation power, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoppenheim's Managing Director Peter Justig spoke of a "prominent sign of the League".
For the EM qualification game against Hungary this Friday, the women's national team invites 100 refugees to Hall/Saale.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as "a large community of German football".
That all 36 licensing associations have started their own projects in their places, be great.
It is equally great that small and smaller associations are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have issued, is live in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
This year and next year, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide EUR 300,000 each for the integration of refugees.
"The associations have also called the whole amount for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in accident
The head of the Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, has lost his left eye, according to several reports by a storm in early July.
In the case of the accident at his brother's house in the United States, he fell on a glass of water that he had carried in his left hand after midnight, the "Employment Week" reported on Wednesday.
"He's almost fainted, he was powerless, then he slipped out on the street - that's what he told us last week," says the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could follow his work.
"In early October we will meet before the Supervisory Council meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager is at the meeting and "full-time".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutschen Zeitung" (Süddeutschen Zeitung), he will come back to Germany in October and lead the software groups further.
"I'm full of SAP there, full of my job."
"Of course, I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its President Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually lives between Germany and the USA, but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP centre in Walldorf.
It is important for him to go with such a personal story to the public, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Everyone can do something like this."
"It's important to stand up again when you fall down."
McLaren rescue pilot Magnussen except for combat ...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he was injured by the wheel.
As a result, at the end of the week, he comes in Singapore as little as a reserve leader for the two family soldiers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as a week later at the Great Price of Japan.
Football: BVB without giants against Krasnodar: Weidenfelder in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus have finally collapsed in the first group game of Europe League.
The national player will also miss the table leader of the football-Bundesliga in duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00/Sky).
"We can't take it back," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be on Sunday in the Federal league game against Leverkusen again, the BVB coach opened: "We expect him to return to training on Friday".
Given the high load of his profession, Tuchel will not only change his strain on the giant position.
That's how he announced a change in the torso position.
This is why Roman Weidenfelder takes the place of the Roman Bürki tribekeeper.
"He trains on an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, if weidenfields are to be used in all European League games in the future, Tuchel opened up.
He will likely also fight the second party.
The research statement by Co-player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in Europe League must be the goal, says middle-field player Julian Weigl: "This is not so wrong with Marco."
"I think we have a good chance of taking the title."
Robotic cars: Government wants to advance the role of Germany
Germany is expected to be technologically ahead when changing the car after the will of the Federal Government.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA car fair from a "new mobility season".
The automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less noise," said Dobrandt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport's strategy paper highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband development and a rapid rise in digital radio.
In order to test new technology, a test line is currently in place on motorway 9 in Bavaria.
In order to ensure that the driver is "no additional liability risks", the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework conditions and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
Thus, Germany intends to make use of the international to increase the permissible maximum speed for self-propelled cars from 10 to 130 kilometres.
In addition, the Federal Government wants to make use of a change in the Vienna Convention, which has so far been intended only for people as a driver.
In the case of automated driving, the car will increasingly take over the driving, and the driver will be more and more on the passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds.
After a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, high-automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, roadless vehicles on public roads are "to be expected long after 2020".
The value added in the field of driver support systems and high-automated driving functions at the location of Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital network of the Pkws can lead to more security and efficiency in road transport," said SPD Transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the driver's personal data should be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans see self-driving cars skeptically - much more than French or American.
A survey carried out on Wednesday at the AA by the Forsa Institute, on behalf of the Dekra Audit Organisation, results that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be carried out in the next ten years, 32 percent only in 20 years so that 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 per cent of the respondents count up to 2025 with autonomous driving cars, in the USA 33 per cent.
Nevertheless, the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave completely on a self-driving vehicle.
After a survey of the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire journey on all roads.
On the highway, however, this could be represented by 15 percent in the current traffic, 45 percent in the stau.
Well, every quarter would leave control to the car under no circumstances.
Boll says team and double start at table tennis EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to take up the title battles from 25 September to 4 October only in detail.
The final decision shall take place at the latest on 22 September.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys have learned it in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsoring term in China at that time.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to be back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite," said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who runs the set list in Jekaterinburg, also recalled the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"Then Timo also failed, and we have become European champions."
"We should be guided by Daran," explained the World rankings of five.
The English football national player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg.
At the Champions League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defender was met at a hostage by Héctor Moreno and was replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis showed a break in the 20-year-old player from Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a growing-figure grueling cabinet: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The high points: Shoe-drops, which thanks to video projections look scary human.
They bring the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things with Madonna's stage outfits, became the great star of fashion - and that he put men in a dress.
"I can't say today that I'm the child terrible of the skin couture because I have white hair."
"In the past it was obvious, in the meantime it is true," said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (from the citizens' ladder on the path), which is to be seen in the art hall of the Hypo-Cultural Foundation of 18 September, it is a lucky thing for fashion designers to change his attitude to a show about his person at first.
On the contrary, he said, "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already taken place in Canada's Montreal and Paris station.
"It's so much more than beautiful clothes," said the director of the Art Hall, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the man's hardly yet transparent work, which the fashion story has written without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographical art for which much effort has been made: for example, a stylist has been engaged to refresh the buds.
14 tonnes of material have been photographed by the makers according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the October festival, there was another special charmer: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women (“Women are harsher than men”) and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy is also seen at the exhibition.
It stands for the first, cunning fashioning attempts of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad at football) he wore his Teddy BHs and clothes, Gaultier said.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
The design of fashion he later joined himself.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, though, I bought it, of course.
For his first fashion show he couldn't pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they couldn't keep the mounts.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener tipze as fashion niche
Earlier it went to the long stick machines and to blow it up to make meters.
The glued materials and tips were produced in large quantities for customers who, for example, were further processed into blankets and gardenes.
This alone is no longer working today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Plauen Fashionspitze.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze mode played a greater role, then was forced by the home textile industry - and is now re-discovered as a niche.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: tops in jewelry, at accessories such as bags and in regional suits.
In general, the so-called Vintage mode, which lends itself to past style pockets, is an increasing contract potential.
Those who do not operate in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they're already doing half of all the orders.
Fashionspitze Plauen is a member of the Plauener Spitze industry association with nine other companies.
Only they can wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of the turnover has been lost.
There are almost no private trades and also wholesale trade.
Our products barely reach the customer in this way.
The mass equipment is now much cheaper in the Asian space and almost exclusively distributed through chains.
In addition, exports, currently to Russia and the United States, are weakened.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to point out by environmental awareness how Cordula Bauer from the stick pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have been leading a quality seal that shows that we are producing environmentally and socially sustainable".
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Outpost of the Western University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in stickers and tips.
In order to counteract competition from the Asian space, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and the companies that have to think economically,” says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design will often vary slightly just to keep a customer strain.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter relived the historic snowball peaks.
The machine sticks small balls in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallbach-Kruße was inspired by this: "Before, I couldn't start anything with traditional Plauener tipze".
Now she's using the snowball tip for her beauty.
In an intense process, she marks the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuters.
It also delivers to the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose backgrounds have lived in the plauen and the surrounding area and who want a piece of memory.
That's why I see my beauty as a modern messenger of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney planted a new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends should not be touched, but Disney is still looking forward to a new film by his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, it's not about a new filming, it's about a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first movie with the magic girl.
It is about the experiences of Nanny and the family Banks in times of the global economic crisis in England.
Whoever plays Poppins for more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already standing: Rob Marshall, last time with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi insists to open the economy wider for the world
The economy needs to open up further outside to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday, a group that was commissioned to drive the reform.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and to improving business-based strategies," he said in an address at the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
To promote new foundations and to advance reforms will lead to new momentum and vitality and will provide a new place for economic growth," Xi said.
The Steering Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access arrangements, the relaxation of border control policies, the promotion of state enterprises (SOEs), private capital, and the resumption of the population reporting system.
After the status, a negative list is created identifying sectors and companies that are not in question for investments.
The system is tested after and after and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important as it plays a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market, ensures a legal environment and opens up the market, the state said.
The government will also lose control of the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The state also said that China will be allowed to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open State-controlled sectors, further areas of private investment will be opened.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the state said.
Furthermore, it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to ensure that their activities are carried out and that professional judges and public prosecutors are employed was also discussed at a meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also took part in the meeting, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit value in raw fish
The European Commission wants to double the thresholds for mercury in large ruminant fish and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve poison.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, criticised the plans with strong criticism: "The risks and adverse effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are further exposed with full caution to pregnant and small children," explains Matthias Wolfschmidt von Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily charged with mercury today that, on the basis of the existing limits, about 50 percent of the catches cannot be sold.
After double the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsold.
On the contrary, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to increase the limits for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, referred to this as "Trick", because smaller fish, such as carpfs, are usually so low that they already respect the planned maximum levels.
The decoupling of small fish is therefore "a perfect decoupling manover that helps the economy alone," Wolfschmidt explained.
Quecksilber is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched by the food chain, especially in raw fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "some small amounts can cause particularly unborn damage to the nervous system".
The Federal Ministry of the Environment, however, states on its homepage that there is no "health risk of the general population".
Qucksilber is mainly due to coal combustion in the environment.
According to a written statement by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal plants are at the disposal of the Greens-Bundagrägs-Aggent Annana Baerbock, more than six tonnes of mercury per year, two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, Rhein and Donau, was "exceeded permanently and permanently", the "peak" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, European warnings against mercury in fish included the most frequently reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
