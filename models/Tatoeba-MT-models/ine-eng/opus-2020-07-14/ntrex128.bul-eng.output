The members of the Wells Assembly are concerned that “they look like fools ”
Part of the members of the Assembly are mocked by the proposal to change their name to "CPU" (member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was prompted by plans to change the name of the Assembly of the "Parliament of Wales".
Members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this could be a cause for laughter.
One of the liberators said that his group was concerned that the new name was "brought with Tup and Wdlub."
For readers outside Wells: In Wellski it certainly matters.
According to one of the members of the Plaid party, the whole group "is not happy" and offered alternatives.
The representative of the Welsh Conservative Party pointed out that his group "has not been persuaded" to change the name, but notes that the new name CWP (MWP) has a certain verbal opportunity with "muppet".
In this context, the English word "W" is similar to the English word "U".
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drawing up the draft law to change the name, made the following statement: 'The final decision on all descriptive names to which the members of the Assembly are called shall be of the members themselves'.
The Wells Government Act of 2017 gave the Wells Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry on the proposals by which broad support was established for the Assembly to start calling the Parliament of Wells.
As far as the duties of its members are concerned, the Commission prefers "member of the Parliament of Wells, a short "CPU", but the "CPU" option has received the greatest support after an inquiry into society.
Members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching a consensus will obviously be a headache for President Elin Jones, from which the draft bill is expected to be black for change up to a few weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes in the way the Assembly works, i.e. rules on the disqualification of its members, as well as the design of the Commission system itself.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on how they will be called when they reach the draft resolution.
Macedonians will vote on a referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is planned to resolve the ongoing ten-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has an administrative area called "Macedonia".
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to the Greek state territory, and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on changing the name of the country, has stated that you will not see the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in the name of the country is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells shut down in the background of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today both are gone."
Adams says the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"Today's times are socialized in different ways," he adds.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhoods every day, where everyone gathers regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not reach as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be in the same situation".
The man adds that the churches can be replaced by blocks with apartments, where people live who don't help survive the rest of the neighborhood sanctuary.
"The vast majority of people who buy houses in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new residents will visit them."
Both churches were built by white roads before Harlem became a neighborhood of blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's decade later.
The initial White Methodist Passage took place in the years after 1930.
After that, the building became owned by black neighborhoods.
"St. Martin" was a poet by the black Christians under the leadership of the former John Howard Johnson, who organized the fight against the retailers on the 125th street, which is the main market street in Harlem, as they did not want to hire black officials.
In 1939, the building suffered severe fire damage, but Father Johnson's nuns made a plan for her restoration, where the bells were ordered.
The famous David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, and the heir to St. Martin, proudly called them the "poor bells".
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: "Cultural treasure" and "unchangeable historical instrument".
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first system of bells in the world that was used by a black musician – Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger system in the church "Riverside" 18 years ago.
Mr. Merioeder mentioned that St. Martin had not been replaced.
What has been played in St. Martin over the past few weeks has been a complex story of architects and performers, some brought by the world leaders of the church, and others by the bishops.
From the winner – which is the leading body of the poet, consisting of world leaders – they wrote to the parish in July, expressing their concern that the parish “would be inclined to transfer the costs of the firm”, even though it did not have a role in the hiring of architects and performers sent by the parish.
Some nuns have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the parish.
13-year-old child injured by a shark in a lobster hunt in California
The shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy last Saturday, while it drowned for lobsters in California in the first day of the hunting season, representatives reported.
The attack happened just 7 mornings ago near the Bikan beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel shared in front of the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he drowned with friends about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and he walked in with the whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamel first thought that the child had become tired and excited, and then he realized how he cried out: “Hope me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he got to the boy, he realized that the entire area of his key was broken.
"I called everyone out of the water because there's a shark!" he adds.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the children's "Radi" hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to critical condition.
It's still not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Gills reported to the media briefing that a few weeks earlier in the water was a marked shark, but it was estimated not to be a dangerous species.
Gilles adds that the victim has suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of his body.
The responsible authorities closed access to the beach line Ponto in Kazablad to Suomi in Ensitinas for 48 hours from safety considerations while the investigation was ongoing.
Gilles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which, however, do not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury plans an offensive on the UK wholesale market for decorative products
Sainsbury stands against Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, opening standards for decorative products in their facilities, where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the market for decorative products in Britain, which is estimated to be 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while the sales of fashion and domestic products decrease, the largest retailers will be placed in 11 shops across the country, after which, in the success of such an initiative, they will be found in more objects.
The investment in the decoration industry is taking place at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the furniture, recently occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
From Sainsbury, they said they would double the number of the products offered up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, like the offers in Boots stores.
The supermarket also re-launchs its bottle range of mushrooms, so most products can be used by veganzas – something that is increasingly sought for by younger users.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will try discount programs at two Sainsbury shops, the first of which he opened in Croedon, South London last week, while the second one will be found in Selie Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and shifting focus on the marketing of smaller quantities of food daily at comfortable times leads to the need for supermarkets to make more efforts to attract buyers.
Mike Koup, Chief Executive Director of Sainsbury, shared that the facilities would look more and more like universal stores, while the chain of supermarkets is trying to deal with Aldi and Lidl discounters, offering more services and non-food.
Sainsbury has Argos's facilities in hundreds of stores, as well as Habitats's facilities since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims has increased food sales and made the profits even more profitable.
The previous attempt by the chain of supermarkets to preface its facilities for decorative and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury had a joint experience with Boots in the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute to distribute profits from the pharmaceutical company's facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 Celesio's site, which is owned by Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim that Lloyds will play a role in the plan, providing the rich range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hex, trade director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: “We have transformed the nature and nature of our decorating stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We also invested in special training for our colleagues who would offer professional advice on the spot.
The range of brands proposed by us aims to respond to every taste and all necessary in a pleasant location in a prisoner environment, making us an attractive destination for decorative products, which creates a challenge to the very concept of the old way of marketing."
Peter Jones "slow" after Holly Wilby's cancellation of a 11 million-pound deal
The star of Dragons Den Peter Jones "has become embroiled", after TV leader Holly Wilby has turned down a deal for 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Wilby doesn't have time for the brand home appliances and accessories True.
The couple's business is compared to the Goop brand of Guinet Poltrow.
The 37-year-old leader of "This morning" announced his resignation in Instagram.
Holly Willubi left the star from Dragons Den Peter Jones "to buy", after getting rid of their business with the brand for the last minute – in order to focus on its own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones "became angry" when the "gold girl" on TV admitted during the tense meeting on Tuesday at the centre of his business empire in Marlow, Buckingamshire, that its new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds, mean that there will be no longer time for his brand household products and accessories True.
The business is about the Goop brand of Guinet Poltrow, as the rumors are that he doubled Willubi's wealth, whose value is projected at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Wilby announced in Instagram his abandonment of True, Jones left Britain with a plane to go to one of his holiday properties.
One of the sources said: "Truly was definitely Holly's highest priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to secure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave the matter completely unplanned.
No one believed that this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse in Marlowe that's full of waiting for products to be sold."
Experts believe that the removal of the leading 'This morning', which is one of the most successful stars in Britain, could cost the company millions because of the large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, as well as could lead to a slowdown in the launch of the market.
And not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Wilby, whose mother of three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willubi himself founded True with Cap in 2016, as Jones, who was 52, joined the company as president in March.
Both families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willubi will become an "messenger" of the brand for M&S and will also replace Ann McCarlin as the lead of the broadcast "I am famous" on ITV.
A source that is close to Jones last night made the following statement: "We do not comment on his business".
Serious negotiations leading to 'relationship'
He boasts about the criticisms he would bring from the press channels for making a comment, which someone would consider as "inappropriate to the President" and as too positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump retreat so much?
Thrupp responded in his hot "new" way.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first in Singapore in June and was announced by Trump as "a major step towards removing the nuclear weapon of North Korea".
But negotiations to eliminate this weapon are in place.
More than three months after the youth meeting in Singapore, North Korea's diplomat Ri Young Ho told the representatives of the UN General Assembly that North Korea "does not see reciprocity" by the US towards the country's first steps on the way to disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining the tension.
Trump introduced a much more optimistic view of things in his speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he noted.
"We were on our way to war with this country.
Millions of people would be killed.
Instead, we now enjoy wonderful relationships."
The president said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results – the cessation of rocket tests, the release of hostages and the return of US troops to the home.
He also defended his non-orthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's extremely easy to act like president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded area, we'd have about 200 people right there," Trump said, squeezing the crowd in front of him.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and lead to hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were declared unnecessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, a national disaster was not announced, which is a requirement for initiating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases there is a clear opinion that there is no need for international aid, which makes things slightly challenging," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While "Save the Children" is a team to go to Palu, it is still not certain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate in the country.
The national speaker of the disaster agency Mr. Sutopo announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palo to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
In view of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains so unprepared for this kind of natural disaster.
Although there were shelters in Aceh in the case of tsunamis, they were not often seen on the other shores.
The obvious lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was given.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the majority of Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more complicated.
Previously stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake, the hospital ship has headed to Palu, but it will be at least three days before he can reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Weidodo has turned Indonesia's remaining infrastructure into the centre of his election campaign by investing a large amount of funds in roads and railway lines.
But the lack of funding is constantly blocking his office, while Joko is relaunching the riots next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with swords, bows, and arrows, as well as other original weapons.
See: Daniel Stridge brought late equality for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing the High League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute this Saturday of the Stanford Bridge in London.
Stridge got a shipment from Jordan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door, while his team stayed with 1-0.
He set the ball on his left foot, then sent a precise shot to the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penal field and directed to the top right corner of the network.
She's transferred the planetary Cape Arisabalag and she's going to land in the net.
"I wanted to take a good position to control the ball, because players like Shak are always looking for inputs in front positions, so I was just trying to win as much time as possible for a good shot at the door," Sterije told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I've seen Kante turn, I've pushed my ball, and I've just shot myself without much to think about."
Chelsea took 1-0 in the 25th minute after the goal of his Belgian star One Azar.
The attacker of the "sins" handed fifth to Mateo Kovacic, then printed from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
A coward exchanged fast double delivery to the center.
Then he released a quick shot dog with which he took Azar to a clean position in the field of punishment.
Azar ran over the defenders and noticed with his left foot in the far corner next to the door of Liverpool Alison Baker.
Liverpool will face Napoleon at the group stage of the Championship League at 15:00 this Wednesday at the stadium "San Paolo" in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton in the League of Europe of WEFA at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Number of deaths from tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths following the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of the buildings, met after the earthquake with a magnitude 7.5, which struck the country on Friday and led to waves of up to 20 feet high, reports the press conference's speaker of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 people, has been damaged by debris.
Police arrest a man 32 years of suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been initiated, after the woman's body was discovered this morning in Berkenhead.
The remains of the 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 in the morning with wounds from the arrest of Grayson Mouse of John Street, as a 32-year-old man was allegedly arrested for murder.
The police are asking for assistance from all the areas they've seen or heard.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan made the following statement: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I beg all who were close to John Street in Berkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious, to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with their desk cameras, to contact us, as it is possible to have vital information for the investigation."
Police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body is open is Berkenhed's resident and found in private property.
This afternoon a group of friends who consider the woman to be known have arrived at the place and asked where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues as the police report informs the victim's relatives at the moment.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mouse tried to get home to his apartment, but he was informed by the police that no one was allowed to come in or out of the building.
The man remained silent when he realized what had happened.
The residents have been told that they will be allowed to go home for hours.
One of the police officers reported to a man that the whole area was treated as a crime scene.
A grieving woman appeared on the scene.
She continues to repeat, "It's so horrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon two police baths passed through the border while another van was out.
There are police officers in the border watching the housing block.
All available information is requested to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, code 247 on 30 September.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue turns into the latest memory hit by "rewrite the story"
Its ban will be poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts that have been carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But "The Society of Cromwell" described Mr. Creek's proposal as "bezumium" and "expert on rewriting the story".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in this debate to remove the statues of Oliver Cromwell to the palace of Westminster.
The economics of English civil wars were neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be turned into a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the past century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornichraft is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the story of a figure that many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromuel is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, of course in his case this is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which has shaped our nation's subsequent development, and Cromuel is a clearly recognizable person who represents one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve recognition and honor."
A prose-killer wounded a deadly Chinese farmer
Farmer was attacked and killed by a pig market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his name as Yuan, was found dead with the broken artery and covered in blood near the market corner of Leupanshui in Guajou province, reported on Sunday South China Morning Post.
The pigs were prepared to inject their pigs with vaccines on 30 May 2005 in Sinin from the Province of Cinhai, China.
He was supposed to arrive with his cousin from the neighboring province of Greece on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
On the next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also locked the door to the next horse open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig in the cart with a murky walnut.
The forensic expert confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked a deadly farmer, reports the report.
"My cousin's step was obliterated and deformed," said cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The footage from the security camera shows how Juan goes to the market at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pig.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The murderer did not belong to John or his cousin.
The market manager reported to Evening News that the pig was locked up so that he could not attack anyone else while the police collect evidence from the crime scene.
It has also been reported that the Yuan family and the management of the market are negotiating a benefit for the death case.
Although they're rare, it's been reported before about the pigs that attack people.
In 2016 the pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and after the attack, the man was severely injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig put a Welsh farmer in his tractor while his wife managed to hunt him down.
After an oregano farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "slip".
"They're just playing.
The pigs are like little children, extremely curious... they're not meant to hurt anyone.
But a man also has to treat them with respect," the man ends.
The weakening hurricane of Rosa will bring to honor and flood rains in the southwestern United States
According to weather forecast, hurricane Rosa loses its weight as it moves over the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, during the next days, Rosa will lead to flooding rains in northern Mexico and south-western United States.
Rosa includes winds of 85 miles per hour, which is hurricane of category 1, considered to be 5 hours a week in the morning east time and is located 385 miles south-west of Punta Evgenia, Mexico.
She's expected to move north during the week.
During this time, over the Pacific, a cyclone that moves east to the west coast of the United States begins to form. While Rosa approaches the peninsula Baha California on Monday as a tropical storm, she will start to push the tropical wave deep into the north to the south-west part of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will lead to 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Within the next few days, the tropical impact along with the approaching cycle will create frequent heavy rains in the south-west.
At local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, torrential fractures, and likely falls in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to waves of 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the south-west there are expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially above most of Arizona.
It is possible to have light floods in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unreasonable to travel a hat in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rains.
The heavy rain can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and the thunderstorms will lead to high dust and wind.
The approaching cycle will lead to heavy rains in some parts on the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach a raft of over half an inch, which will lead to carrying small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainy season wave.
In the late week and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area in the late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the four corners of Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October can bring great temperature fluctuations in the United States while the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There's about 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moyn, Iowa.
In the next few days, the rest of the summer heat will try to increase and expand.
Most of the Central and Eastern United States are expected to have a warm beginning in October, with temperatures above 80 degrees from the south to parts of the north-east.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kawanau's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the attractive adult of the certificate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kawanou and Christine Blacie Ford – the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which occurred in the 80s of the 20th century.
During that time, political opposition continued, as networks interrupted their regular return programmes in the last few minutes of Friday: an agreement that was concluded by the Iranian Senator Jeff Flake and that the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that she was 100% convinced that Kavanau had pressured her to drink and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kawanau, in his lack of emotional evidence, is absolutely certain that something like this has not happened.
It's probably even more than Nielsen's reported 20.4 million viewers were watching the witness on Friday.
The company has listed the average audiences of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no direct data available for other networks that broadcasted the hearing, i.e. PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen in tradition is experiencing difficulties in measuring the number of people who look at their jobs.
For comparison, we're talking about a audience similar to that of a champion football match or Hollywood prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kawanau, is the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-to-day hearing, reports from Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen CBS reportedly had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
The interest remained high and after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
Since the office of the moderate Republican came out with a statement that he would vote in support of Kawanau, the CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday how protestors were playing while trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During the entire brake for a few minutes, he did not raise his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here, I'm standing in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he presents the truth to the state?
"You have power while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Fleke refused that his office had already issued a declaration and, before closing the elevator's doors, announced that it would take place further during the hearing by the Commission.
Cable and broadcasting networks provided a full coverage of live a few hours later when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer the nomination of Kawanau to the attention of the full Senate to vote.
Ala Flake announced that he would do this only if he was sure that the FBI would review the charges against nominations next week, for which the Democrats insist on opposition.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, the senator of the party of the democracies Chris Kowns.
After the conversation with Cuuns and several senators, Flex made a decision.
His election was definitely essential, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes for the approval of Kawanau without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges against Kawanau.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political gambling" with Brexit
Minister-President Teresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political play" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published so far on the first page of the newspaper, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson stepped up his attack against her so-called "Women's Game Plan" for Brexit, suggesting that the collection of customs fees from the UK for the EU and vice versa is "very absurd".
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrest suspects Dietian Simpson for the death of an LSU player
The police arrest suspected of a fatal shooting at Wade Sims, the 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Diten Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and put in prison for second-degree murder charges, reported police in Baton Ruž.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, when the police reported that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the site and they also found Simpson's DNA on them, reported by the branch of CBS WAFB.
After Simpson's investigation, the police reported that he recognized himself as a fatal shot against Wade.
His guarantee is set at $350 000, notified by Advocate.
The Medical Service of Eastern Baton Ruž publishes a preliminary report on Friday, in which the cause of death is referred to a gunshot wound, affecting the head and the door.
The government expresses its gratitude to the department for investigating refugees from the Louisiana State Police, the police crime lab, the South University Police and locals for the assistance they have provided in the investigation, which has contributed to the arrest.
The Director of Athletic Sports of LSU Joe Alva thanks to local law enforcement authorities for "temporary justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The high 6 feet and 6 inches player grew up in Baton Rose, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
Average last season reached 5.6 points and 2.6 rockets in the game.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach announced that the team was "shit" and "in shock" after Wade's death.
Wade said that "this is something that worries people all the time."
Vulcan spreads ashes over Mexico City
The evicted Volcano Popocatepetal ashes reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater has increased and 183 gas and ashes have been recorded in the last 24 hours.
The center's been watching a lot of rabbits and tremors.
Published in the social media shows a thin layer of dust that covers the front glass of cars in some of Mexico City's neighborhoods, for example in Hokimilko.
Geophysics have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 devastated central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the year of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence protests met with the gendarmerie, when thousands joined in protesting demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Polishing Vousto to disengage Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began to mutilate the peacekeepers with eggs and dust color, creating dark and dust clouds on the streets that usually swarm from tourists.
Later in the day, there were other misunderstandings with the police, when the police ran to their thumbs to control the situation.
For hours, groups supporting independence shouted, "We don't forget, we don't forgive," while those announced that the country's integrity was restored with "Spain forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
The tension remains high in the desired independence of the region even the year after the referendum on 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but is reflected by separatist Catholics.
The vast majority voted for independence, although the activity was low, as most of the opponents of the kidnapping boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop the conduct of the vote in the polling stations in the region with a number of violent clashes.
The desired independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was in place, but it was forced to move on a different path.
Narciss Termez of 68, an electrician, joined a separatist protest with his wife, saying he no longer had the hope of getting independence from Catalonia.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be in a position," the man added.
Despite the marked important victory, it was, in a small way, the regional elections in recent December, supporting the independence of the political parties of Catalonia, which are experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their most well-known leaders are either in a self-contained prison or are arrested in anticipation of the process because of their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Pig, a 42-year-old mechanic who wrote his protest phone in support of the police, claims that the conflict was provoked by both politicians.
His comment is that "it's getting more and more tense."
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested Catalan leaders in anticipation of a preliminary process last year, announced that he would be nominated in the European Parliament elections next year.
He claims that "my candidacy for European elections is the best way to oppose the regression of democratic values and the repressions that we see by the Spanish government."
Londoners: Arrested men after the car crashed into the house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 respectively, were arrested after a car hit the house in London several times.
The incident happened in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 a.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings announced damage to both the gate and the building itself.
It's also possible that the car was shot with an arabelet.
Menga's goal is to carry the Livingston victory with 1-0 over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston provides victory
The new guy in the Livingston High League surprised Rangers and just lost Stephen Gerard in his first 18th match as a manager of the Aibrocks Club.
The goal of the Dolly Menga has become decisive, and Gary Holt's team has been balanced with the second in the Hibernia ranking.
Gerard's team doesn't win a foreign field in the High League during this season, and next week it's facing the harts leader, who's eight points left in the ranking.
But before that, Rangers is home to Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a six-game race without a loss in the lead, and manager Holt has not yet felt the taste of loss since he changed his post to Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed good opportunities against the homeless
Holt's team had to lead the result far before he scored the goal, and his direct style of the game was extremely difficult Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried the defense, but his blow went away, then Alan Litgou shot at the grid, after Craig Halket got the ball back with his head on him.
The housekeepers left Rangers to play the ball, knowing that they could seriously make it difficult for the guests to be static.
And that's exactly how it got to the winning goal.
Rangers committed a violation, and Livingston played well, when Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined with each other and ran Manga, who took his ball and scored it from the middle of the field.
So far, Rangers ruled the ball more, but they met the unprovoked protection of the hosts, and the porter Lim Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of game continued during the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers' doorman saved Scott Pittman's foot shot, and a hit with Little's head passed by the door after another static situation for Livingston.
In Livingston's penal field, however, there were centers that were easily cleaned, and the judge twice ignored the claims of the guests for the dump – first after the unanimity between Halket and the Glen Middleton reserve, and then in the case of gambling doubts.
"Penometal" by Livingston – analysis
Alsdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on "Tony Macaroni Arena"
A phenomenal game and a great result for Livingstone.
The team just plays super, continuing to go beyond expectations and improving its performance.
The style of the game and composition almost did not undergo changes after the team returned to the High League, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he changed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the ground.
Captain Halket was amazing, organizing the defense in a surpassing way, while Manga was constantly holding Connor Goldson and Joe Warley under pressure.
At the same time, Rangers didn't show anything inspiring.
Under the leadership of Gerard, they showed you some great things, but in case they were much under those standards.
They missed the last pass before they were naked, only once they managed to break up the protection of the hosts – this loss must wake up Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Kyoln
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship is cold because of problems affecting human rights, the freedom of the media and Turkey's admission to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Kyoln to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For reasons of security, the police prevented a 25-mile crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters who wanted to see their president were trapped around.
Hundreds protesting against Erdogan, many of which Kurds also voted, condemning both the policy of Erdogan itself and the decision of the German government to allow it to go to the country.
The various protests reflect a dispute caused by a visitor who is accepted as a hero by some German Turks and is also despised as a depot by others.
Motorcycle crash in Deptford: A car wrecker rests after a car crash
The driver died after a car crash in London.
The disaster was near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and got medical help, but the driver died in the car.
The crash takes place a few months after another collider died, after he was hit by a runaway driver on Childers Street, located close to a mile from the site of the Saturday disaster.
The mayor's police report that her employees are working to identify the man and then inform his relatives.
The road is closed and the bus lines are turned off, and it is also recommended that motorists avoid the zone.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards were injured in a fight
Six prison guards were injured in a male prison in a high level of security, reports the Prison Service.
The fight broke out in Long Lartin prison in Worchester at around 09:30 in the morning of British time on Sunday and is still going on.
In order to take control, special officials from the "Tordano" team are called, which will have to deal with eight persons deprived of their liberty, with the only interference in a limited to one wing of the prison.
Injured supervisors have suffered mild injuries on their faces and have received medical attention on site.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service made the following statement: “Specially trained servants are invited to deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six supervisors have received medical attention.
We don't tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we make it very clear that responsible persons will be handed over to the police, as their sentences may be extended."
In Long Lartin prison there are more than 500 prisoners, that is, some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was announced that the director of the prison had been ordered to be treated in the hospital after an attack by a prisoner.
Also in October last year, police officers from the parts of the fighting of the peacekeepers were called to prison where they were to have a serious fight, where the personnel were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens with lightning flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although the dried areas may benefit)
Arizona rarely happens to be hit by a tropical storm, but there is a great chance that this will happen early next week, while the weakening hurricane of Rosa is being carried through the desert of the South-West, leading to a risk of flashing floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already set up posts against light floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, in southern and east Nevada, southeastern California and Uta, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to take a different turn over Finishk on Tuesday, as during the late Monday it can bring rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix so far in 1950!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Centre for Hurricane Provisions 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas from the south-west desert, including the Central Scalists Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, and in separate places can be reached by 4 inches of rainfall.
For those who are not threatened by light floods, the rain caused by Rosa can in fact be a blessing, since the region is severely affected by drought.
Although flooding is extremely serious, some of the rain will probably be useful, as the south-west part is currently in the dry state.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring Commission, less than 40% of Arizona suffer from at least excessive drought, which is the second most severe category," weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to reaching the drought at the Baha California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rose, which can still boast at the maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting with colder waters over the Pacific Ocean, and that's why it's getting weaker.
That is why it is expected to reach the drought in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm during Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of floods.
"Summer rains are expected from 6 inches from Baha California to northwestern Sonora, as they are possible up to 10 inches," weather.com reports.
Then Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Uta until Tuesday late at night.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely strong rain in Baha California, north-west Sonora and the desert south-west of the United States," the National Hurricane Centre warns.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening floodwaters and various waste streams in the deserts, as well as landings in the mountains.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old child was discovered with stab wounds in Summerset.
The early boy was discovered in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Northton about 04:00 in the morning of British time on Saturday.
It happened in a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
During the night in the Radstock area, a 17-year-old boy was arrested, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man reported to the police in Avon and Summersett.
The cops are asking anyone who might have shot what happened to them to get in touch with them.
Trump says that Kawanou "has suffered from pride and anger" of the democratic party
"Every vote for Judge Kavanau is a vote that rejects the cowardly and disturbing tactics of the democratic party," Tromp said at a meeting in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kawanau had "suffered by the pride and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Kawanou testified to Congress on Thursday, categorically rejecting Kristin Blacie Ford's charge of sexual assault decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing of the prosecution.
The president made a statement on Saturday that "the American people today have witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities" of Kawanau.
"Every vote in support of Judge Kavanau is a vote in support of one of the brightest legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in the service of the public," the president said before the meeting a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president saw the nomination of Kawanau indirectly, while he was talking about the importance of the republican votes for the general elections.
"There are five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I'm not a candidate, I'm actually also involved," Trump continued.
"That's why I go around and fight in support of good candidates."
Trump noted that the Democrats have set themselves up as a mission "to prevent and impede".
The first key procedural vote in the Kawanau nomination Senate is expected to take place no later than Friday, as reported to CNN one of the collaborators of the High Representative of the Republican Party.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, number of victims of growth
At least 384 people lost their lives, after many had been taken from the softer coast of the giant waves, when strong earthquakes and tsunamis struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, the authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when the border was marked by waves up to six meters (18 feet), took many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami rises after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the threat of tsunamis increased yesterday, people were still on the beach and they did not run away immediately, so many became victims of the disaster," said the spokesperson of the agency for overcoming the plight of Indonesia's BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
"The water was attracted by its car, trees, whole houses, hit everything along its way," Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at 800 km/h (497 m/h), before hitting the shore.
"Some people returned to the trees and thus managed to escape the water," he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated at 24 centers in Palu.
Published by the crash agency, images from air showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, collected and torn bridges, as well as surrounded by the water of the mosque.
The second rabbits continued to July the coastal city on Saturday.
The order of earthquakes was settled in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) made a statement that energy released from the fifth massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than that released on the Hiroshima Atomic Bomb during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of the long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "great" and specified that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the skulls are built, added the speaker, then added that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be higher on the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the truce.
He also added that "communications are completely cut off and there is no information from Dongala".
The red cross from its side indicated that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers have already moved to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can be even harder."
On Saturday, the agency was furiously criticised for not informing about the defeat of Palu tsunamis, although officials explained that the waves arrived during the announcement of the message.
Shared in social networks, favorite videos show a man on the top floor of the building who screams at people on the street panic alerts about the approaching tsunamis.
After a few minutes a huge water wall bursts into the shore and deals with both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the clip in time.
Earthquake and tsunami have led to a severe interruption of electricity supply, which has stopped communications around Palu, thus making it difficult for authorities to coordinate saving efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, reported by the responsible authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other products of the first need.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joco Weidodo will visit the evacuation centres in Pali this week.
The deaths in the Indonesian tsunami are already over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision officials from Dongala managed to reach Palu safely, where they found refuge in the brent shelters that had been set up in their office yard, they passed a series of desert scenes, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw countless destroyed houses."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the start of the rescue and recovery work by emergency groups, some complain that the rich experience of such situations has prevented foreign rescuers from reaching Palau.
Under Indonesian regulations, the financing, dispatch of personnel and supplies from abroad may only start if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The battle is still at regional level," said Aulia Ariani, a speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Since the government has announced that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but from there they have not yet declared such a status."
While above Palu falls the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who are still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones have somehow survived natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Hendon Subandono, the coach of the National Committee on Paraplanetism of Indonesia, trained two of the missing paraplanetaries for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the prisoners trapped in the Roa-Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As an elder in the field of paraplanerism, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Hendon recalled that in the hours after the news of the collapse of Roa-Roa Hotel reached the community on paraplanarism, he was desperate to send messages on WhatsApp to the competitors in Palo who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue marks, however, the only answer to his messages was one-one gray one.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Thieves raise $26,750 while charging a ATM in Levi's Newport
On Friday morning, the thieves picked up $26,750 from Brink's staff, who charged a ATM in Newport Levi, became clear from the press release of the police office in Newport.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM into the fun complex and was ready to charge it with money, says Detective Dennis Makarti in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “has approached running behind the back of Brink’s servant” and stole the purse with money.
The Witnesses noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, continuing the message, but the police did not specify the number involved in the theft.
All those who have information about the identity of the suspects must contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kenya West: Rapper changes her name
Rapper Kany West changed his name to her.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: "The man, officially known as Kenya West".
West, 41, has for some time been wearing its proponent and used it as a title for its eighth album, which was released in June.
The change won his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
He changes the Ariana Grande song into the show, which was rejected "for emotional reasons", the show's creator tells us.
Except that it's a reduction in his current professional name, West, and before he said that the word is religious to him.
"I believe that "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where "you" or "you," West said earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with the radio-leading Big Boy.
"That way I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
He moved from Kenya, which means only one person, simply to Him – which is a reflection of good in us, evil, confusion, and everything.
The album is rather a reflection of our nature."
Rapper is one of many known in his field who changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of precursors and names, including Puff Dadi, Pi Didi, or Didi, but this year he announced his preference to the pseudonyms Louv and Brother Louv.
One of the former West co-workers, J. Z., also presented himself in a version with or without arrow and/or main letters in his pen.
Mexico's President swore not to use the army against civilians
Newly-elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn that he will never use military force until the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, Tlatelolko Plaza President Lopes Obrador promised "never to use the army to push the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people while students with left political views gradually spread across Latin America.
Lopes Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and discovering more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of the development of the IMI
At a time when China becomes increasingly active on the front of artificial intelligence development, the United States has to double its research budget in this area, claims the researcher and developer of II Kai-Fu Loy, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was sent after different calls from the U.S. government made statements on the topic for II, although the U.S. has no official strategy for II as a whole.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: the country strives to become number 1 from innovations in the IP by 2030.
"Introducing the EI development budget will be a good start, given that all other countries are far away from the US and are expected to make next breakthroughs with respect to EI," Lee said.
The duplication of funding can also double the chances of the next major achievement in the US in the US, as Lee informs CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book "The Superpowers of II: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the lead executive director of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the largest companies for II in China – Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Melon Lee University, he worked on a system that won the most successful hotel player in America, after which he was CEO of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee gives the duty to the former technology competitions of the federal government, such as the Agency's robotics competition for improved defence research projects, and asks when the next one will be of help to identify new visionaries.
"Students in the United States often have to work well to win government funding," Lee explained.
"Not China takes the academic leaders, but the corporations," said the man.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lights to work on I.I.
Lee also claims that the changes in immigration policy can help the US strengthen its II programme.
"I believe that doctors in II science should automatically offer green maps," said the husband.
The US State Council announced its plan for the development of artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding for people from academic institutions in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other state organizations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Li explains.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from industry and academics, and from the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA also announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, more than $100 million per year are currently invested in the development of the IFI.
In the meantime, the US legislative body, which wanted to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not observed any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum to change the name of their country
Macedonia's citizens voted in a referendum this week to change the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that would allow the ongoing ten-year dispute with Greece that blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, argues that its northern neighbour's name is a claim against its territorial integrity, which requires the veto of its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
Both governments have reached agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Georgie Ivanov said he himself would not vote in the referendum, while the campaign for boycotting him cast a shadow of doubt whether the referendum will be able to reach the minimum 50% required for recognition of his validity.
The issue of the bulletins is as follows: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that their price is due to be paid in order to achieve the entry of the formed after the collapse of Macedonia in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the country's future, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough Members of Parliament have indicated that they will comply with the outcome of it to such an extent that the speech is already of decisive importance.
In order to change the name of the country, two thirds of parliamentary representatives must therefore vote.
The National Electoral Commission announced that no reports of irregularities were available by 1 afternoon.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters visited the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Goose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen of Skopje capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will discover the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Cavadarkov, on 54, prepared a small stage and distributed chairs in front of the palaces, which were set up by the boycotting referendums.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proud heads raised, not through the door for servants," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as more than 80% of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said, after giving his own vote.
The State party also stated that the positive result would lead to "confirming the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Research publishes research results that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is under the required focus.
Another study, the work of Macedonian TV Telma, reported that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote with "Yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious attack on the pro-Western government's policy since it won power last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes through the entire defense of Brighton and scores goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling overcome the protection of Brighton and brought the victory of Manchester City with 2-0 on Saturday of "Ethid Stedium" in Manchester, England.
Aguero's going naked in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine golfer was found with a dog in the middle of the field.
He ran three defenders from Brighton before he printed with the ball in the empty space forward.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four players in green.
He slipped across one of the defenders, then left behind the rest of the border on the penal field of Brighton.
Then he left for Sterling.
The English attacker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who struck with his right foot across the door of Brighton Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his door.
"Aguero is struggling with some contusions in his feet," City Pep Guaardiola's manager told reporters.
"We planned he to play about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky you scored the goal right now."
But Sterling was the one that provided the initial advance of the "heavens" in this match of the High League of England.
He was registered in 29 minutes.
In the naked situation, Aguero got a bid deep in half of Brighton.
He immediately released the performer's dog on the left flank to Liroy Sane.
Sane progressed with the ball, after which he found Sterling with a dog on the distance.
The attacker of the "heavens" was able to cut close, just before the ball got in the car.
City will face Hofenheim in a match from the group phase of the Championship League at 12:55 on Tuesday afternoon at Rain Necar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to play determine the fate of Rockies
After the Nationals were not classed for the playoffs, there's no special sense for another match of a titular starting drinker.
And yet the ambitious Shercer always hopes to be a Sunday titular against Colorado Rockies, if the sword is important to Rockies, who lead a match with Los Angeles Dodgers in the ranking of NL West.
Rockies guaranteed their participation at least in the Wild Card game after winning with 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is still not certain that they will win their first title in the division.
"Although we ourselves do not fight for anything, we want to finish the season with a nice match in Denver, where the audience and the other team will give everything of their own to win perhaps the most important match for them during the year.
Why would I want to miss such a match?"
Nationals have not yet announced a starting drinker for a week, but it is assumed that they will allow Shercer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Shercer, this would be the 34th match as a starting drinker this year, when he was practicing on Thursday and would have the normal time to rest by Sunday.
Washington's right-hand drinker has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 inches this season.
Trump's recruiting supporters in West Virginia
The President of the Cosmos was concerned about the situation with his electorate on Supreme Court Brett Kawanau, while he was talking about the importance of Republican votes in the general elections.
"In November everything we have achieved will be at risk.
They leave five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the biggest moments in the current history – I also say that even though I am not a candidate, I actually look at myself as well, that's why I'm fighting all the forces for the right candidates," Trump said.
Then he went on with, “All you see is this terrible radical group of democracies, you see them with your eyes.
They are determined to return their power in any way, you are themselves witnesses of their integrity, of their wickedness.
They don't care when they can hurt, who they have to run, to get into power and control, because they only care about power and control, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, according to the President, have set themselves to "stop and prevent".
"As we all see in the last four days," he continued, calling the democracies "enraged, ugly, deceitful and unfaithful".
The president recalled the Senate Judicial Commission, mentioning the Senator of Democrats Diane Finnstein, which has caused strong riots from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
Please, what?
No, no, I've been waiting – it was really bad cruelty – maybe the worst I've ever seen."
The labyrinths are no longer wide.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, a few were surprised.
In the end, I am just the last member of Parliament for the time being of the Liberals, who was declared not to have come – just because I am speaking openly.
My group in Parliament, Joan Ryan, had a similar attitude, since it was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship criticises me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, those that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy disagreed during the previous leaders.
The report on Nottingham East's meeting said on Friday that "we want the meetings to include all and be useful".
During most of my eight years as a local representative of the Libyans in parliament, the Friday meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and the promises of "lighter and moderate" policies have long been forgotten if ever they were on the agenda.
It became increasingly apparent that different views were not tolerated in the Liberian party and that any opinion was assessed on the basis of this as much as the party's leadership liked.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I had previously worked for thought that shared similar political views began to expect me to turn around and take up positions that I would never agree with – whether in national security or in the single market of the EU.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I'm actually saying – there's a whole bloody tyranny in the social networks, where it's called for withdrawal, rejection of moderate politics, statements that they don't belong to the cyberists.
It's not just me.
In the interest of the truth, I know that I have even drawn more luck from some of my colleagues, since the comments about me are at least mainly of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who stand up to sexist or racist subjugations every day, without fear of them.
One of the greatest disappointments of this era in politics is how such temptations have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the labs had to embrace the culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer wide-ranging, with every sign of mistrust or change of the rules of choice becoming increasingly narrower.
In the last two years, I've got a lot of advice to bend, not to talk so much and then "everything will be fine".
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Liberals 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the Tacher government, which, through neglect, led to a physical breakdown in my excellent school, I fought for better public services for those who need them most – either as a local councillor or as a minister.
I have never concealed my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way from my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state reaches Brexit, it will harm the households, companies and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the labs.
But really my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Liberians, or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of withdrawal or political dismissal will deny me to act in the way I consider the best in protecting your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: The Inevitable Air led in the ranking
The two late essays may have changed slightly the final result, but there is no doubt that Eer deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match by the High League of Tennent.
The team is already heading the ranking and the only ten teams are without loss to the moment.
The better protection and the better use of the possibilities have proved to be decisive in the match, from which coach Peter Murchi and his team can be very happy.
"I'm happy because the other teams tested us very seriously in the previous matches, and we're still without loss," Marchi noted.
Robin Kristi of Melrose said, "Congratulations for Eer, they really took advantage of their provisions better than we did."
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional hit by Frasier Klimo, led Eer forward as a result, but a yellow card for the Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play a match by Waryers, allowed Melrose to reverse the result, after Jason Bagot realized it, followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
Klimo increases the front of Air by a penalty strike shortly before half-time, marking the essays after salt action, and then performing the additional strike with which you scored 17-5 for Air on the holiday.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful additional blow to Baggo, reduced the front to only five points.
The game was followed by a continuous suspension due to the severe contusion of Ruarid Nott, which was exported to the carrier, and after the renewal of the match Eer increased their advance after the essay of Stafford McDoual and a successful additional hit of Klimo.
Then, the active captain of Air Blair Mcferson received a yellow card and Melrose again benefited from their numerous advantages, being a strong pressure and carrying out essays through Bruce Colvin, followed by a unsuccessful additional blow.
However, the hosts returned the presence of the spirit and when Stroan Hutchinson received a yellow card, after defeating Klimo without a ball, after the subsequent penalisation of Makferson carried out the essays with the help of Eer's advanced offensive line.
Klimo performs the additional strike, not long after he did it again, after Kyle Row caught the ball kicked by David Armstrong and carried out Gregor Henry's wing on the flag for the fifth axis of the hosts.
The star of Still Game seems to have focused on a new career in the restaurant business
The star of Still Game Ford Kirnan seems to have directed himself to a more direct and warmer industry after it was discovered that it was appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in BBC's popular broadcast, which is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
The two announced that the upcoming nine season would be the last for the transmission, and it seems that Kirnan is already planning his life after Kreiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Aeringmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan had intended to be involved in the "exploiting restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": the absence of the exit of the sea Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
The sailors are constantly patrolling the occupiers with the same sea level in La Paz.
Over the public buildings there's an ocean son of a flag.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are decorated with the motto: “The sea is right.
It's our duty to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit, handed over to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century, is still alive – as well as the call to sail again from the Pacific.
In fact, this hope is now stronger than decades ago, while Bolivia is waiting for a verdict from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years have passed into consideration.
"The force is in Bolivia, everywhere it feels vindictive and unity, as the country expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kaldazila.
Many Bolivians will see the judgment of the international court of the big screen all over the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's request and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Here Morales, Bolivia's charismatic local president, who is about to go to a fight to re-election next year, has also placed a lot and a lot of judgment on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the possibility of the court making a decision in favour of Bolivia is quite small, even if it decides in favour of it, it would not change things in reality.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no power to take over Chile and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgement of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the last arguments indicates that the case "is not complicated", rejects Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may actually have hurt her.
"The problem of access to the ocean has been separated from the current Bolivian government," Zarate said.
Then he suggested that the military rhetoric of Morales made a difference and that the little thing remained Chile's good will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at a given time, but it will be extremely difficult to hold a normal dialogue after what has happened.
The two sides do not support diplomatic missions in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision is being made extremely quickly.
According to him, on Monday, Bolivia will have "the incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile", as well as the chance to "stop 139 years of disagreement by reaching benefits for both countries".
Kaldzila also rejected the idea that Morales, who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the problem of accessing the ocean as a "political patrimony".
"Bolivia will never give up its right to leave the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems."
North Korea claims it won't continue with nuclear disarmament until it can't believe the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Yong Ho says his country will never go to nuclear disarmament first if he is unable to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing parties in Singapore.
His comment comes after the US Secretary of State Mike Pompey seems to be on the verge of re-launching the endless nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting with Kim Young Un from North Korea in Singapore.
Ri called "empty hope" the idea that continuing US sanctions and objections to a declaration that would put an end to the Korean war would cause the North to fall on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the declaration without Phanyan first making a significant gesture on the way to disarmament.
Both Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, are looking for a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Phenian they are serious about their rejection of the arsenal, which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompey plans to visit Phanyan next month to arrange for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Modern reviews in Paris reveal the latest list of massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your collection from hats or completely block the sunlight, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which had made the fashion floor during the Fashion Week in Paris.
I caused a lot of non-practical hats in Instagram during the summer, when designers sent eyebrows to their creations to lure the fashion community.
Valentino's popping proposal was an extravagance of an escape hat with a very wide periphery, which literally swallowed the heads of the models.
Other too huge accessories included decorated with jewelry, magic hat and even pineapple – but they do not aim to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – in this exact time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their mouth shut and reminded not as much of the higher fashion as of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designers liked the equipment for humming in a full set of snorkels and glasses, while the other looked like a slow funnel ice cream.
If you fall for such fashion trends, you're lucky.
Modern specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold at fashion shops near you.
The huge hats come very soon after "La Bomba" – the slender hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on the heads of all – from Riana to Emily Ratajovski.
The cult to the extremely unpractice hat that took over social networks led to the appearance of another huge design of the fashion floor – a slender beach bag, almost as large as wearing it with a bath model.
The raffia bag with the color of burnt orange, fresh from raffia and decorated with a white handle, was the attractive all-seeing article in the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Famousstist Luke Armitid said in front of FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in fashion shops next summer – after the designer made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore the search for erodobarite accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic distinction, which continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of the test results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS) aim to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education, chosen by them and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can form and implement a personal learning program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language that you understand, your words will reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see that languages are first of all with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved a high score A.
The data collected from 74 members of the SCIS schools show that 72% of students achieved an A assessment in Chinese, with the same evaluation being 72% of German students, 69% of French and 63% of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland accept foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
At present, languages as the subject of free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) as in the programmes of independent schools and beyond.
A study carried out by the UK Employment and Labour Commission in 2014 showed that for reasons of difficulties in finding employees, 17% indicated insufficient language skills.
Therefore, the growing rule of foreign languages becomes necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more job positions require the rule of a foreign language, which turns these skills into essentials in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person has a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future after he has such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the ruling few languages one person's chests before competition.
According to a study by YouGov of more than 4,000 full-time citizens of the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not have a foreign language that they could speak a language well enough, as French was the only language whose governance reached a double percentage of 15%.
That's why investment in language learning is important to children now.
The management of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will differ from one language to another.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the United Kingdom in the future plan by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their area.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life, regardless of what the future holds.
At the moment it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country, which requires this to be taken into account in the educational system.
Indeed, modern languages must really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, together with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.

Lebron will make his debut for Lakers this week in San Diego
Waiting's almost over for the fans who can't see Lebron James' first match with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would take part in the first match of the pre-season training team against Denver Nugets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he'll play in the double.
"It will be on the ground between one and 48 minutes," said Walton via Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudel, told Tweeter that James would probably play a relatively few minutes in the match.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the six matches from Lakers' preseason training.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season swords to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of election meetings tonight in Wyling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned summits of Trump, which include stops in known places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By deferring the veto for its election to fill the free place in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republics are threatened by the loss of control over the Congress in the submission of the votes in November.
What time will the Trump meeting be held in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Wyling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours, east time tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wyling, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
The Trump will probably consider hearings this week for the appointment of Supreme Court Brett Cavano, in which tension arises due to allegations of immoral sexual acts, which held the Senate's veto for up to one week while the FBI's investigation was ongoing.
However, the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republics to gain energy for the November elections.
That's why President Donald Trump's campaign announced that these five meetings next week are aimed at "activizing volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to his program that the President will visit as many states as possible and we start a campaign season with commitments," Reuters spokesperson for the Trump campaign, which refuses to be mentioned.
The meeting tonight, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wyling, can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
This Saturday will be the second trip to Trump for this month in West Virginia – the state in which it won with more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Republican Patrick Morrisi, who remains in social studies.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisy that the president came to give him a boost in social studies," said Simon Heather, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
"Rider Cup" 2018: US team will fight to the last, keeping their hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without an intrigue of "foursome" matches on Sunday afternoon might have brought what Rider Cup needed.
Changing the edge of the sport is a very subjective concept in which players, however, firmly believe in more of the rivals like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They've been running six points, and now there's only four, so I guess we've got a little bit of energy," Jordan Spjet said at the end of today's competition day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage at only twelve more to distribute.
As Spit says, however, Americans have something else to show, and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge in the sports form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Speet shows a great shape from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The cheering bells of the fans became stronger as he progressed in the round, in which with a precise impact he equaled the result in the fourth match, after two strikes with Thomas remained after the first two holes.
His strike, which won their 15th hole, was met with strong reactions that make us believe that not everything is lost for the American team.
"The important thing is not to think about anything else and focus on your own match," Spiethe says.
That's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points from Spjet and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitoud, the irreconcilable heroes of "Rader Cup" so far.
The strange but charming couple from Europe won four out of four and it looks like they got everything.
Molywood was the only couple who didn't make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't have "bogie" on Saturday mornings, or Friday afternoons or mornings.
These consecutive successes, as well as the way that energy was passing between them and the enthusiastic fans, confirmed the view that they were players who would win on Sunday and there would be no better couple than Flitoud and Molinari, who would bring the potential victory of Europe while the sun goes over Le Golf National.
For the preference of both at the same time on different holes.
However, the stories of European glory have proved a little premature.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the "fourball" matches in the morning while he was partnering with Alex Norren.
"Gods" and two "devils" of the first nine holes have brought Spanish and Swedish into problems they failed to deal with.
But there's no way anyone else can solve your problems in the Sundays.
Fourball and Foursam match are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between the two, the councils that exchange between each other, and the way in which a strategy can undergo changes at any moment.
Europeans played better teammates, so they got a significant lead before the last day, but this "foursome" match session showed that the American team is also ready to fight until the last – something in which many people, especially in the United States, were deeply suspicious.
Europe runs from 10 to 6 in the last day of "Rader Cup".
Europe will have a solid front before the last day of "Raider Cup", after he led the US from 10 to 6 after playing the matches of the "fourball" and "foursome" formats on Saturday.
The inspiring duet Tommy Flitoud and Francesco Molinari began with two victories against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, with which their assets in the Le Golf National race grew to four points.
In an attempt to return to the trophies that lost Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn dominated the morning 'fourball' matches over Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and finally Europe won the 3-1 win series.
The U.S. has proved more resistance to the "foursome" games where they won two victories, but they have failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furick's team needs 8 points from the 12th single match on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was Europe's first new recruiter, won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known as Molywood, after this sensational weekend became only the second couple, won four points from their first four matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After unappealing Woods and Patrick Reid in the "fourball" matches, they were extremely motivated to defeat the Woods and American novelist Bryson Decambu with an even more categorical result 5&4.
Woods, who barely passed through his two matches on Saturday, only from time to time demonstrated his geniuses, but so far there are 19 losses of 29 matches in the "fourball" and "foursome" matches, as well as seven consecutive losses in total.
Justin Rose, got a break for the morning 'fourball' matches, partnered with Henrik Stanson in the 'fours' match with 2&1 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copka – respectively number one and number three in the world.
The European team, however, failed to enjoy a very pleasant, cold and unfurnished day south-west of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spyt and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a difficult victory with 2§1 against Spanish John Ram and Jan Polter in the "fourball" matches, and later they returned to win Polter and Rory Makilroy with 4&3 in the "fours" meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the "Rader Cup" has been a team to raise four points of deficit before the singles, and according to the rules, the Furick team will hold a trophy even at the same time.
After two consecutive days, however, their chances of turning on Sunday do not seem to be particularly high.
North Korea says "no way" to disarm one side, without confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea announced to the UN on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepened the mistrust to the US and there was no way for the country to abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the world organization, Ri Yong-hoo said that "significant measures have been taken in recent years", for example, we stop nuclear and missile testing, destroy nuclear testing and promises not to distribute nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
"Without trusting in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and under no circumstances there is any way to disarm ourselves on the one hand."
While Ri expressed well-known North Korea's complaints about Washington's resistance to a "step-by-step" approach to eliminating nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded, since it took step-by-step measures, his statement seemed significant, since it did not reject the unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Phanyan did in the past.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Chen Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on "the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", and Trump provided guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking the official end of the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the US says that Phanyan must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington also objected to calls to facilitate strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists that we remove nuclear weapons first and increase the pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal by force, and even object to "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The understanding that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a meaningless dream of those who do not know us.
The problem, however, is that continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether to hold a second meeting between Kim and Trump, for which the US leader stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the minister focuses on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jain over the past five months and adds: “If the country on nuclear disarmament was South Korea, not the United States, the removal of the nuclear weapons of the Korean peninsula would not reach such a halt.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from the previous year, when he said to the UN general assembly that the direction of North Korean missiles to the continental part of the United States is inevitable after "the evil president" Trump called Kim a "human rocket" on the suicide mission.
This year in the UN Trump, which threatened North Korea last year with "complete destruction", praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must remain in force while North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there is no time for this and said, "It doesn't matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Penyan for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompey said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must necessarily continue until complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is carried out."
The Security Council unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop financing the nuclear programme and the Phanyan ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met with Ri at the summit of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Phenyan again next month to prepare for the second summit.
This year Pompey visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Phanyan in July with the words that he had made progress, but only a few hours later North Korea accused him of having made "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States took "the appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that the "responsible measures" he was seeking are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard for a long break
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in an attempt to reverse the growing culture of learning "all night" with the help of caffeine.
The teacher found that students at the university number one in the world often don't even think about how to take care of themselves when it comes to the very foundations.
Charles Kaysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the hospital in Brigam and the hospital for women, prepared a course that he thought was the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the effect of sleep loss on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and said, "Why are they telling me even now, in my last year?"
She said that no one has ever told her the importance of the dream that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which takes place for the first time this year, explains to students the most important about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Baraira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
At the same time, the course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a neighborhood, where students tap on a cup of coffee, curtains, marathons and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements affect the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the sleeping routine.
In another part of the participants, it is explained how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects on the health of the choice to smoke," added Professor Kaysler.
The culture of pride from "learning all night" still exists, he says and adds that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that falling asleep is a growing problem.
Ensuring sufficient and quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says – even to avoid filling, as the loss of sleep in the mode of hunger causes them to be hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaysler in the preparation of the course, taking one of his classes in Harvard during his first year.
He says his course "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is that all graduates will be asked to complete such a training programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaysler recommends students to think about whether to set up a bedtime and wake-up alarm and to know the harmful effects of "the blue light", released from electronic screens and LED lighting that can disrupt the circus rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's goal broke Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Stephen Gerard's wireless team and won a 1-0 win for Livingston.
The ibrox team wanted to record its first victory as a triumphal guest in February with 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only struck Gerard's second defeat in the 18th as a manager, leaving his team with eight points less than the late Harts team, leader of the Ledbrokes High League.
Manga scored seven minutes before the break, and the lack of constructive ideas from Rangers' team at no point seemed close to the equation.
After the Rangers' match, they're in the sixth place, and Livingstone is already third, leaving the second Hibranian alone on the head.
For Rangers there may also be additional problems, since the side judge Kalum Spence got a head wound after being hit with an object that was obviously thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that broke Air into the semifinals of the Battle of Scotland League.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same unit of Livingstone, who pulled out a point against Harts last week, and should be satisfied with the way his aggressive team stopped all the actions of the opponent.
Rangers could have dominated the ball, but Livingstone did better in the rarest cases when they owned it.
They were supposed to mark in the second minute when Menga took out a touch with Scott Pittman against doorkeeper Alan McGregger, but the semi-defenseman missed the opportunity.
Later, Keegan Jacobs' center of Faul found Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defense Alan Litgou turned the ball away from the rear.
Rangers took control of the game, but they couldn't create anything in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought there should be a hole in the 15th minute when he met Stephen Loules, but the report by Stephen Thompson rejected the claims of the Colombians.
Rangers had only two exact hits in the first half, but the former doorkeeper of Ibronx Liam Kelly was easily hit with the head of Lasana Kulibali and with the weak shot of this Edjaria.
Although Livi's attack in the 34th minute was surprising in view of the ball's possession, it was absolutely deserved.
Rangers couldn't cope with Jacobs' deep focus again.
Scott Arfield doesn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold blood gave Manga, for which it was easy to realize.
Gerard responded to the break by changing Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately led to the result when the wing gave Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out firmly and blocked the strike.
Livingston, however, continued to force guests to play in comfortable for the home style of the game, as Litgou and Halket constantly refused to send forward long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its front in the last few minutes, but McGregor managed to deal with Jacobs' strike, and with the next Corporal Litgou shot with his head next to the grid.
The one who entered the Glen Middleton reserve from Rangers was looking for a hole at the end of the double after co-operation with Jacobs, but Thompson saw nothing wrong in the situation again.
Anniversary: The Designer of the Geiger numerator
A site of our anniversary Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger develops a method for tracking and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately leads to the creation of the device, known as the Geiger's counter.
A corner stone in science since then, the shark counter has also become a corner stone of pop culture, when in 1950 the film "Kampan of Kornadno" appeared, in which the amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans apparently participated.
A man: “What is that to God?
Rogers: This is a giant counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these hearing aids, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms separated from the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure he's shooting right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, only a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment
The method includes removing immune cells from the patient and changing them to the laboratory
Then they can "see" a protein that is common to many types of cancer and re-injected in the patient.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes removing immune cells from the patient and modifying them into the laboratory so that they can "see" protein, common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then injecting again into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofski of the U.S. National Oncology Institute in Betadad, Maryland: "The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including the breast, ovaries, white lungs and colorectal carcinoma, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and their "learning" how to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kenny West spoke in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the inscription "Let's make America big again", in our participation in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was staged in the studio during Saturday Night Live, after he made a meaningless performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would apply for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Let's make America big again," he announced against the Democrats and said his support for Trump.
"I talk very often to white people and they ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with Matt Damon's participation, in which the Hollywood star played on Brett Kavana's testimony to the Senate's Legal Commission for Sexual Violence Complaints by Christine Blaze Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the West performance record was embedded in social networks by the comic book Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to play West with his publication.
Besides, West complained in front of the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They tortured me behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go out with this hat."
They tortured me!
And then they claim I'm on a sinking ship," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
Weust continues: "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", arguing that he will wear Superman's costume, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love."
The comments provoked at least twice the public and members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed, said Variety, as one of them said, "The whole studio is closed."
West was invited at the last moment to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
Vest contaminants many with the performance of the song "I Love it", dressed as a bottle "Perie".
West received the support of the manager of the conservative group TPUSA, Candès Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "On one of the bravest: Thank you for making the deal."
However, Karen Hunter's lead show on Twitter said that West was just "self and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (whether I buy his music or his clothes or support his "artificial") for whom I think he welcomes and distributes an ideology that is valuable to society.
He's free.
That's what we are," she added.
Before the show rapper reported on Twitter that he changed his name, as now "is officially known as Kenny West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he follows Didi's example, also known as Puff Didi, Puffy and Pi Didi.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dog, was called Snoop Lion, and the musical legend Prince changed his name with a symbol.
Indictment for attempted murder after shooting a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The accused is expected to appear before the Magistrate Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The star of "Igran a Thrones" Kit Harrington is against toxic manhood
Kit Harrington is known for the role of the flying game John Snow in the full with violence of the medieval fantasy series of the NGO's "Play of Thrones".
But the actor, who is 31 years old, spoke against the stereotype of the sword hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen leads to this often young people thinking that they should be "grapes", to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something was wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently got married to her partner from Rose Leslie's Throne Game, also at 31, admits that she feels "strongly convinced", that this problem must be solved.
"I am personally convinced – what have we confused about manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach grown-up men about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may in part be responsible for increasing toxic manhood due to many male characters.
He continued: “What is born again, and what is taught?
What is taught by television and the street that makes the boys feel they have to turn into this particular type of man?
I think this is really one of the big issues of our time – how can we change it?
'Cause obviously something's wrong with young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in the prehistoric or continuations of the "Game of Thrones" after the end of the series in the next summer, arguing that he was "combined with the battlefields and horses".
From November Kit will play part in the restoration of the "Truth West" of Sam Shepherd, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently said that dating his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in the Thrones Game.
"I met my wife in this series, so that way he gave me my future family and set my life ahead," he said.
Rose's playing the game, the girl that Kit John Snow's hero is in love with, in the fantasy series, the bearer of Emmy's award.
The two were married in June 2018 in the house of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump on the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to health services, more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were some 40,000 new cases reported.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contacts, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, HIV is spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of a blood transfusion.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way is almost zero, said of China's health services at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and spin in China is increasing by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the KGB communities was widespread.
According to studies on conservative values, 70-90% of men who had sexual contacts with men are ultimately married to women.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases are due to inadequate protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Government of China pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to have data leaking from senators from the Republican Party, he pledges "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, the U.S. Chamber of Representatives, Maxine Waters, condemned the allegations that a member of her team had published personal information to three state senators of the Republic of Wikipedia's legislators' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were made by experts and sites on the "ultra right wing".
"Flays, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsay Gram from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Uta.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during the hearing of the Senate's composition on charges of sexual misconduct against a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kawanau.
The discharge is effective after the three senators have questioned Kavanau.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identified the source of the publications, was linked to the Waters office, and sent information about her team member, according to Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these misleading and false claims – is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly provoked online criticism, including from the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flasher.
"In this denial there is poison," Flysher wrote.
"This implies that it does not have the temperature appropriate for a Congress member.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
It's not supposed to be challenging.
I should not question the accused's motives.
He must be calm and balanced."
Flasher compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kawano's democrats, who was accused of criticizing him, that he also seemed angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navaro, a candidate from the Republican for the place of Waters in the mid-elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"In fact, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had examined the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these misleading claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be placed under legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for all my team members."
"Jony Ingleis's Revue Re-Exploses" – the weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for transfers to Brexit in every new film with British participation, and it seems that this also applies to the re-establishment of the Exhen-Comedy, a spy Frenchman for Johnny English – who started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English returned.
Will the self-smoothing and myths that say how clearly we are stupid become a new opportunity for the nation's export?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with round eyes and a "gummy" person has the permission to repeat things for the second time – his name is of the utmost importance when it comes to a large comical creation intended for viewers of the cinema who do not speak English.
He, of course, is a stupid secret agent, who despite his strange claims for a pleasant flash, owns a little from Kluzo, a little from Mr. Bein and a large part of the man who contributed with a note on the music theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
In addition, it is originally based on the chaos that leaves behind itself a traveler and an international man who Atkinson plays in Barclaycard's already forgotten TV ads.
In the last movie with Johnny English, there are two good times.
I liked it when Johnny Ingles approached the helicopter, carrying in the middle of the day, and for a short time the feathers stuck in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strange, especially when "serious" films like "007" and "Mission impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humour seems more focused on the children, not on the adults, but on Johnny English's smears, which I think are not innovative and focused, as Actinson's game does not remind Mr. Bein.
The current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked the British super-secret network of spies and discovered the identity of all operational agents for the horror of the day agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for a prime minister, who is a superfluous and pessimistic figure and already suffers from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives everything to himself about this quazi-Teresa-May role, but there is nothing to work on in the scenario.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that she should call a retired agent, as all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a school teacher in a shock center, but who illegally teaches lessons about being a covert agent: here are some good attacks when English rules out a spy rock academy.
English has been called to Whitehall for quick instruction and meets again with his former long-term assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man married to a watertight commander, a fun role in which Vicki Peperdin's talent is a bit pliant.
Thus, Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of the secret services of Her Majesty and meet with the fatal beautiful Ofelia Bouletova, played by Olga Curilenko.
Meanwhile, the Minister-President is under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technological billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Walt, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo start their oasis from Fars: dressed as waiters, burn a French restaurant; create chaos when they slip into the luxurious island of Volta; and English causes a real anarchy when trying to use a helmet for virtual reality to recognize the interior of the Volta house.
All the jokes are definitely taken from the previous film, but since it's so nice and noisy, there's a lot more content here for children.
A lot of intermediate production.
Like other films about Johnny English, I keep thinking: Can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
The labs deny that they plan to work four days a week, but get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbin's labyrinth party is thinking about a radical plan that says British work four weeks, but get paid for five.
The party claims that the company's bosses want to provide the savings made through the revolutionary artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers, giving them another day of rest.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but get the same pay.
The sources say that the idea of the economic program and the party's plans would be "safe" for workers.
The transition to a four-day work week is approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior source of the Liberian party told The Sunday Times: “It is expected to be announced before the end of the year for policy review.
"Not to happen immediately, but the four-day work week is an effort that is included in the approach to rebalancing the economy for workers, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Liberian Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day work week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this effort does not meet the approval of the entire Liberian party.
Laberist speaker said: "The four-day work week is not part of the party's policy I don't think about it."
The chancellor in the shadow John McDonald uses the labyrinth conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to take power back from "unfair directors" and "speculants" in municipal services companies.
The plans of the chancellor in the shadow also mean that the present owners of shares in the water supply companies may not receive their full share, as the Liberian government could impose "flashes" on the basis of the established violations.
He also confirmed the plans to put employees on board companies and create privatisation funds to transfer 10 per cent of the net capital of private companies to employees who can accumulate annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy speak "60 minutes" if the investigation of Cavano by the FBI can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavano slowed his final nomination for the Supreme Court with at least one week and raised the question whether the Bureau's findings could cause some of the senators of the Republican party to withdraw their support.
In an interview, broadcast Sunday, the correspondent of "60 minutes" Scott Pelly asked the senators of the Republican John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I want to say, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
After the incident, I called him out and asked, “Did you do it? ”
He was determined, categorically and indifferent."
Gram's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion on Brett Cavano and to change it, a dissuasive charge is necessary," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret denied it categorically," Gram added, turning to Christine Blasy Ford.
"And no one she mentioned, but could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the “Global Citizens” festival, and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive composition of performers and also performs such an impressive mission: removing poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will gather tens of thousands of people of the great sea in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardie Bi and Sean Mendes, but will also meet the real goal of the event – removing the extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international protection group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (except if you do not want to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "actions" as a voluntary participation, sending no email to a world leader, calling the phone or connecting in another way to help raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is "Global citizen" 12 years before it reaches its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert a brilliant way to be convinced to demand action or is simply another case of so-called "clitivism" – people think that they do something important when they sign online petition or post on Twitter?
Since 2011, "Global citizen" has written more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, who insist on many different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to publish commitments and policies of more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and messages resulting from its actions, which have already been paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group believes that the funds already had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include "Food Force", established in the UK partnership between investors and performers, engagement with "helping children to develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda $35 million to help stop malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 posts on Twitter from "global citizens".
"With the support of Britain's government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a historical note," said Traci Ulman, a envoy of the Food Force, in front of the audience of a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions have been taken, which call on Britain to improve the feeding of mothers and children, the government has announced funding for the project, "The Power of Food", which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of his website's CZVs, asking, "Why do you think we can stop extreme poverty?"
"Global citizen" answers: This will be a long and difficult path – sometimes we will fail and we will fail again.
But as with the big civil rights movement and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardie Bi, Jeanelle Mona are just some of the performers of this year's event in New York, which will lead to Deborah-Lei Fernes and Hu Jackman.
The US can use military forces to "block" and prevent energy exports – the Minister of Interior
Washington may, if necessary, flee to its military forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering the markets, including the Middle East, as US Interior Minister Ryan Zink quoted Washington Examiner.
Zink claims that Russia's engagement in Syria – specifically where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, as they did in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to do so.
"The United States can, through our military forces, ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink addressed the presence of the consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, which is represented as a "voice of energy users" in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option for Iraq and Russia is, more or less, to stimulate and replace the fuel," he said, while at the same time defining Russia as "a pony with one number", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with increasing the exports of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project for the North Stream 2 pipeline, which according to Trump turns Berlin into a hostage.
Moscow stressed several times that the pipeline for $11 billion of the North Stream 2, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington’s project’s fire-fighting opposition is simply dictated for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the point of view, energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the German Industry Federation (DBDI), called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at the presidential nomination in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "look seriously" at the presidential candidacy after the mid-elections.
During a city council in Holioke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that I was considering applying.
"It's time for women to enter Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will look seriously at the presidential candidacy."
Warren expressed his opinion about President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he “led this country in the wrong direction.
"I am fighting to the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was exposed in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Cavano.
In a post on Twitter Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a sociological study conducted on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think that it should be applied for in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be nominated, according to the study of Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
Social research has shown more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the democratic party, discussed with regard to potential nomination in 2020, include former Vice President Joe Baiden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he was going to make an official decision in January, reported Associated Press.
Sara Palin referred the PTSR to Trak Palin at a meeting for Donald Trump
Trac Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after the September recording.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my own son goes through, after returning, is known to other families that feel the consequences of the PTR and some of the wounds that soldiers are coming to," she said before the audience of the meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they return a little changed, curved, return and wonder if they will receive this respect that they and their arms have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska and accused of assault and domestic violence against a woman, included in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of emergency, according to Dan Bennet, spokesperson for the police administration of Vasil.
18 states and districts Colombia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and county Colombia support the judicial dispute of a new US policy that rejects the refuge of victims of gangster and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from the 18th States and the county submitted a request for goodwill in Washington in support of the asylum seekers and questioning the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant for the Grey vs. Sessions case has not been disclosed, which the American Union for Civil Liberties filed against the federal policy in August.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of the cruel members of his gang" abused her, but US officials rejected the request for asylum on 20 July.
She's been detained in Texas.
The state lawyers who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers come to the United States, such as nations facing comprehensive gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US policy in the area of asylum returned the decision of the 2014 Appeals Council of the immigrants, which allowed immigrant documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District attorney Colombia Carl Rasin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires all asylum requests to be examined in accordance with specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle," the report of good will says.
In addition, lawyers claim in the report that the policy that refuses to join immigrants is damaging to the US economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work hand."
In June, Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration courts to stop providing asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gangster violence.
"Refugees are given to those who leave their country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political convictions," Sessions said in his statement of 11 July on politics.
The asylum has never been intended to alleviate all problems – not all of them – before which people face every day, anywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, while death cases are doubled during the search for survivors
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, calming her sick boy in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance carries more corpses.
The clean water is dirty."
The residents are told to return to their ruined homes to try to save something from their alleged possessions.
Hundreds of people are injured, and the patients injured by the earthquake with magnitude 7.5 are filled.
Some of the patients, including Two Harris, who had suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, were born outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated openly due to the ongoing secondary rabbits.
His eyes are filled with tears when he remembers how he felt the severe earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I think I was pushed into the destroyed wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to town with the family to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then I shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US envoy accuses China of "tourism" with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official newspaper in China released a four-page advertisement in a US daily for the mutual benefit of trade between the US and China, US envoy in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump called for a paid publication of China Daily at Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa – after accusing China of trying to get involved in the elections for the American Congress on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is attempting to interfere with the U.S. Congress's election, noted what US officials told Reuters that it is a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently participating in the escalating trade war, which equals import tariffs between countries.
According to US and China experts at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were intended to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which support the Republican Tromp Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a leading exporter of agricultural goods for China, said that Beijing had harassed US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Brandad writes in a comment in the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, "now doubles this brake by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the government of China enjoys the respected tradition of freedom of speech and the press in America, leaving a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"Despite this, you will find limited statements on a newspaper stand down here in Beijing, and you will not see a real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He adds that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish” his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With Kawano's crowd, the Republicans withdraw women's voters for inter-elections, warning analysts
As many of the high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend the nominations for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano regarding several charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that there would be a response, particularly from women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions around the roof are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue to vote.
These things can't be returned," said Grant Racher, professor of politicology at Maxwell University in Siracusa, in front of The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Racher said he doubted whether the recent insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) on the FBI's investigation would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karin Jean-Pier, senior adviser and national speaker for the progressing MoveOn group, according to Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning the protesters scandaled November! during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as the Republicans who control the judicial commission decided to continue with the nomination of Cavano despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasius Ford, Mic said.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," reported the news, Stu Rottenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"The people say that the problem is already serious; that is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among voters of women in the suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years, who often do not vote because they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public witness statements describing her allegations of sexual assault against the nomination of the Supreme Court, analysts assume that she can follow a response if the Republicans insist on confirmation of the candidacy.
"This has become a major mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Party, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee, the final vote, or whether Kawano is put on the scale. It's about how the Republicans deal with it and how they deal with it," said Gai Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that assists in the election of Democrats.
The Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided on the question of who to believe in following the demonstrations of Ford and Cavano, with a little more bending to the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford's statements, and 35 percent say they definitely believe in Cavano.
In addition, 38 per cent say that they believe that Cavano probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 per cent claim the same for Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, told The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath before the Senate's judicial commission that Cavano attacked her in a state of emergency when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals before her while they were at a party during her follow-up in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Burns-Lei starts a start that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a company that builds the platform with an open code of Burns-Lei Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burns-Lei, the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We need to do it now," he said about the start.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own online personal data storage or POD.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through every browser, and at the same time all of them at the same time.
The unique online personal data storage system is that the user determines who has access to the information.
The company calls it "give power to personal data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Burns-Lei, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers, a project work contract, and a group of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burns-Lei said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, or not, when all their business models are completely updated for one night.
"We don't want permission from them."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Burners-Lei wrote that the mission of Inrupt is to provide energy for trade and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Burners-Lei transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months, Burns-Lei has had a strong influence on the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Despite starting Inrupt, Burners-Lei will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era online," Burners-Ley added.
Bernard Van: In memory of the priest, honored with the cross Victoria during World War I
100 years have been observed in the home city of the only Anglican priest worthy of the cross Victoria for his participation in warfare during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van won the September 29, 1918 prize in the Bellengise and Lehaucourt attack.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without realizing that he was worthy of the highest military honors of Britain.
A memorial monument was discovered on Saturday by his two grandchildren on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years from his grandfather's work, decorated with a medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under a heavy fire of artillery and cartels."
Later, he attacked the fire line and, with “incredibly bravery, ” pushed forward before he attacked an artillery weapon with one hand and struck three of the crew.
Lieutenant Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, placed a wedding after a parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it is "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added "the virtue of the true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Peppa Pig
Imagine that all night long you are waiting to see a full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you cannot become witnesses to the main event.
The San Jose programme contained 13 doubles, including six of the base map and had to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock, just when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the audiences in the United Kingdom were shocked when the transmission changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed when they were built up to the early hours, especially due to the twins.
A fine description on Twitter of switching a child's animation film as "a kind of painful joke".
"The government regulates that this content is not appropriate at 6 p.m., so the programme was changed with child transmission," said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Bellator communications, in response to the issue of broadcasting.
"Peppa pig," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Koker said they would work on planning the meetings to include British audiences in the future.
"I think when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Koker said.
"There is, however, six mornings a week and there is no way to plan things so that the event will take place here on Sunday, and there – on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't that kind of government.
I can promise you this will not happen next time.
We will stick to the inclusion of five doubles instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to give more to the fans, but we crossed.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt "low" because of his sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Dale says he's grown up feeling lower than everyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started to study in high school, he did not realize that "not all are like me."
In an interview with the first edition of Desert Island Disks on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be less interested in winning the Olympics.
The permanent leader of the long-term show, Curtis Young, is in a hospital for a few months.
In his first program of Lavern Daily, he said he felt "less" than everyone else while he was growing up, as "it wasn't socially acceptable to like girls and boys."
He said: “To this day, the feeling of inferiority and the fact that I am different from others is, in fact, the things that give me energy and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that it was "something," he said, so I didn't disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic Bronze Medalist became an active participant in the LGBT campaigns and used its participation in the British Community Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he is happy that he can live openly, without consequences, and wants to inspire "hope" of others.
The three-time World Championship said that when he fell in love with a man – American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – he was “surprisingly surprised.”
Daley made a marriage to Oscar's carrier, who was 20 years older than him last year, but claimed that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much while you're so young," he participates for the first time in the 14th Olympic Games, and his father died three years later of cancer," he said, "it's hard to find someone of your age who has experienced such surges and falls."
Both became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley himself says "his whole peace has changed."
"If you had asked me last year, I'd tell you that I'd only be interested in winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was baptized by his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dale told me that his father couldn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked about is if they already have tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – since he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be with me, Dad, or in the first order," he said.
"I held his hand until I stopped breathing and at this moment when I realized that he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not harmless," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that I've been dreaming about it all my life – to jump to the Olympics in front of the audience at home. There was no more scary feeling," he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song – “Proud” by Heather Small – which accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still makes him stumble.
Desert Island Disks is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15, British summer time.
Michaelson's lost form remains on the "Rider Cup" scale on Saturday
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday, when he will play his 47th game at the "Rader Cup", but he will have to return his old form if he doesn't want his record to be connected to failure.
Mikelson, who took part in the two-year event for the record 12th time, was left on the scale of Captain Jim Furick for the "fourball" and "foursam" matches on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure in the U.S. team again, the five-time winner of major tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his blows away with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who, even at the top of his career, was never among the straightest players, was not in the best form for the difficult game of Le Golf National, where the long unbalanced terrain usually punishs every wrong hit.
And if the game itself is not worrying enough, on Sunday, the ninth match, Michaelson will face the exact champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who is in a team with new recruits, Tommy Flitoud, and they are trying to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who leave with four points before the 12th single match make a strong start, it might prove that Michaelson's sword is absolutely decisive.
Furick expressed confidence in his co-worker, although he could hardly say something much different.
"He fully understood his role today, slammed my back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"He's confident of himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Glory and has given as much as in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in just two games.
I expected to play more, but that's just how it worked, and we believe we've made the right decision.
He wants to be at the golf course and play, as well as everyone else."
Mikelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the most football in the "Rider Cup", played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career in Rider Cup, which has never been close to his impressive individual achievements.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 loses and seven equal matches, but Furick said his presence also brings other benefits to a team that don't measure with numbers.
"He's fun, sarcastic, resourceful, he likes to joke with people and he's a great man for every team," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives much more than that just to play."
Thomas Björn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the big front may soon be stopped.
Europe's team captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the great front, gathered before the singles of the last day of "Rader Cup", can be easily removed.
The datchan debuted in the game of Valderrama in 1997, when the team with Captain Seve Balisteros led five points in front of the Americans, but exactly on the final right was almost achieved and barely succeeded in winning with 141⁄2-131.2.
"You continue to remember that we had a big front of Valderrama; we had a big front of Brookline, where we lost, and Valderrama we won, but very difficult," Bjorn said, after the European team won the 5–3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, with which he took 10–6 of Le Golf National:.
So history has to show both me and everyone in the team that it's not all over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Get out and do what you need to do.
Nothing's done until you see the final result on the table.
We have a goal and it's to try to win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to stay focused on.
All the time, I repeat, I think only about the 12 players in our team, but we are also aware of our rivals, who are one of the biggest players in the world."
Satisfying the performance of the players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush with the holidays.
It'll be different tomorrow.
In the future, individual performances will come out, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when it's all right, but when you go out alone, then you're testing your entire capacity as a golfer.
This is the message that must reach players: tomorrow you must give the best of your own.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he has to give himself up to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, the captain of the rival Jim Furick will want his players to appear better individually than as partners, as exceptions are just Jordan Spyt and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
The Furik himself was on both sides of these great reverses in the last day – he was part of the triumph of Brookline, and then he was on the losing side when Europeans performed the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw Brookline, as well as Medinah.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate swords are played under tremendous pressure.
So we formed our composition and distributed our boys as we wanted to, so that we could try and do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with conducting our counterattack and facing Rory McKilroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitoud and Jan Polter will meet other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
"I chose these players in this row because I think this gives us the greatest chance of success," Bjorn said of his choice for singles.
Germany suspends the launch of a new warship
The German fleet's latest fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships since the Cold War, but this would not be achieved until at least next year due to the wrong systems and the head-of-the-end growth costs reported by local media.
The introduction into operation of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship of the brand new fragments of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted an army speaker.
The shipyard had to join the military forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, ordered by the fleet in 2007, will replace the old Bremen frigates.
We understand that they will have a powerful weapon, a set of air and anti-circuit missiles, as well as some sets of technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest brakes must be able to be used up to two years before returning to the port of residence.
However, continuous delays mean that advanced military ships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean – will already be old when they enter into operation, notes Die Zeit.
F125 crashed into the headline last year when the German fleet officially refused to release the shipyard into operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
It is little known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of essential "software and hardware defects", which make the warship useless if sent to a military mission.
The software deficiencies are particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg fleets will be run by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older crew of the Bremen class.
In addition, it appears that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the military forces to add future overhauls.
It is believed that the 7000-ton Rhineland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project – including equipment training – also becomes a problem.
It is estimated that it has reached the staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) - from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest freight are becoming particularly important in the light of the recent warnings that the German military forces are engaged.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, admitted that the fleet is in fact "exploited from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said that the problem had become bigger in time, as the old ships were made out of operation, but no new ones were provided.
He complains that no piece of Baden-Wuerttemberg class can be included in the fleet.
The National Trust Follows the Secret Life of the Stickers
A new study carried out in an apartment in the Scottish mountains aims to determine how the beauties use the landscape when hunting.
The hopes are that the discoveries will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying bats and will help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from Scotland's National Trust will often follow the stickers, as well as the brown-eyed waterlights at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations in the property to track the sticky activities during the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the call sounds of the stickers, as well as the types they publish.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Duar, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are the most important for the attractions and how they are used of every kind.
This information will help determine the benefits of the work on housing management, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for the sticky and other related species.
The populations of sticky in Scotland and in the United Kingdom have decreased significantly throughout the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to loss of habitats.
The risk to populations may be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, the stickers aren't blind.
However, because of their habits of night hunting, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use improved ecolocation techniques to absorb insects and obstacles to their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large-scale gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the approach very seriously.
Trust has trained experts who carry out regular investigations, asylum inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first in Scotland and the only special reserve for stickers in the Threeeve property in the Dumfries and Galway area, which is home to eight of the ten species stickers in Scotland.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a great area for the attractions," he noted.
"We have old buildings, very old trees and completed a suitable home.
But there are many more things about the beauties that are not known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to flourish."
He emphasises that it is important to check the availability of stickers before taking action to support property, as it is possible to destroy one refuge by killing up to 400 female and young stickers, as well as to destroy the entire local population.
The stickers are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, torture, torture or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferll, a Scottish servant in Trust for the preservation of the charms, encouraged society to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our beautiful and many of our animal species, because we just don’t know what’s going on with their populations.”
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of rape and his lawyers will trial a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo identified allegations of rape against him as "false news", saying that people "want to be known", using his name.
His lawyers will judge the German journal Der Spiegel, which publishes these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rape by American Katherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claims that after that he paid her $375 000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel announced on Friday.
In a video in Instagram, turning to its 142 million followers, a few hours after the 33-year-old Ronaldo published the publication as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is false news," the golden ball carrier told the camera five times.
"They want to become known by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to crowd out the popularity of my back, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," the footballer smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to judge Der Spiegel for the claims that they call "inadmissible publication of suspicions in the field of personal life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the footballer would seek a benefit for "moral damage in proportion to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
It is claimed that this incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino apartment in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the football room where they claimed he had raped her individually, according to the documents filed in the district court of Clark County in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the Ronaldo incident he fell on his knees and told her that he was a "good boy" of "99%", but in the case he just submitted to "one percent".
According to Ronaldo's documents, he confirmed they had sex, but that's what happened with her agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken to the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "feared by revenge" and worried that she would "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement, as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident.
At the time of the Ronaldo incident, he was on his way to join Real Madrid of Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for a sum of 100m euros.
Brexit: Britain "will regret forever", that it has lost car manufacturers
Britain "will regret forever", if it loses its status as a world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, the secretary for the business said, Greg Clarke.
He added that it is "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effect of delaying the border in the case of Brexit without a transaction could lead to loss of jobs.
In the factory in Burnaston, where models Auris and Avensis are produced, nearly 150 000 cars were manufactured last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our plant will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says they're going to close their mini-model factory in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks of the supply chain in the case of Brexit without a transaction.
Toyota's production line works on the "precisely time" principle, and the parts arrive at every 37 minutes from suppliers, both from the UK and from the EU, for cars manufactured by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a transaction on 29 March, there may be problems at the border, which the industry believes could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to wait more than one day to fill their inventory in the Darbisher plant, said by the company, and that's why the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's "shamatic" plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We need to have a deal. We want to conclude the best deal that will allow us, as we say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to take this opportunity," he said in the 4's Today program on BBC Radio.
"After the claims not only of Toyota, but also of other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to ensure successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot say how long production will be stopped, but in a longer term they warn that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Covalaris, a 24 - year - old worker in Burnaston who is the founder of the United States factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “I think that if these jobs go away, they will never return.
Government speaker said: "We have put in place an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
The most important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be "rested for another week", as he continues to fight for Supreme Court Brett Cavano, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who investigates the Russian intervention in the elections, the links between Tromp's assistants and Russia and the potential obstacle to the judiciary by the President.
This is whether Trump will fire the Deputy Chief Prosecutor, or not in this way threatens Mueller's independence, for months he's been feeding the rumors about Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times announced that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility to wear a microphone to record the talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the President through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was in the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced with him on Thursday.
Trump said he would "be preferring not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing before the Senate's legal commission, for which they both testified, as well as one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI of complaints against Cavano, even more delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It may be a week, but seeing all the other things happening in the Supreme Court, I think it can be postponed for the next week.
But we'll see, and I'm always trying to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would argue that Sanders did not hold a press conference from the White House on September 10th.
The lead of the transmission Chris Wallace asked for the reason.
Sanders rejected that rare press conferences were not due to the "demonstration behaviour" of television journalists, although he said, "I cannot say that I disagree with the fact that they have demonstration behavior."
Then she insisted that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The President holds more sessions with questions and answers from each president before him," she said, as she added, without quoting the evidence: "We have checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the US President, this is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it often, and you're witnesses to practice it quite often in the last few weeks, and this will replace press conferences once you have the opportunity to speak to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the President may show why, with his eccentric and at times strange behavior in front of the assembled journalists.
Minister of Health addressed EU workers in the National Health Service of Scotland with regard to the concerns related to Brexit
The Minister of Health addressed staff from the EU working in the National Health Service of Scotland in writing to express the country's appreciation and the desire to remain in their seats after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to the remaining less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to the costs of established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment continued, and decisions are expected in this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparations for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to remind you of how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
EU-wide colleagues contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is of benefit to the patients and communities I serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would like you to stay here."
Kristian Abercromby undergoes emergency surgery after having a head trauma
Tenesy State Tigers, Krischen Abercromby, suffers an emergency after receiving a head injury during a meeting Saturday, when his team lost Vanderbillt Comodors with 31-27, reported Mike's Tennessee Organ.
The senior coach at Tennessee State, Rod Reid, told reporters that the trauma happened just before the half-life.
"He went to the side line and somehow just fell there," Reid said.
Trainers and medical personnel submitted Abercromby's oxygen to the sideline before it was placed on the carrier and taken to the additional check box.
Tenesy State official confirmed in front of Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tenesy that Abercromby was out of surgery at the Vanderbillt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details of the nature/seriousness of the trauma", as well as that Tennessee State is trying to understand when the trauma occurred.
Abercromby, a second-class college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blocks before leaving the match, which makes a total of 18 blocks for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher wholesale charge when purchasing real estate in the UK
According to new plans of conservators, foreign buyers will be charged a higher charge on purchasing real estate in the UK, with additional funds to help homeless people.
This move will neutralize Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in herb tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The state haze expects an increase of over 120 million British pounds a year, which will help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today the foreign buyers' decision to pay a higher herb tax when purchasing real estate in the UK, as additional revenues will go to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more accessible housing and targeting people with high incomes.
The increase in herb tax will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, with additional incomes will help the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is an addition to the current herb tax, including the higher levels, introduced two years ago for second houses and properties purchased for the purpose of surrender – may amount to up to three percent.
The government's stock market is expected to increase by up to 120 million British pounds a year.
About 13% of the newly built buildings in London are purchased from people with citizenship outside the UK, leading to higher prices and making it difficult for people who buy property for the first time to invest in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “pristine cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers that spend most of the time abroad.
The new policy appears only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in herb tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by robbing the land, but not using it, and asked Ms. May to leave the quotas for accessible housing to repair the "warning with the homes" of Britain.
Mr Corbin has announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reform, including control of rentals and the end of the "free of wine".
He also wants to provide the councils with greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year I shared that I would like to devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not fair for people who do not live in Britain as well as for foreign companies to buy as easy a home as for those who work hard in Britain.
Too many people dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the isolation from sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead a team of Scotland"
Sanderland Manager Jack Ross said "the greatest ambition" in his career is to be the senior coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish accepted the challenge of re-establishing a club from northeastern England, which is currently in the third position in the First League, at three points from the first place.
He passed on to Stedium of Light this summer, after last season brought St. Miren back to Scotland's High League.
"I wanted to play for my family as a player.
I recorded a B team match, and that's all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportssound.
"But I grew up with the Battles of Scotland of Hampden, which as a child we watched with my father, so the national team always attracted me.
"This possibility, however, would only be opened if I had success at the club level."
Among Russia's predecessors as Sanderland's managers are the names of Dick Advokaat, David Moise, Sam Alardais, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kein, Gus Pojet and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloa Atletic's former teacher said he did not experience anxiety as an heir to such established names in such a well-known club, as he had previously rejected offers from Barnes and Ipsuic Town.
"For me, success will now be measured with a positive answer to the question "Can I return this club to the High League?"
Because by structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the High League," he said.
"It won't be easy to go back to the highest level of football, but I'll assume I've succeeded here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross has been a manager for only three years after spending some time as an assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months in Harts' training staff.
Then he helped Aloa not to fall into the Third Division and turned St. Miran from a winning team to a champion at the Championship next season.
Ross shares that he now feels more comfortable than his career as a footballer in Clyde, Hartlypull, Folkerk, St. Miron and Hamilton Academy.
"I was really on the cross," he recalls when he took Aloa.
"I really believed that being a manager is the best initiative for me, including before being an active player.
It sounded strange because I did well, made good money, and I had some significant success.
But playing is sometimes hard.
There's a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same stress and stress levels at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I've really done it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin for my whole conscious life."

The perfect time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, discovering research
Summer heat increases the income of fighters to survive British pubs, but adds more tension to the chain restaurants.
The groups of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the business-consultant CGA, who composed the statistics, said: “It has been a long time since England’s expected participation in the World Cup, in July, followed a similar model as in June when the public reported growth of 2.8%, but the restaurants received a stronger impact.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
The pubs and drinks bars reported the best results in their height compared to the lower movement of the restaurants.
Food pubs have also suffered from the sun, but not as much as the owners of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In the pubs and bars the sales of drinks jumped by 6.6 per cent per month, while in the food there was a 3 per cent drop."
Paul Newman, of RSM’s recreation and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we observed at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the services sector outside the home.
It is not surprising that the groups of the restaurants continue to suffer, although the decrease in sales by 4.8 per cent on an annual basis may be particularly painful in addition to the constant costs.
The long hot summer could not have appeared at a worse time for food plant managers and only time would show if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August would bring the desired rest."
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the expansion of the brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales analyst for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes data for the implementation of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion British pounds, and is a strong indicator in the industry.
One of five children hides their parents' secret profile in a social network
One of five children – some barely 11 – has a secret profile in a social network that hides from their parents and teachers, revealed research
Study conducted among 20,000 students from high school shows the growth of false Insta pages
The news raised fears that sexual material should be published
Twenty percent of students said that they have a "basic" profile that shows their parents
One of the five children – some of the 11 – creates a social network profile that keeps the adult secret.
A study of 20,000 high school students shows growth in false Insta accounts – a transfer to Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is published.
Twenty percent of students said that they have a clean "basic" profile that shows their parents, while at the same time they have secret profiles.
The mother, who came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, discovered a teenager who encouraged others to "violate him".
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40 per cent of children between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, with half of them recognizing that they keep their profiles secret.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "It is most important that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in Board of Light Athletics in Scotland
Elid Doyle was chosen to join the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland as director without executive functions of the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete, and President Ian Byit has set this move as a great opportunity for those leading to sport to benefit from her rich international experience over the past decade.
"Eilid is delighted to be highly respected in the light-attendant communities of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that the light-attack in Scotland will bring great benefits with its attraction," Biite said.
Doyle said: “I want to be the voice of the athletes and I really hope I can contribute and help promote sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won the finals of 200 and 400 metres of the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, adding to his total four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator at BBC, lost his ability to walk after receiving a transitional ischemic approach.
He wrote on Twitter: “I got hit a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show me how much I would recover.
It was an exhausting job, but I got a full recovery, I learned to walk again, and today I'm doing mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages."
Advertising for a cream pump that compares mothers to cows, divides online opinions
The company producing cream pumps splits online opinions with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to cows that come in.
In order to mark the launch of the expected "first insidious cream pump in the world suitable for wear", the consumer technology company Elvie released a cool music-video advertisement to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump allows the creamers to express themselves.
Four true mothers dance in a cow's lap, full of hay, on the background of a song with text, which includes: "Yes, I come, but you don't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed, that's not what we see, these are my breasts".
The song goes on: “Spring, pumping, feeding the babies, pumping, pumping, showering your friends. ”
The advertisement, however, published on the company's Facebook page, causes online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the clip received mixed reactions from the viewers, as many say it reduces the "fears" of the dairy processing industry.
"It is a very stupid decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and born to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
The feed pump Elvie collects discreetly in the feed material (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “We fully understand that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "So inadequate advertising."
Others defended the ad, as a woman admitted that she considered the song "extremely fun".
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy that if I'd still chewed.
Excitement made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little rough, but I accept it as it is.
This product is genius," someone wrote.
Another comment: “It’s a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who tend to move (often at their jobs or in the toilets) and feel like “breaths”.
It is not an advertising, praising or condemning the milk processing industry."
At the end of the clip, the group of women discovers that they were dancing with the discreet pumps placed in their essences.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who eat feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely idle, no wires or pipes and collects discreetly in the essence of the worms that give women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they're out.
Ana Balarin, partner and Executive Director at Mother, comments: “Elvie’s campaign is so revolutionary that it deserves bold and provocative marketing.
By drawing a parallel between the cream and the milk cows, we wanted to focus on cutting the cream and all the challenges associated with it, while showing more fun and understanding the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump falls into the leading news.
During the Fashion Week in London, two children’s mother appeared at a stage for designer Marta Jakobovski, using the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants have been secretly moved to the palace camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants jumped sharply, although the monthly crossings of the border remain relatively unchanged, in part because sharp rhetoric and politics by the Trump administration made it difficult for children to be found with insistents.
Usually most insistents are immigrants without documents that are afraid of risking their stay in the country if they want to recognise a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential employers and other adults of the family should provide fingerprints, as this data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albens, a high-ranking servant in the Immigration and Customs Service, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become advocates of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Approximately 80% of the persons who are either insistent or members of the family of the defendants are illegally resident in the country, most of whom are foreigners.
So we'll keep chasing these people," Albens said.
In order to deal with the registration of these children more quickly, the authorities imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear before a court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the previous rule, according to the reception officials.
Many appear in a video conference, not personally, to present their case for legal status before an immigration court.
Those who are defined as unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which may lead to violent riots or refugee attempts, according to the reception officials and reports that have been released from the system in recent months.
Lawyers have said that this concern has grown in large facilities, such as those in Tornilo, where the signs that some child has problems are likely to be ignored due to the size of the site.
They added that moving children to the "palatian city" without giving them enough time to prepare at an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends can make the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has lasted for eight years.
The museum, which also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign troops are illegally staying in Syrian territory under the pretext of combating terrorism and that "they will take the appropriate action".
"They must be removed immediately and without any conditions," he said to the congregation.
Mualem insisted that "war against terror is almost to its end" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been forced out of their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian countries are cleansed" as well as "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian members, opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military personnel in the countries devastated by the war.
As for the Mualem refugees, he said that the conditions are flexible and can be returned by accusing "some Western countries that "sweet out uninhabited fears", which encourage refugees to stand aside.
"We have encouraged the international community and humanitarian organisations to support these returns," he said.
"They're turning something into a political issue, which is a completely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid will not be provided for the restoration of Syria until it reaches a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
The UN diplomats said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major fortress of the rebels in Idlib gives an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a wide-ranging attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
However, the museum stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military actions would be directed towards the jihadists, including battles related to Al-Qaida's front "Al Nusra", which "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee, composed of members of the government and the opposition, in order to form a draft of the next Constitution of Syria and to conduct the way to the elections.
The museum outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "the review of members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump will win second term
On this basis, Trump will win a re-election in 2020, unless – as many liberals are likely to hope – his presidency will not be cut short in advance because of the impeccable and scandal.
That would certainly be "the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
At the moment, there's no sign of the eyelid's fatigue.
From 2014 onwards, the premium rating has increased by double to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during the premium, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show at MSNBC is at the top of a cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at evenings with big news.
"It's a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, an executive producer of ABC's drama "Last Candidate", where it speaks of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on Capital.
Nell Skowl, a veteran screenwriter and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club”, has another theory.
She remembers driving in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, "Why?"
Mrs. Skowl told me that he said to her, "Because she's laughing at me."
There's a party in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that is shown on television, Washington's stories can determine the future of Rou against Wade, whether immigrant families can gather again, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
However, the desire to inform a citizen does not correspond to this in six hours to watch a group of experts discuss Bob Udard, who uses "deep historical information" as a source of his book "Strah"; Paul Manafort's pilot jacket of extra-skin for $15,000 ( "drink full of arrogance" according to "Washington Post") and the striking descriptions of Stormy Daniels about Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he's doing to make you feel like part of the reality show is to give you a little each night," said Bernt Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, as regards the changing participants and daily calls (commitment with the National Football League, praise of Kim Chen Un).
You can't let yourself miss an episode because you're gonna stay.
When I contacted Mr. Flash this week, with him on the north coast of Kauai it was sunny, 80 degrees, but he was closed home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
It was impossible to separate itself from the television, especially when Brett Cavano had to stand before the Senate's legal commission and that depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we used to do all those rough lectures and people said, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Mr. Flash told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Investments are involved in the most controversial race in the early elections for a place in Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives a flow of money, thanks to the redeployment of the Congress districts and from there two titulars for the same place.
The recently redeployed districts in the Pittsburgh suburbs refer to conservative democracy Connor Lamb, who won his place from another district of partial elections last spring.
Lamb faces another titular, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is substantially represented by the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ordered in January that the old circles were anti-constitutionally manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the party's main funding institutions, the Democratic Congress Commission on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb went to Pennsylvania after the difficult victory in the widely debated partial elections in March for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The position was taken by the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political experts believe that democracy has a slight advantage.
The United States considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, after which it withdrew
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to withdraw the leaders of the diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "short decisions no longer to be recognized by Taiwan", said Heather Naurt earlier this month, spokesperson of the Department.
But sanctions were only provided against El Salvador, which in 2017 received around $140 million from America for the fight against drugs, with a view to development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including the imposition of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be punishable for the country in Central America with its unemployment and percentage of murders.
In advance of the internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which served to continue such a meeting last year, considered as a step forward in the efforts to prevent the flow from migrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior management authorities clarified their desire to hold the conference, thus effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pens announced he would attend the conference planned for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration attaches to the gathering, the diplomats say.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
The spokesperson of the White House for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who wanted to remain anonymous who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst, close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next step may be the report of Special Adviser Robert Muller on the possible impediment of Mr Trump's justice, as the report is currently a significant evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Muller is directing his investigation and whether Mr. Trump has been indicting Russia during his campaign in their attack on our elections.
If Congress' leadership changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to report to this body, exactly when he prepares to stand before the electors, and perhaps even before the court-martials made up of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I am not surprised that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – neither is it like him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make these choices that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to engage in a coup against Hitler, only the West had completed and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the following years on the clan.
The course of history depends on such moments, and the unwise course of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
At the moment, the Americans are facing a number of similar captures at the moment.
What if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to secretly write down the president and speculated that it was not appropriate for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein said the story in Times was incorrect.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Cavano, required by the FBI, is not complete or fair - or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite the allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And most of all, are we going to vote on the early elections for Congress if that forces Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for it for a long winter.
But I believe we're not going to fail because I've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, who was driven to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to burn the candles for Shabat on that table, wearing a satchel.
With an inheritance like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Gram Dorans of Rangers is an optimist for a collision with Rapid Vienna
Rangers are home to Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Vilareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move ahead of the G Group of the League of Europe.
Contusion in the knee did not allow semi-defense Gram Dorans to play his first match for the season before the 2-2 match in question with Villareal, but he believes that for Rangers this result can turn into a trampline to greater achievements.
"We've won an important point because Vilareal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old footballer said.
"We entered the match with hope that we could win something and left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the match, but as a whole equality seems fair.
They were better during the first half, and we were in the second half.
We've taken a look Thursday, another big night of our matches in Europe.
I hope we can fight for the three points, this will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I'm sure with the support of our audience we can give everything from ourselves and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely hard after everything that happened in my contusions and changes in the club, but now things seem to have gone in the direction of the rules.
The team's good, and the guys are really having fun, the training's useful.
I hope that we will make every effort to forget the past season and achieve the desired success."
Women are concerned about fears about their pension savings
Despite the fact that participants in the study had a clear idea of what concerns they want to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide study shared that they had discussed with their husbands the long-term care costs.
Only 10% of them talked to their children about it.
"The people want a family member to take care of them, but they have not taken steps to carry out this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not predetermine your wishes.
Together with your advisor and your family discuss where and how you want to get care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining the costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you with an idea of how to pay these expenses.
Your decisions, when you choose a long-term financial institution, can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, mixed life insurance policy with monetary value, to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your funds – if you have the money resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles early.
appoint a health care officer so that you have a certain trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes, if you cannot communicate.
Consider also the idea of a financial authority.
You can choose a trusted person who will make the financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs emergency medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Can you answer the questions about medicines and allergies?
Show these details in writing so that you are ready.
"This is not only about the financial aspect, but also about who the doctors will be," Martin asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan."

The police describe the shooting that took place around 02:30 a.m. British summer time as a "accident act".
The victim couldn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami, which struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced, expecting the number of dead to grow.
Because of the interrupted communications, aid organisations cannot receive information from the Regent Dongala, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude of the magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster in Palu.
Here are some basic facts about Pala and Dongala, located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulavesi, located at the end of a narrow beach line on the west coast of the island of Sulavesi, with a population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunamis were over.
Dongala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of the island of Sulavesi.
The Regency, which is less than the Province, is a population of approximately 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of the province of central Sulavesi, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
The acquisition of nickel is also important for the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian disaster recovery agency.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Cunami took over the western part of Dongala and in 1996, when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic "Tikocean Fire Ring" and is regularly surrounded by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and waves of tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong truce on the 26th December of the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra activates a wave of tsunamis that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias near the coasts of Sumatra.
2006: Trus with a magnitude of 6.8 killed the largest island in Indonesia, Java, by activating tsunamis that broke into the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Earthquake 7.6 hits near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquake with a magnitude 7.5 hits one of the Isles of Mentawa and activates a 10-metre wave of tsunamis that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Platko earthquake hit Pidi Jaya's Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people mentioned the devastations of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time, no tsunamis were activated, but more than 100 people were killed by broken buildings.
2018: Strong rabbits killed the tourist island Lombok in Indonesia, killed more than 500 people, most of whom from the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in a homeless state.
Sara Pilein's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
Trak Pailin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and a candidate for Vice President Sara Pailin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Pailin, a 29-year-old, from Wasil, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, interference in domestic violence reports and resistance to arrest, according to a report by the state police in Alaska published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when the known female gender tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Pailin is detained in the pre-retainment facility Mat-Su and under an unsecured guarantee of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he was declared "innocent, certainly", when he was asked to be beaten, the media reported.
Pailin is threatened by punishment for three Class A offences, which means he can be deprived of liberty for up to a year and pay the fine of $250,000.
He's also indicted in a class B breach, which is punishable with one day in prison and a fine of $2000.
This is not the first time that Pilein has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Pailin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being examined by the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence crimes and possession of weapons under the influence of infectious substances in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend says he hit her with a humour in her face.
Sarah Pailin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 when she linked her son’s aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died of an earthquake that devastated the Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
Earthquake of 7.5 caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication network is broken, expecting the number of dead to grow in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulavezi, north-east of the capital of Indonesia – Jakarta.
Social media are turning video that shows the moment of conflict.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palo when the wave of tsunamis swept the shore.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death sentence for suspects in a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York want a death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died – a rare death sentence, which has not been executed in the state of federal crime since 1953.
It is claimed that Saipov, 30 years old, used a truck hired by Home Depot to carry out the assassination in October of the bike near the West Side highway in the Manhattan Valley, as well as walking and cycling on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has killed eight victims and has caused serious bodily harm, according to the notification of death in connection with the death penalty claim filed in the South region of New York.
According to the court document and the two charges, they can end with a death sentence.
Seven weeks after the assassination, Saipov sent a 22-point indictment, including eight murder charges related to a rocket used by the federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of the IPS.
The attack required "serious planning and intention," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov was executed as "horrible, cruel and misleading".
"Syfulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries, harm and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lori Decad, Daran Drake, Ariel Urli, Ernan Felci and Alejandro Damian Panuko," the notice said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's last South District was looking for a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug addicts, but was subsequently sentenced to life sentence in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed on a federal case in New York was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a conspiracy sentence and spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed at the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek nationalist, did not show a sense of remorse during the days and months after the assassination, according to the court documents.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching IDIL videos on his phone, he claimed the indictment.
He also asked his hospital room to place the IDIL flag, they told the police.
He charges an innocent person with an indictment consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that "they are obviously disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence rather than a sentence for a guilt and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all affected," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team previously wanted the prosecutor's office not to want a death sentence.
Member of the Parliament of the Conservatives says NAYJEL FARAZ should lead negotiations on Brexit
Nigel Faraj was promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a protest at the conservatives' conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party stated that politicians should "be under pressure" – as one of the members of Teresa May's own party, he proposed to lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a conservative member, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "would have gone out so far", if Mr. Faraj was secretary on Brexit's issues.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faced to deal with the party's deep-separate lines was stressed by conservators supporting the remaining who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan "Checkers", despite the attacks by the supporting Brexit, the supporting remnants of the EU.
The allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite the hostile reactions and urge the Eurosceptics and the liberators to choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bon said in front of the protesters with the slogan "Exit means getting out" in Saulihel that he wants to "reject Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr Faraj had to share with the rest of us and that he had to get the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If it had been the beginning, we would have left so far," he said.
The Commissioner of Wellingboro added: "I support Brexit, but we must reject the "Checkers" plan.
Referring to his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be rude.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected the claim that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The understanding that the British have changed their opinion and want to remain is completely wrong".
The conservators’ representative Andrea Jenkins also participated in the meeting, sharing in front of the reporters: “I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists who actually went out on the street and really helped us be elected.
Please drop the "Checkers" and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs. May, she added: “Premiers keep their position when they keep their promises.”
Mr Faraj said at the meeting that politicians should be “in a position to feel pressure” if they intend to change the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to change Brexit and we're meeting here today to say, "We're not letting you get away with this."
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexit, feel pressure.
"We mobilize the army of the people of this country, who helped us win at Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, supporting remains passed through Birmingham before they held a two-hour meeting in the city center.
Activists' hats were raised by flags with "Conservators vs. Brexit", after the group started this weekend.
Leiberist Lord Adonis played with the conservators for the party's security issues when he found out at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all of Canada's technology and yet, for the smooth crossing of borders, free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren said he would "consider seriously" his candidacy for the president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that he would "consider seriously the opportunity to apply for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that the representative of the Massachusetts Democrats spoke of his future during a city council in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a constant critic of President Donald Trump, will apply for a re-election in November against the national representative of the Republic of Jeff Diell, who was the joint president of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It is at the centre of speculation that it can take the post of Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holiouk was her 36th meeting with voters in the village building after Trump entered the office.
One of the present asked her if she was planning to apply for the president.
Warren denied that it is time for women to go to Washington and repair our damaged government, which includes women at the top.
He was arrested for the death of Sims from LSU.
The Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was a suspect arrested on Friday when LSU basketball player Wade Sims was killed.
Baton Ruž's police department announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, a 20-year-old, during a press conference at 11:00 Eastern Time.
They posted a video from the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify the man that is seen on the footage.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
"Way Sims was shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade was involved in protecting his friend and being shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted he was at the scene, he had a gun, and he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a problem and detained in the arrest of the police department of the Eastern Baton Rouge.
A young man with 6′6′′, grew up in Baton Rož – Sims participated in 32 matches with 10 matches as a title last season and recorded on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches.
Grand Pri of Russia: Luis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after the team's instructions helped him win Sebastian Fetel
Ever since Walter Botas was first classified as Luis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
Booth made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two turns, allowing Fetel to attack his co-worker.
Fetel first made a pi-stop and let Hamilton deal with traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to getting out of the race.
Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next round and came out after Fetel, but Hamilton managed to beat him after a tuxedo and drive a rubber to the tire, which forced Ferrari's pilot with a desire to release the inside of the track to avoid punishment for an additional time, after he had already closed the way of his opponent with a dangerous double protective manoeuvre on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the rear lines of the starting row and was seven after the end of the first round.
Then he even ran a long time since he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly to beat Kimmy Ryconen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally, he entered a pit stop in the 44th round, but failed to insert enough in the next eight rounds and finally Raymond finished fourth.
It was a hard day since Walter did a great job all weekend and it turned out to be a real gentleman when he let me beat him.
The team has done an exceptional job to win the first two places on the podium," Hamilton said.
It was really a bad language in the body.
President Donald Trump played with Senator Diane Finestein on a rally Saturday for her claim that she had not circulated the letter from Christine Blaze Ford, who accused the applicant of Supreme Court Brett Kawano in a sexual affair.
During a conversation in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the demonstrations given by Ford before the Senate's legal commission, and instead commented on how the events in the Senate show that people are "bad and disgusting and dishonest".
"What can happen and the beauty that happens in the last few days in the Senate when you see anger when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting, and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publications and distribution, and they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you know?
Diane Pinestein, did she spread out of you?
Do you remember her answer... did you release a document - "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... no, we didn't spread," he added, imitating the senator.
Phenstein sent the letter with details about Ford's claims against Cavano in July, and it was distributed earlier in September – but Phenstein denied this distribution to have happened from her office.
"I didn't hide Ford's claims, I didn't spread her story," Phenstein told the commission, The Hill.
"She asked me to keep confidentiality and I kept confidentiality as she wished."
But her rejection was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday evening: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to protect the Supreme Court's applicant charged with sexual crimes against three women, the President stated that the Democrats use claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return power with all possible means.
Look at the dishonesty, the shame, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they have to run, to get back power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundy Scar 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundy.
Dandy Schar came back for a five-year-old loss in Elite League against Belfast Giants, winning a five-three-year-old tournament in Dundy on Saturday.
The Giants led a two-ball game early after Patrick Duyer and Francis Bowlier hit.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kauney were evenly equal to the housekeepers before Duyer restored the front of the Giants.
Francoa Bushar is equal to Dundy before the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen to confirm their victory.
This is the third victory in Elit League for the boys of Adam Kiff who got out of the bottom to win Dundy in Belfast on 2-1 Friday night.
That was the fourth clash between the opponents of this season, when the Giants won the previous three matches.
The blow that Duyer discovered the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendal McFaul's assistance, and then David Rutherford doubles his advance, assisting Bovilier four minutes later.
It was a strained start, Sullivan returned the hosts back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped to balance with the help of Kauni at 15:16.
Daire's trying to take the Giants before the first break, marking the second goal for the night at the end of the first half.
The housekeepers regrouped and Bushar rebalanced the odds with a powerful blow at the door at 27:37.
Kauni and Charles Corcoran united their efforts to help Nilsen to give Dandy's front for the first time at the end of the second half, by giving everything to him and confirming the victory of the team with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
Giants, who lost the last four matches of total five, meet as hostess Milton Kins for their next match on Friday.
The pilot of the plane died to make sure that hundreds of people on board the plane can escape an earthquake
A pilot of flights in Indonesia is praised as a hero after his death, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board has managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people died, and many are unaware of a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Sulavezi on Friday, triggering waves of tsunamis.
Strong secondary rabbits continued to defeat the area, and many were caught in a trap from the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Juprei Airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the track at the time, would be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided to crash.
He died in the hospital later.
Air Control spokesman, Indonesia, Johannes Sirate, said that this decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are cautioned that the number of deaths can reach thousands after the disaster response agency in the country has announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will increase, as many bodies are still under the fractures, and many people cannot reach it," said the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached six meters, devastated Pala, where there was a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the nurse brings more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
There's maturities everywhere in the mini-markets."
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Weidodo, arrived in Palo on Sunday and turned to the country's army: “Please work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?", inform CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was devastated by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini announced that a person is in ignorance after an aircraft crash in the lagoon
The aircraft that flew with a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific now reports that a person has been declared missing after earlier stated that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the sinking aircraft.
In a press release Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon they cannot contact a male passenger.
The airline added that they work together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find a man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Ships of local people helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuk Island.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the precise sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airlines and the U.S. military forces said the plane was late in the camp just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane was over the track.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims that the plane was very low.
"This is extremely nice," says Janes.
Janes tells us that he and the others have been able to cross through the deep to cross the water to reach the crash exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the stewards had panicked and shouted, as well as that he had suffered a mild headache.
The U.S. military forces tell us that sailors, repairing port nearby, also helped in the rescue operation, using an inflatable boat, to get people to the shore before the plane sinks into the depths of about 30 metres of water (100 feet).
Data from the Safety Aviation Network indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have been killed in flights registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyst exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor concluded his statement on Saturday in the retrial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulette from the U.S. Ministry of Justice witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phones records to collect the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Telis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roulette said he got data on the location of several mobile phones showing that Teleis was with Chambers on the night of her death, back to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the cops went to ask Sanford.
Sanfred stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town this day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck the same night, Sanford said that "this is a lie, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding is that Tellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
The cell phone records say they've only known each other in a week.
Roulette said that shortly after the death of Chambers Telis, he deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He removed her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is planned to begin with its concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be presented to the judges later that day.
The High Breed: What is a famous hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative opinions about the genre by performing his music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that the hip hop has turned away from its origin of political statements and involvement with social problems.

Another black guy?
A New Yorker judges a couple after a "racist" message was fired.
A New York bartender judges a couple for dismissal because of discrimination after receiving a wrong message sent by the mother who complains that she is "the other blacksmith".
The two deny that they are racists, making up the demand for "extension".
Linzi Plasko-Flixman, the mother of two children, was ridiculed when she learned that the new baby girl, Giselle Morris, was a blacksmith when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"Neeeeeeeeeeeeeee, RELATED THROUGHT," wrote in a text message to her husband's wife, Ms. Plasko-Flexman.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flexman was feeling "unscrupulous" and fired Mrs. Morris, saying that the former barbarist, who was an African-American, did not do her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reports New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for one working day after that sent home with a taxi.
Now Morris judges the couple for the dismissal, wanting the $350 a day for the six-month contract for which she was originally hired, even though she did not have a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't have to do that," she said before Post on Friday, adding "You're sure this is discrimination".
In response, the couple claimed that they were not racist, adding that the cessation of Morris’s employment was a reasonable act, since they feared that they would not be able to trust her after being tried.
"My wife sent something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco, a husband of Post, said.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you tried, even if it was a mistake?
You're a newborn?
Think about it."
In effect, she wants "extension", Plasko claims that his wife was born only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to attack someone in this condition?
It's not particularly nice," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still under review, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple in social networks, denying them their behavior and logic.
Padington's publishers were afraid that readers wouldn't feel connected to a talking bear, revealing a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yangel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, relates: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It's very fun now that we're aware of the great success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for BBC, before he was inspired to write the book for a little game game, would feel optimistic about any rejection of the book, adding that he met the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings", after his death last year.
With regard to Paddington, whom she describes as "an important member of our family", she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
"He was a very humble man and was not self-conceited," she said.
"But since you felt that Paddington was so real, it's like having a child that's achieved something: you're proud of it, even though it's not your job.
I think you've been taking up the Paddington's success somewhere this way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits of his own Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
After her daughter was disfellowshipped, she was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled to save her life.
"Now it kept ringing, to say that the situation is really bad, that it does not expect to survive," said Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called me to say that he would die in two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I told her, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
Her medications to maintain her heart slowly stop working and abandon her system.
She's gone a while ago, and that's how it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this is happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should've hung up."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz, who so far mourns the loss of her daughter, is on board the plane along with the other passengers who have no idea of the test she's going through.
"No one understood," she said.
"I had lifted my head and all the time my tears were covering.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Grieving women place cards to prevent suicides from bridge
Two women, lost their loved ones for suicide, try to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey put on a bridge in Wells with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old at the time, says that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him after the smile.
They've always said that his smile is tearing down every room."
However, he gave up his job before he left, and was in "a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that this will have some consequences."
Ms. Davis creates the cards, “to make people know who to go to and who to talk to, even to be a friend.
Do not keep silence – you must speak."
Mrs. Humphrey, a long-term friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her 15-year-old companion, shortly after his mother's death.
"He did not say that he felt depressed or depressed, or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his state.
He came to the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their presents, he didn't look at them or anything."
She said that it was a terrible trauma to them, but they had to do it: “This opens up a gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to move forward and fight."

Brett Cavano's future is under discussion after the FBI launches an investigation
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wants – research with limited duration and limited scope – perhaps we could unite our efforts," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the Commission would "distort" despite the alleged suprapartmental blockade.
Why didn't Mr. Cavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their desire is for the moment itself.
The preliminary elections are only after five weeks, on 6 November – if, as is expected, the Republicans do not appear well, they will seriously suffer their attempts to be elected their representative in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush called senators, inviting them to support Mr. Cavano, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pens to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea "decreasing" at Kim
South Korean legislator claims that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Beeong Sug, quoting data from the South Korean Union Ministry, said last year there were 1127 refugees, compared to 2706 in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, the tighter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts required by human smugglers, are key factors.
There's no official comment from Penyan.
Most of the refugees from the North eventually receive citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the illegal border at the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, and it passes easier than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), which divides the two roots.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, often forced to repatriate them.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still in war, have improved significantly over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Phanyan for talks focused on remaining in the nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Un in Singapore, where they agreed to work in common for the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident of our national security and, under these circumstances, there is no way we could be able to dissipate unilaterally first," Mr. Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Cavano "historic" and said it's not suitable for service in the Supreme Court
The minority leader at Congress Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kawano "historic" and said he was too unbalanced for service in the Supreme Court .
Pelosi comments this during an interview this Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"There was no way to think that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would call her "theory," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kawano's testimony before the Senate's legal commission on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected the claim that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Cavano was very emotional, at times he almost cried and felt when discussing his family and his academic years.
He also categorically condemned the democracies in the commission, calling it a "gross and coordinated attack on the personality", organised by liberals who were not satisfied that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that according to her testimony, Kawano's testimony proves that he is unable to work in the Supreme Court, since it has become clear that he is inflexible with the democratics.
"I think he himself has been disqualified from these claims and in the way in which he pursues the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi denied when asked if he would try to discredit Cavano if he was appointed and in case the Democrats receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say so – if he doesn’t tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he’s nowhere to enter not only the Supreme Court, but also the court in which he is now,” Pelosi said.
Now Kawano is a judge in the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, it is concerned about the potential decisions of Cavano with regard to the Health Care Act or the Rou v Wade case, since it is considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kawano avoided questions as to whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for an upright, perverse man to enter court and expect us to say, "Isn't it great," Pelosi concluded.
And women must be in charge.
This is a fundamental criticism, after months and years of bursting of anger, and she cannot accept it without crying.
"I cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinham told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I got a huge help from a woman who was a executive director somewhere who shared that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she was angry and crying, she said to her interviewer, "You might think I'm sad because she's crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just keeps going.
I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are allowed in the expression of anger, in part because they are misunderstood at first.
One of the clearest memories of my past work, in the office mainly with men, is how once, while I've been running out of utter anger, older than I am, a woman grabs me by the door – a freezing driver, from which I've always been a little scared – and she's got me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have done it to you."
Patrick Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an external relationship with the boat, called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider the idea of candidateing for the president herself.
"It wasn't a good idea," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"Now there were seven other candidates in the competition and the last thing they wanted to happen was to show up another one.
Someone called the situation "Snow and the Seven Dwarves".
Since she's late in the campaign, she's staying with the fundraiser and decides she won't stay in the race if she can't collect $2 million.
The battle is predestined to failure.
She realizes that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During his speech in which he states that he will not continue with an official campaign, she is the envy of so many feelings – thanks to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system, which makes it so difficult to collect money and you can turn to the voters, not to the delegates, as well as to anger against sexism that she felt.
"A man can think that I've got a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder how the media reacted.
"Someone can think that Kleinex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my record?
"She's crying?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Serve Beijing
The first fires in the US-China trade war were deafening and, while the battle is getting fast, one gap between the two countries will bring Beijing's long-term benefits, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning trap this year, placing key elements of China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation of the tension occurred this week with the new customs duties affecting production for 200 billion US dollars (150 billion British pounds) with an effective tax charge of half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Every time, Beijing withdrew with new customs duties by five to ten percent of American goods for $60 billion.
China has pledged to give up every US hit and soon the second largest global economy is not expected to ignore this.
To get Washington to give up means to submit to the demands, but to hold his head publicly before Washington will be too ashamed of Si Dzinpin, the president of China.
And yet, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure of trade war with the US can help China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that an accelerated political solution, both in Washington and Beijing, can create conditions for an economic crisis in one of the two countries, is in fact more dangerous than observers previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a scholar on Asia-related issues to the Expert Group Center for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister said
Syria announced that it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and requests for assistance in the reconstruction of the country devastated by the war for more than seven years.
In turn to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress we have in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas devastated by terrorists to restore them to their normal state.
Now there are all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily life and nutrition.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in restoring the devastated country.
But he stressed that no conditional assistance or assistance would be received from the countries that financed the rebels.
Europe beats the Rider Cup in Paris
The European team won the "Rider Cup" in 2018, winning the US team with a final score of 16.5 out of 10.5 of Le Golf National in the coast of Paris, France.
Thus, the United States has six other losses on European land and has not won the "Rader Cup" in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the champion crown to the tournament after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Björn reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Michaelson, who presented himself weakly during most of the tournament, sent his first hit on the 16th hole (with "pair" 3) in the water with which he lost his sword against the French Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari presented itself perfectly in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, reached a 5-0-0 balance since the competition took place in the current format after 1979.
American Jordan Spjet lost categorically with 5&4 players in the European team, located at the lowest place in the ranking – Torbørn Olesen of Denmark.
The world ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 of Ian Paulter from England, for which this is probably the last part of "Raider Cup".
Spain's Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight participation in the "Rader Cup", became a European with the most winning points in the tournament for all time, increasing its assets to 25.5 points this year.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't hold.
It was a tough year.
I'm extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing me.
I'm so glad I can lift the bath again.
The team is most important, and I am happy that I have been able to help," announced the excited Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He broadcasts the staff of his fellow citizen John Ram, who won the American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 singles on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud that I won Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play," 23-year-old Ram said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and his overall balance of "Rader Cup" is already 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the biggest players for all time, won 14 big titles – an indicator on which only Jack Niklaus retreats.
The U.S. team was experiencing difficulties throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf in every day of the tournament.
The U.S. team leader Jim Furick said after the disappointing performance of the team: “I was proud of these guys, they fought.
At one time this morning, we pressured a team of Europeans.
There was a battle.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players showed up very well.
We will regroup, discuss the important issues with the Association of U.S. Professional Golfers and our Committee on "Raider Cup" and we will only look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can keep your opponent's hat off.
We were just overcrowded."
New for Red Flood: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manuti and Sarasota
The latest report of the Committee on Fish and Wild Animals in Florida shows a fundamental reduction in red flux concentrations in Tampa Bay areas.
According to the Committee, there are reports of conditions for growth decline in the areas of Pinelas, Manuti, Sarasota, Charlotte and Kolier districts – this shows a decrease in concentrations.
The waters with an excessive colour of red tide spread to approximately 130 miles on the coast, from the northern Pinelas District to the southern Leigh District.
Some of the waters can be seen 10 miles from the shore of Hillsboro County, but they're less than last week.
Red tides are also observed in Pasco County.
Over the past week, there has been evidence of moderate concentrations in the coastal zone or a little less inland in the district of Pinelas, low to high concentrations on the coast of the district of Hilsboro, assumptions for high concentrations in the county of Manotti, assumptions for high concentrations on the coast or below in the district of Sarasota, assumptions for moderate concentrations in the county of Charlotte, assumptions for high concentrations on the coast or below in the county of Leigh, and low concentrations in the county of Kolir.
They continue to receive information about the inflammation of the respiratory tract in the districts of Pinelas, Manuti, Sarasota, Lee and Kolier.
There have been no reports of inflammation of the respiratory tract in northwestern Florida in the past week.
