The right-wing populist triumph in Austria, together, has 29 per cent
Citizen weakenings both sides of today's major coalitions and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought, according to the first preliminary results of the Sunday early parliamentary elections in Austria.
In particular, strong losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (ODP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer has been seriously exacerbated.
On the contrary, the election leader Swazu for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Croatian Heitman Jörg Haider is seeking a triumphal return to national politics.
According to the preliminary findings, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest side of the country, with 29.8 per cent of the votes against the last 2006 elections, but losing 5.5 per cent of the votes.
Even worse was the loss of GDP by 25.6 per cent of the vote.
These are the worst results of both of these major parties in the history of the Russian armed forces, and especially of the people who made the early elections, it is a catastrophic result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the GSP came out of the coalition, people in preference to SPÖ had a significant impact.
However, the voters were apparently persecuted for letting the government go to waste.
In the first reactions to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of the president and current Vice-Chairman Wilhelm Molterer has already been reported.
The observers consider that this could be done by Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Presidency of the Party.
Such development would probably facilitate the journey to the most likely outcome of the election, namely the restoration of the large SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
In view of the strengthening of both the right-wing populist parties - the free movement (FPÖ) had already gained 18 per cent and the 11 per cent of the BZÖ vote - social democrats also expressed concerns about the resumption of 1999, when people agreed with the populists (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 the BZÖ withdrew) to the common government, which even called for sanctions from the European Union.
This development is clearly agreed upon by Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and proposes to return to Vienna to national policy.
The Green Party has yet to reach Parliament, but it has lost easily and has fallen among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
None of the other parties clearly exceeded the four-percent threshold and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Uztahy with India can be cooled
If a problem could not be solved with the Czech scientists who were accused of illegal brooching in India, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg, there would be certain cooling of Czech-India relations.
The minister introduced this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian rival Pranábe Mukherdze.
"If it did not work out, then yes, then some cooling would happen," he noted after a meeting that took place from the Czech initiative.
Mukherdzi said after the discussion that in judicial matters, the executive can be very difficult to deal with.
However, he stated that in the case of Peter Svácha, who was acquitted and subjected to torture, the central government may deal with the local government in Dardjiling, where the matter falls under jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučer, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be the best thing for Mukherdzi to appeal to the higher court.
Then he could ask for bail and wait for a sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that he also spoke to his partner during the discussion.
"It recommends the appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to forgive him," said the Czech diplomat chief.
The only way the Czech party can intervene in the whole of the matter is to provide the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance was already provided by the Indian side.
"We are most interested in maintaining the best relations with India that have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as the CHK said, in front of his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic poses a major challenge to Czech entomologists.
"We really encourage the deep miscarriage and regret of these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister avoided the answer to the question of whether he had received a commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I've already got enough promises," he just said.
Czech Judge Fighting the Seabed
It will come to a walled electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent maritime areas are represented.
But he doesn't care about the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it and the adjacent seabed.
The area is, however, great as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosooso, who is part of the thirty-year team of UN Division of Oceans and Maritime Law.
His boss, the head of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, is watching the lecture and sometimes adds.
He'll rule the work elan and the enthusiasm.
The bottom of the sea hides a little familiar world, rich in natural resources.
There can be oil, minerals and other non-growth raw materials, but also unknown living organisms that have a key to develop cancer medicine.
Bottom greater than the bottom
Today, coastal States have begun to hold on to new sub-areas.
According to the United Nations Convention, they therefore exercise their rights agreed in 1982 in Monte Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a hundred kilometers from the shore of the country.
According to the Convention, it has an exclusive claim to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simply taken, this part of the seabed and its base is part of the continental shelf, which is the natural continuation of the continent below the sea.
It goes beyond the border of the coastal sea, often even beyond the border of two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the definition of external borders of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a comprehensive scientific documentation based on many cost-effective surveys and measurements.
It's the result of a number of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only three countries have succeeded," says Mikulka.
World advertising has recently seen Australia's success, which, as the first, has significantly expanded its sub-Saharan countries.
However, he also obtained New Zealand - the seabed that the Commission granted him last week is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
Their future profit from using the seabed will be priceless, as they promise.
It shall submit its requests gradually to other States.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the Monte Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area begins, the convention declared to be the "joint heritage of humanity".
There's no state here anymore.
The right of action in this area shall be granted by a convention established by an international institution.
"The bottom of the sea, but there is no Clondajak," says chief Mikulka in essence, saying that his "single areas are legally defined and their regime is legally protected."
Czech in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other countries of some eastern block within the framework of the Interoceanmetal Joint Organisation.
In 1991, it was awarded under the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, the status of a "pro-per-investant investor".
He has the authority to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, lying between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area under investigation by the investor is much bigger than the former Czechoslovakian.
The bottom is a member, it's some kind of underwater replica of Tater.
"It can be located on the surface of a total range of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich location of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan," another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan, states.
Macedonian worker Rober Sandev brings up one such particular.
He remembers a little potato or, in a little fantasy, a beautiful one that, according to legend, revived Golem.
Germany's special deployment units were at the time of the release of arms
The Egyptian government has asked for the help of the experts in resolving the crisis with arms.
When the situation was over, the special units were ready, however, to be put in place.
Further details are gradually available to the public on the circumstances of the liberation of eleven in Egypt of European tourists who have been kidnapped.
According to the data from the Ministry of Defence and inside, German forces were directly involved.
According to the statement of the ministries, there were at the site of release of both Spolska army experts and members of the anti-terrorism group of the German Police GSG9, the Flying Police, the Spolko Criminal Office, and also experts in the logistics of the Technical Assistance Service (Technische Hilfswerk).
According to another statement by the two ministries on Monday afternoon, however, German forces were not required because the prisoners left their prisoners to go and flee when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Government of Egypt accepted the aid offered by Germany as support for local action.
"There was no luck in that," said one of the speakers of the Ministry of Social Affairs inside.
The attackers took a group of passengers composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanians, and also eight their Egyptian guides on 19 September in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in the desert area of southern Egypt, the border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad were moved.
The identity of the abductions has remained unclear for the last time, as well as details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
Currently, there are preservations in Kahir.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of the hostages is in the care of the German Embassy.
He didn't show up for the details of the release.
In Berlin, information is still not available when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the "Build" list, all five tourists should also, with special forces, fly off one of the Airbuses of Germany and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. Snow Representatives Rejected Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has had a close majority drop in the savings package for the financial markets worth $700 billion.
The Dow Jones index has gone down a lot.
In terms of 206 to 227 votes, the United States of America rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians, the majority of the parties have not found a programme to alleviate the financial market chaos.
With dramatic action, the supporters were desperate to convince the critics of the package worth $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called for a vote before the MP to vote, even though, as he said, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason was the concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index was raised so that after notification of the expiry of the package, it would fall again.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulences on international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to approve the Snow House of Representatives and the Senate.
Travel agents record increasing booking numbers
It seems that winter will be good for German travellers:
According to one study, he increased in the booking of trips for the next month in comparison with the previous year - in the winter season even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic growth, the taste of German travel remains unencumbered.
In the winter season, the travel agents recorded a 31% increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as Germany’s Travel Association (DRV) stated in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK market research institute, increased bookings have been made available for the following months.
Thus, according to the RDV statement, the turnover was approximately 11 per cent higher than in 2007.
The basis for these results is the GfK numbers, which each month evaluates data on reservations from 1200 German travel offices and interpolates them on the whole market.
As a result, the bookings of the flights that took place by the end of August 2008 were included.
Due to the low dollar rate, they are requested mainly to travel to the United States, the DRV said.
These routes increase the reservation by about one third.
In addition, the aims of Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic water, are particularly sought in Germany.
In particular, organised trains are in the course, DrV President Klaus Laepple said.
In view of the rising energy and food expenditures, there are "costs for the customer that can be calculated rather than for individually organised holidays".
Laepple explained that money can save consumers, inter alia, by using discounts for temporary booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was very good, so compared to the previous year, it will again be a higher turnout - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip declined compared to the previous year.
My first October party
A dodeconic remixed pipe, a beer from the tubules and prominents in the roofs of known designers.
First on a beer pot.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV moderator and she's wearing a narrow roof.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is from a secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes on the beer shop, and the photographers are already throwing on us, and the drums are full of memory cards - it bothers me, for I'm at the Oktoberfest first.
This is how you can make friends.
My cheap roof seems to have fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the Clopasian equator, and so my sense of comfort in the circuit was more limited.
But right after coming to Theresienwiese, everything's better than it seemed.
Nearly everyone wears a woman's shirt or leather pants; no one looks down or shamelessly touched - everything is completely normal.
The special views of the banana stand in the chocolate are just my shield.
One Mnichovanka reminds me that I mistook her, "You're free, in the middle of the lady, right, left, right, left and right."
They're going to take a walk down the back of the left.
"Okay," he says and smiles.
The others with subtle flirting techniques don't get that much fun and they have simple stuffed hats on them with the title "This drink to get dressed!" and sprinkle on the round-up ass.
A young man with such displayist tendencies is called Bob, who came from England and at Octoberfest, too.
He's like gorgeous, with a long "oh."
It'll tell me after he's just got his husband drunk.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks they're garbage.
So Bob's one of the scared Wildbieslers, as in Bavaria, it's said to the public that we're going to drown.
The rest of the luck is to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, they run around the area where Oktoberfest is taking place, a bunch of health professionals who need to take care of the skyscrapers.
The doctors always show up in the Heines - in four wears a hidden vest from the apartment to the apartment.
They work like most of the visitors of the beer shop: empty there, full back.
Who's lying under the skin of this miscarriage is not visible.
"It's just the ones who can't go on anymore," she calls me in answer to my question one of the doctors and disappears in the dust.
Police have published the name of the victim of the accident
The name of the 30-year-old woman who died in the hospital after she was hit by a car in Essex was published.
The accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon reached Carole Paulson from the darkest Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to Queen's Hospital in Romeford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 19-year-old man was detained for suspecting an unintended ride.
He's already been released to the police bail.
Turkish diplomatic views are expanding
Long before Turkey began its efforts to enter the European Union, they wanted European powers to penetrate deep into the Turkish border.
On the east coast of Bospor, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, is one of the best memories of this unsuccessful imperial ambition.
The Hydarpaš railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a non-renewal form.
Then they'll tell you the tourist guide.
The building is situated at the end of the tower at every corner of the tower, in view of the non-recognition of some provincial German council.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But as soon as a person gets inside a carved treasure, he can no longer have doubts about the size of the company whose most Western port of the station was.
The station opened in August 1908 the German consortium of Anatoli-Bagdadian Corporation.
Germany, which was involved in the empire at a late stage, intended to carry out its ambition to control the Middle East by means of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and further on the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperial ambitions grew during the first world war.
Their colleagues were attacked by Lawrence from Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from surrounding areas, caused by frozen borders of cold war, is away
The British and colonial units were proceeding from Egypt and were pushing Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And the Hydarpash station also got bad news.
In 1917, the explosion of the military train destroyed its manufactured roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, she's been a bit of a slut and history has been around her.
Today, however, this gate to Anatolia continues to serve - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding images of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling party Justice and Development - AKP - created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from surrounding areas, caused by frozen borders of cold war, is gone.
The new policy is now being applied - Turkey is committed.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government has a good relationship with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I landed on the night train in the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I had to meet with one of the leading AKP experts for foreign policy, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a karate ride after the wheels, which reminded the ancient rhythms of the famous document Night Post, I arrived at the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for secular states, which wants to turn back to its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamic roots, represents the paradigm of Turkish consensus.
In the West, she raised suspicions, especially in Washington.
Taxi brought me to the AKP headquarters, ultra-modern stone and metal building, intentionally built in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-storey houses and power shops, where middle managers in business clothes - men and women - meet to do the early business.
Suat Kiniclioglu could be a moderate policy from almost every other European political party.
Sake, tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate environment.
The Cold War was anomaly," he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its border.
Today he has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
He had to do both.
"But it will certainly come a moment," I asked, "when might Turkey have to decide?"
"Turecko," he said, "didn't want it to come to such a decision."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost in memory: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea are just as prosperous Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, follow these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpaš station, after the next vast majority of the night, I thought of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who were watching how this building was built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found out that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, in a substantial part, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting at the port for the ferry back through Bospor, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "a sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt that the continent should have a claim on this fascinating country.
Memorable lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrolog, September 11th) had a Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and a congregation.
As part of the periodic music plan, he founded the year on the excellent Youth Proteus collection.
He was supposed to be 21 years old, but at the time that Proteus was singing last in 1979, there were almost 30 of us - we simply refused to give up the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape changer) represented the will and the ability of the congregation to go to any music that was presented to him - whether Madrigai or Messian, whether alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young congregation was often awe - inspiring, always inspiring, and all because of the inspiration of the only man and enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchanged all the time.
How often did Todd just tell us to "let the music speak for ourselves"?
He said, "The treasurer knows what he wants.
It's all in that music.
So sing it!"
His tactics were quite clear and precise, but she was neither dictatorial nor flowering.
No matter where the music standard was, he's always picked it up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a conductor was supposed to be fit in a knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when he was directed by the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I have reviewed over 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed - and I have been inspired many times.
Todd Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the leaders who, according to his words, simply "trapped one or two protruding pecks around the world."
We're gonna miss a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrologist William Woodruff (September 25th) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and also studied at BSc, MA and PhD".
This comes from Woodruff's note by the author in Beyond Nab End, but that's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and then he did a dissertation work on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and in 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff went through this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resiny "Flamenco and Life", because his documentary black-white photographs are amazing.
I was guided by the simplicity and strength of the action of the spectators and by their consideration and respect for the photographers.
A show that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino can catch magical moments."
The second Honda attacks with its bestseller
In November, Honda's second generation of jazz models are being sold.
If the front of this single-space vehicle has already had a significant space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
To this end, improved engines are connected that increase the comfort of the ride and allow greater fuel savings.
Evolution is more than revolution.
That's the second generation of Hondy Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, many changes have occurred on this one-space vehicle.
You should mention, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we examine the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz is coming on the market six years after the first generation was introduced.
So the first thing we're going to notice is the fact that Honda needed to cool down this model for a shorter period than other producers.
Although Jazz is a less known model in Europe, in other markets it became a phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, the country where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
In Japan, almost a million pieces have been sold since Hondy Jazz was placed on the market.
The second market became an old continent with about half a million pieces sold in six years.
The Honda, however, sets itself a goal to increase sales in its category.
Thus, while this Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 pieces of Hondy Jazz in 2007, in 2009 the estimates are estimated to be 100 000 cars, which would increase by 17% in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda sold a total of 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model, which means 6,7 % of the total sales of Hondy in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of Jazz, the Spanish branch is expected to sell 2,000 pieces a year.
The exact arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honduras to significantly reduce the decline in sales in Spain.
Car driving thus de facto expects to be combined with a total number of 22,000 pieces sold, which means 4 000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16 %.
Honda also increased its share in the Spanish market by 1,8 %, compared to 1,6 % of last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this part, Honda depends on the success of his next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-dimensional hybrid of compact size with a length of 4,37 meters, from which the Japanese company promises to sell around 200,000 pieces a year.
In the case of markets, 50 % of the Japanese producer's estimates are sold to Insight in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the old continent and Japan.
The start of the sale of Hondy Insight is expected in the first months of next year as soon as the public is represented in Valencia in January.
On the contrary, the first generation of new Jazz has increased all sizes.
Its length was up to 3.9 meters (five centimeters higher), a width of 1.69 meters (two centimeters higher) and a repair development of 2.5 meters, which means a length of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
Increased dimensions have also increased the internal space.
However, these benefits were achieved by using a new platform, but by putting the fuel tank in the middle of the vehicle that was already used in the previous Hondy Jazz.
Also, the volume of the storage space - which has a double bottom system - increased by up to 399 liters, by 19 litres more than the volume of the storage space in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are available in the engine version 1.4, because the volume of the storage space at Hondy Jazz 1.2 makes 379 litres.
The further improvement in addition to external elements - such as rear LED lights or the possibility of equipped with a polished panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seat.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow the angle to open 80 degrees against 67 in the first Jazz model.
The second generation of Hondy Jazz has new engines.
From the beginning, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which enables lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and brings excellent improvement of the combustion system at the same time as the high current at full engine speed.
The first engine with a volume of 1,2 litres has 90 horse performance at 6,000 wheels with a maximum torque 114 Nm at 4,900 wheels.
This engine - which was used by the previous generation of Jazz 78 horses - has a consumption of 5.3 litres and a emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Against the previous engine, which had reached 83 horses in the previous generation, will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horse performance has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and emissions 128 grams of CO2.
"Cars" prohibits collisions
Nissan has this time inspired nature, specifically in the hives, to progress in the development of anti-accident technologies.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the pattern of flying the rabbits, and thus prohibits collisions.
This is the bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in the prevention technologies of collisions.
The engineers of the Center for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. robot developed the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo in collaboration with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technological Research.
According to Kazuhira Doie, the Director-General of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Tag Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the four Nissan security shield zones.
The robot is intended to enhance the ability to prevent collisions on the vehicles of this brand.
During the summer, each rabbit creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the safety shield of Nissan.
However, the most important are the complex eyes that are able to see in all directions at a angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing to fly in their personal space without stopping.
The engineers designed what they called the laser tracker (Laser Range Finder) when creating this visual function.
It shall record the obstacles which are up to two metres in the distance of 180 degrees before BR23C, calculate the distance of the object concerned and send a signal to the ship's microprocessor, which shall immediately be warned against collisions.
"At a time when the obstacle is recorded, the robot will in turn aim towards movement and immediately change the direction of the circle into a right or even larger angle to prevent the collision.
The greatest difference to any existing system is the fact that all deviant manoeuvres are purely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
The robot cannot move upward or downward direction or diagonally, its movement is limited only to two dimensions and to a direction which is enabled by the rotation of its circle, but not in an infinite amount of directions and possibilities as with the wheel.
Therefore, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent the impact of the robot.
"The device only needs to process information every few seconds and according to these data to be kept.
It does not require the storage of information or logical intuitions from previous manoeuvres, which can work without interruption with only two toctotes of memory.
It may surprise you, but we don't talk about giga or mega at memory."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies, the immediate prevention of collisions, the technology Nissan predicts the use of serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the construction of a unit in the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the target and avoid obstacles on the way.
Enjoy your fear before you take the mortgage
It should be recognised that the US Ministry of Finance, in addition to having sufficient capital to deliver injections, is not lacking in the invention.
Faced with a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages at a bank with questionable solvency, it created a popular-scientific "Bad Credit Hotel" game on the Internet.
I don't like "The Hotel of Bad Credits"... or a complex hotel.
The hotel and its receptions, in particular, look foolish to a person once, twice, and three times to think about whether it is the right time to ask for credit.
And then above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
In fact, the game contains useful information, even if you are not too detailed.
It's a site that's more suitable for young people than space for the whole public.
What happens when the game ends?
There's a room of dreams in the hotel.
At least something, because I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital MUFG
The bank house Morgan Stanley announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank that spends nine billion dollars to get 21% of its capital.
A week after they found their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was planning to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a single price of $25.25, representing a total amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the accounting value of the securities by 31 August.
The MFG bank invests another six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% profit and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley made it clear that the whole operation would be carried out on the basis of an average single price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28 % under its current course.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% and got around $13.07 in greenwich time.
"This strategic combination represents an important opportunity on the way to speed up the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of banking holding," explained John Mack, Director-General of this American group.
The new statute adopted Morgan Stanley last week, which is intended to enable him to distinguish his activities, but it also places it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His association with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis requires the biggest essay from Wall Street to engage in a far more careful approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday, inter alia, show that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that he sells up to 20 % of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"We thought a week ago," explained Toki Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of the MUFG, "that our participation will consist exclusively of ordinary actions.
However, given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to limit the risk to a minimum and also to cover."
On the basis of the weighted average prices, MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley's valuable papers by 7 % less than their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a reduction in the share profit by about 20 %.
The agreement provides that the MFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares per year if the latter are last appointed to be changed at a price of 50 % higher than the exchange price, i.e. about $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital that will be brought to MUFG enables him to use investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the language groups refused to provide explicit information on the strategic projects of both new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to measure the payment capacity of Tier One around 15%, which is one of the best in the sector.
Morgan made it clear that since the end of August, "citizenally" had reduced his balance sheet.
For the last weeks, the group was demanding as its stock exchange rate fell by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payment linked to the long-term growth.
On Monday, these costs were the opposite of development, but remained high, about 12 %.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" from the big investment bank Wall Street on the coast of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merril Lynch, announced that she had selected $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-establishing the republic around socialism in the twenty-first century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third appointed speaker submitted to the vote, following the pattern of his opponents and friends, the proposal of the new Constitution.
And his mission was fulfilled, because 64% of the votes, according to the official results covering 80% of the votes, voted in the "yes" referendum.
"No" according to these results was 28%, 7% of the votes were void and 0.7% of the votes were void.
To accept the proposal of the Constitution, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two investigations carried out on the exit from the polling stations and the calculation of the non-governmental organisation predicted a clear victory on Sunday, with a range of 63% to 70%.
The rest of the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his proposal of the Constitution.
"The institution won the whole race," assured and congratulated Ecuadorians at the government headquarters of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers south-west of Quita.
They understand themselves that Rafael Correa was blessed by Chavez and Morales, but also by his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was held in peace under the observation mission of the Organization of States of America (OEA), referred to the text on 444 points of "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The proposal of the Constitution places the power of the State over the economy by replacing it with the "development planning" of a country that is primarily concerned with oil by foreign companies and the currency that its migrants send.
The proposal by Correou, who was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of the State, which will be able to perform two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the snowflake.
Correa has already announced that this power will be used and will be charged with a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution, among other things, confirms the principle of free health and education, which the President has begun to introduce in the country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also counts as a ban on the presence of foreign armies, ending the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuadorian base as the starting point of US drug operations.
19 hands were released in Chad
The Egyptian team attacked eleven tourists and their austere escorts, which were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who had been detained in the desert for ten days, were transported alive and healthy on Monday to the Egyptian capital.
During the morning, an Egyptian command was released in Chad.
Handimans flew around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base, closely adjacent to the international airport in Cairo.
They were immediately transferred without having the opportunity to express themselves in the press, on board the helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, the district resident of Kahiry to be detailed with medical examinations.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the prisoners," Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zojehr Garran said on the train route.
Since 19 September, during the safari in a vehicle with all four rounds on the slopes of Mount Uanat, on the coasts of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of handcuffs have been drawn from one hiding place to the other 35 unknown kidnappings.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanians - and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one foreign director of the agency Aegyptous, organizers of safari.
A leading Egyptian security officer pointed out that 30 members of the special units, who approached the site on board by two helicopters, had left just before dawn during the night.
"There was a shooting, half the kidnappings were killed and the others fled," said this source, who wanted to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "blesk" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from the German and Italian teams.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini from Belgrade, where he is located, referred to the role played by secret agents and Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professional and efficient people of our secret services, the special forces," he said without any further clarification.
He also denied that it would be paid off.
On the night before, the Sudanese army declared that the guard had kept a vehicle running all four rounds, on which the prisoners were on board, killing six of them, including the Chadian commander and two of them.
The army claimed that they were linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which immediately refused.
Letters - Most quiet cultural resort
The debate on the financing of culture fills the pages with new thumb headlines and is the theme of the pre-election campaign.
That's better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still obliterated.
Who will rise to cleanse the poor sums provided by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national monuments that are hungry?
Which policy dares to remind the federal government that they remember their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we don't have laws that would really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros on the restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage should be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all national organisations, and so on.
In Quebec, in the federation of Québec history companies, at least 40,000 volunteers combined to 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogicals on the discovery of history, the preservation of the collection of private archives and the protection of archaeological remains for a few small ones.
Often these companies are watching the dogs of our memories, who are driven hopelessly protesting when promoters and leading actors release their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten graves.
When do we finally meet the history and memory courts?
The government of Benelux is a member of the Fortis Bank
The Belgian and Dutch banks of Fortis will be assisted by the States of Benelux, which, as the first in Europe, has been in difficulty because of the widespread impact of the US mortgage market crisis, partial suspension: the three countries will support the monetary and insurance institution, which also has a capital participation in Hungary, amounting to EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend, at the highest level, the Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government agreed to participate in the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Economic Competition.
The Bank Fortis is the first in the euro area that has been in a major crisis in the international financial markets, which has been spreading in the waves for over a year, and the decision made in this matter could, in some respects, be considered as precedents.
In the sense of the decision that was made on Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (49 per cent) of the bank's dark property.
The bank is absolutely sure to sell part of its equity participation, especially then - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
The bank shares of Fortis began to fall early last week, and in the second half of the week, serious signs of the crisis had appeared in the constitution.
However, analysts agree that with their 85 thousand employees, the bank is too large to let it get hurt.
The company's price papers fell only 12 per cent on Friday, at a minimum of 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but it is not realistic, according to the business leaders.
The company's management is still responsible for the decline in Fortis' shares in the maritime market in connection with the adoption of the US package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday, the shares got a little steeper.
On Friday, the new Director-General, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to the head of the bank.
The monetary institution was also looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has yet submitted.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors do not have to worry about their money coming.
The bank's clients haven't panicked yet, and the sidewalks haven't been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate side and also has several leasing companies.
Hemp in the stomach
Life and health insurance in America, based on people's data on the purchase of medicines, often rejects the possibility of entering into a contract with the insurer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that weighs on the use of data on prescriptions in any case on the authorisation of the person concerned.
He must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we trust the fox's stomach," quoted Washington Post Richard Dick, author of the drug prescription program.
Insurance undertakings shall make insurance and the amounts paid in the case of insurance events dependent on the health of the persons concerned and, where the risk is assessed as too large, insurance shall not be closed with it.
They had previously sent the relevant medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on an identification number, the customer from the doctor will easily find out what medication he has bought for the last year and half, from which the program itself brings out what he suffers from the disease and what his condition is.
For example, if she regularly buys a large amount of cholesterol-lowering medicines, it indicates that she has practically uncontrollable high blood fat levels, which will immediately be classified as a higher risk category.
There are currently several versions of the programme, some of which also identify the risk factor, so there is almost no work left, except for the paperwork, although there are minor problems.
In the case of disadvantages, lighter drugs can also be used for several purposes, for example, some combinations are applicable against migraine or fever, but are also effective against depression.
They represent a significant increase in the risk of commercial insurance, which is not the first known difficulty.
In order to request and process data, special companies have been established which require a patient's authorisation prior to receiving the necessary information from the physician.
To that end, the authorities are already forced to do so, although they have not been persecuted for their present negligence.
Some companies have been processing the results of laboratory examinations that link with the data on the medications used, thus providing a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
The data is increasingly accessible to companies, while monitoring their use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health services and insurance providers.
The proposal for a law which gives the authorities the power to control and the companies specialising in the provision of data is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: therefore, he developed his program in such a way that the data transmission is linked to the express consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the permit in question can only be difficult to resist, otherwise insurance will not conclude the contract with him.
So the blind are just a little bit off on the leaf of good will.
Global Marseilles Menu
The European Union and India double the turnover
Since the European Union and India are each other’s leading trading partners, this topic is also led by other, mostly global problems, also by the number of nine summits at the highest level.
Today, there will also be a French-Indian summit, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is developing democratic power, which should be given a greater opportunity to speak on international issues, while Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator in support of the continued membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not further settled at the 9th summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as current President of the Union, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed to double the turnover by five years, or increase by more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious target.
In this sense, twenty-six existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been legally agreed, so it has been brought to the fore in future and air transport.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is among EU partners to the ninth place.
The Summit also focused on the global issue.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, has been condemned by both sides in all its forms and called for an accelerated UN conference.
They also ordered the closure of the Dauh trade negotiations, although they both have a large share of his current disaster.
The European Union has confirmed that it will continue to operate on its energy and climate programme, because it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed, as well as that the climate conference for next year would need to conclude a global agreement and reduce the greenhouse effect by 50 per cent by 2050.
Both parties would also like to prevent increased food prices and support the call for an international conference to explore the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister joins the French capital, where he intends to close the trade for the peaceful use of nuclear energy at the bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that the commitment to build Indian nuclear reactors worth €20 billion is granted by French companies.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement should have a validity of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Great participation of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers are participating in the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take 171,790 meters of square fairs with more than four hundred three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honest guest.
The Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony in the Italian pavilion: Italy is actually participating institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 metres of the four-quarter exhibition grounds.
It will follow the press meeting in the Room Structure Buchmesse in pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to introduce numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books of foreign authors in terms of total Italian production is still diminishing, mainly due to literature for children and adults.
Found a plane of Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared on 3rd February 2007, was found while flying through the desert in Nevada.
Troskys were discovered at one upper level at an altitude of three thousand metres, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human remains inside the airport.
Sheriff Madeira County, John Anderson, raised the doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we are sure that it's exactly what Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared," said at a press conference.
The sheriff made it clear that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old is considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Security Office (Ntsb) announced that a few hours after the hit was detected, an investigation team was sent that finally identified the aircraft: it was exactly about Bellanca 8kcab, not reported since 3 February 2007, when Fosset fled from Yerington to Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some Fosset's personal items were found by one couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
This is about two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by Illinois Federal Air Force, money in cash and one bundle.
The search for Fossetta was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has gained a place in history thanks to the long collection of championships.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in an air balloon: two weeks of flight by himself.
Three years later, the world flew on a plane and no landing.
Among its many records are also the height of 15,445 meters, above Anda, even with the bastard.
Glk, a commercial you don't expect
One unusual suv with original design and precisely defined by the decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last-born Glk of the "compact" jeeps home of the star, by which Mercedes-Benz tried to introduce faith news into this sector.
Just thanks to its non-traditional processing, it will be unexpected and unconventional and communication that will accompany the launch of Suv Glk on the market and which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17th of October.
This way the advertising campaign, which follows the start of the new vehicle, also launches an informal way of communication thanks to a futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which was first used in Italy for the car brand.
The Maxi posters project, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan trade class, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin by introducing a car in stereoscopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see a new Suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Actually, if you look at the picture, you'll get the feeling that the car's getting out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be lit at different times in all its smalls, so that it can then be reassembled in a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce this ad into the stereotypical field of car communication.
Will he be able to awaken the interest of future customers in this way?
So we know who the Italian chulgans are.
Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of Italy? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following Nazionale Azzurra for years, and who have, as it is said, never made any overcrowded problems.
She's never even met an opponent's fan.
The group's orientation is right.
The founders come from Trivenet.
With Verona, Padovy, Terstu and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact few groups) were added to them from Campania and from Puglie.
They have three-coloured flags showing the cities of origin of the participants: on Saturday night they were removed so that they were not recognized.
They inspire English fans.
They found real Nazi fans in Bulgaria, Levsky.
Figc gave the Italian fans 144 entries for the match: all by name, so easily controllable.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Daslem, no one to visit the stadium.
Four blue fans who had earlier stadium breakouts were denied entry and a forbidden match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the messages coming from the Bulgarian police, then take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo to at least five years old fans who were arrested or those who were identified during the emergency.
The International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our chulgarans, they're not even going to a stadium anymore.
Good luck.
But now there is fear of emulsion: this means that more than one hundred fifty are added to them.
"We have to stop this fire immediately and not justify those who act this way," Viminal confirmed.
So, "well-opened eyes, mainly because of a national strike in the middle of Leči."
In Puglia, there's a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow, Osservatorio, on Tuesday, Casms, who can also count with one part of Aise, is a secret service that deals with the problems at the stadiums.
"Collect Leader-Leader and armed guard during Mamelia's Hymna? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a very little happy way), which is a few weeks old director of the Viminal Observatory (getting a place that had previously been Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferrizi).
Mazzilli was a former Quaestor in Terst, where there is the nucleus of Ultras Italia's supporters, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the leader, but of course, that the conduct of these 150-200 fans is a shame.
"I am not a sociologist - adding the Observer Unit - the crimes are committed to the country in which they became.
So far, this group has remained within the limits, now we're going to look very carefully at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about reincarnation at Mamelia's: it's not even a crime, but if you allow it, it's a ignorance...
