Petr Čech: Switching to the last minute?
It's all possible.
Today is the last day when you can still skip the transfer window and make a big break.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Petr Čech, currently replacement contractor Chelsea, but now does not sit on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the NH Hotel, talks with Czech journalists and is going to be with the Czech representative at the game general with the Americans and then at the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In the bronze Chelsea, the new season, the Prime Minister League is favored by Thibaut Courtois, Czech has first received a replacement position in the London club in ten years.
In time, it was speculated that the Czech might be interested in Real Madrid.
In the beginning of the season, the Spanish Superpohar lost in the struggles with the Athletics and failed to enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
It also speculated about the interest of Paris SG.
In the French league season, he retired two wins and two retributes, shot St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
Relatively the most pressing button of the club AS Monaco.
He's got a 1-1-2 balance sheet in his league, and he broke up with Lille at 1:1 a.m. on the weekend.
On the English bullfight websites today, reports have come out that Czechs might want to be in Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, though, Czech leaving Chelsea for the last time is not too likely.
The skylight on him wrote a 4:1 course.
Peter, is it possible for you to change your dress during the remaining few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never anything in the football.
Maybe during the day, an offer that won't be rejected.
How would such an offer look?
(Laughter) "Well, I still don't know how an offer that can't be rejected actually looks.
It would have to come to the concurrence of all the parties above all, whether or not Chelsea would have dealt with the offer of the club.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transition when you're in Prague now?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere else?
I didn't think about it that way.
But in such a situation, there are many players today, all of them are somewhere on the scene, and certainly there are still many crossings to be closed today.
So somehow feasible would certainly be.
How many clubs on the planet could they afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not going to go?
The situation where I didn't catch a new season in the first three games is for me after fifteen years of careers.
But there's no reason to panic, pack up and go somewhere.
I want to continue to participate in this fight on Chelsea's position, and it's on the coach who chooses what decision he will make over the next few weeks.
What role does family play in your decision?
I take all the factors into account.
It's important to me, of course, a sports perspective, but I'm looking at it from the personal page that family needs, of course.
Is it possible you'd catch another club in England?
That's the question I thought would never concern me.
But it's all possible in football.
I don't want to rule out anything.
I don't know the answer.
Presidents of India and Japan for a meeting in Tokyo
The new Indian president of the Narendra Modi government is in Tokyo to meet with his Japanese opponent Shinzo Abem. On his first major visit to the May victory elections, he has to discuss economic and security commitments.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to secure economic ties there with the third world's largest economy.
The list is the first of the plans for enhanced cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
According to the Indian rapporteurs, both nations also hope to agree on cooperation on defence issues.
Police in Karata arrested a 20-year-old boy after a motorcycle chase
They stopped the engine after they had reached the maximum permitted speed of 70 km/h and drove 125 km/h to the woods to get away from the police.
The monitoring transport police in Karata tried to stop the blue engine at the border in the morning, when they noticed that it was 125 km/h when they left at the Bathgate Road station.
According to the police, the driver didn't stop and continue after Burgess Road and then he went to the bus, so the police lost him out of control.
The engine and the person who corresponded to the driver's description were then watched at the home of Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The Karath police have accused a 20-year-old of disobeying the challenge of stopping and taking care of him.
Before the court in Karata, it will be September 23rd.
The motorcycle was fun for three months.
George Webster accused of rape at hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man will be set up before the court for charges of rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was accused of hearing the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
Apparently on 7 June 2013 in Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire, he had to rape a woman.
According to the claim, Webster attacked her, while “she was unconscious, asleep, and unable to give her consent.”
In addition, Webster has been obtained to rape other women at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn at the Scottish High Court on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date for the retrial at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh on 17 November.
Renewal of the very American ideal that labour rights are at the same time human rights
Congressman Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law to protect civil law in the committees.
"As the committees function, jobs are working for the middle class," says Ellison, a Democratic Senator for Minnesota, who is co-chaired by the Congress Committee.
That's why I'm so proud that, together with the model of ordinary rights, I can introduce a law strengthening the position of employees.
This mid-term legislation gives workers the same legal option as to combating discrimination in the organisation of committees, as in other forms of discrimination - and will put an end to counter-committee forces.
To amend the Labour Relations Act in such a way as to enable all employees facing discrimination, if they wish to join the committees, to judge before the Civil Court - and to judge compensation or compensation for damage - is a proper and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other drafters are proposing in the law is to re-attach to American ideals.
Even in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries - the Americans have ever supported countries around the world to accept, extend and respect labour laws.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them when the country committed democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to collect.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt the constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their committees played a role in forming new Japan, including language and openly acknowledged that "the right of employees to gather, to negotiate collectively and to act is guaranteed."
When after World War II, the United States occupied Germany, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisors urged Germany to create a constitution that would ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by strong democracy.
The Germans realized that workers would need to organize and promote a new nation and therefore included clauses that openly say: “The right to create a society that ensures and improves working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and to every call or profession.
Agreements which will restrict this right or attempt to harm it shall be abolished. Measures leading to the fulfilment of that purpose shall be illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, President of the International Commission for Human Rights, proposed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, the drafters and Roosevelt guaranteed that "every person has the right to establish and enter into committees within the framework of the protection of his interests."
The American generations have accepted the basic assumption that labour rights are human rights.
When the country worked with other countries on how to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create working committees - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies in the position of an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are attacked in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that workers must have the right to organize and promote in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Everyone knows today that the forces of the people have not diminished, but they have expanded it.
They raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and produced them at an unprecedented level.
Those who attack the committees forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and we shouldn't.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination in the organisation of committees - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that led America and made it a real bond of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked the law that could close all the foster clinics in Louisiana
The federal judge temporarily blocked a Louisiana law on Sunday, which, according to lawyers, would likely close all five clinics of execution in the state.
The order signed by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindala in June, which is in force on 1 September, would require doctors to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital up to 30 miles away from their practice.
The judgment of the judge means that doctors can proceed temporarily in the conduct of legal proceedings and, in the meantime, have to exercise this authorisation.
"The proposed party will be able to act legally and, in the meantime, obtain permission," says Federal Judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more lasting resolution on the law.
Activists welcomed the decision-making process, which is the last in a series of similar measures, and said that they would give doctors more time to get permission.
"Today's decision ensures that women in Louisiana will be safe from the government law to prepare them for their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, who, on behalf of three of the five clinics, sought to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerned doctors from two clinics that were not between the complainants, and they also requested that this authorisation be granted.
Louisiana is one of the eleven states that have passed similar laws, and the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such measures contrary to the provisions.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most remaining clinics in the state, blocked the federal judge on Friday.
Women's Rights Fighters, together with the Association of American Infants and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, claim that the need to have this authorisation applies to a physician to requirements that are not necessary from a medical point of view.
Protesters of kidnappings objected that measures aimed at protecting women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that the clinics would be closed because of the measures.
The Centre for Reproduction has indicated that Louisiana has only one doctor who is suffering from a loss.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop the execution of the abortions, this doctor would also, in fear of his safety, stop the move, the group said.
The Louisian authorities in the reaction stated that doctors who are suffering losses would not be punished while waiting for a claim to grant rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor access to treatment, ovaries are more common in rural cancers
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video containing their dream mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at greater risk of dying of ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with ovary cancer and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
The QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, led by Susan Jordan, stated that women in rural and remote areas of the state had about 20 per cent higher probability of dying than women in urban areas during the study.
TEACHER: New medicines can reduce lung cancer and ovaries
Researchers have been following women for seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the chances of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovaries carcinoma, other existing disease and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate was observed in elderly women with cancer being diagnosed at an advanced stage.
In rural and remote areas, women were about 20 percent more likely to die than women in urban areas during the study.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that factors can be late diagnosis and poor access to treatment.
"The power to treat gynecooncologists who usually live in larger cities can best be treated," she said.
Despite improving medical services at a distance to overcome a barrier in the form of a distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen the transport service that allows specialists to treat women close to their homes and programs to support people who are being treated far away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low in terms of geographical location, stressing the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.

In March 2012, the young mother of Elisha Neave from the city of Gold Coast was diagnosed with aggressive form of egg cancer.
Gardening centers regret a reduction in the number of owners of homes
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary housing of owners of homes under 35 years of age could lead to the achievement of the "main age groups of gardeners" of up to ten million pounds a year.
According to the report, people who rent their homes lose their gardens on average 55 % of the amount that they lose in their homes.
As other dangerous factors in the sector, which makes up the estimated five billion pounds a year, indicate an increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas where there are no gardens, the form of a loan instead of a pre-war area used as a parking area and reducing the size of the garden.
In the area of Great London, where the share of owned houses fell from 61% to 43% during the six years, one household is the lowest expenditure on garden products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society have stated that housing in a basement or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the main garden consultant for RHS, said: “The tenants have a very popular flowering plant - when they move, plants can be taken with them.”
The HTA report found that the "gold age" of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of home owners and economic prosperity ranging from 80 to mid-90.
He also foretold a higher break this year because of the better weather that came under adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator says about democracy.
After Putin met his youth organization, which reminds me most of all, he saved with nuclear weapons and basically revealed to everyone that their views were stolen from him, gave us today a lecture on democracy.
But I feel that the current regime in Russia shows a lot of drawings of a fascist state.
The great nations have one common one, and it is that they can control them both drunk nationalism, and that the minority complex can transform them into imperialist shoes.
The time spent in the east is probably different than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the period of war over Europe was long gone, on the other hand, they thought that they had been viewed for a long time and that it was necessary to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration ruled in Germany in the thirty years, just before the Nazi power was taken over and then followed by the explosion of nationalism that is similar to the situation in Russia today.
And then the totally consistent cult of a strong leader, the slander of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, is very similar.
Vladimir Putin and most of the Russians are probably at a time when Russia ruled half of the world and the second part was shaking in front of them.
The Western politicians may have blamed themselves, perhaps a few of Vladimir’s cries for his shoulder, perhaps not inviting him to his place of interest, and perhaps starting to underestimate him, and he was just acting like a typical Russian man.
He did his homework, he pretended that he didn't really want to go anywhere and brushed the knife at home.
Now he's decided he'll get the lost position back.
It's starting slowly, it's time.
The leader's probably alive, so where would he go?
The Kavkasany smeared, now the Ukrainian smeared, and then they're in a row of pobalt smears.
The Russian bear has been in the skin for a long time.
He's gonna notice that, too, China, who's kind of jumping out, and he's definitely going to take a look at the other way out.
And those Germans of the Vladimir also look pretty good, and that's what I put in their ass 45.
This is how to make a new Novosio in Karl's Varech.
That would be the base and ours are a lot of them and how they're being pressed and the fingers are already trying to get the lacquer out of them.
For our veterans have long remembered how they were doing in Czechoslovakia.
Now the vote is their Prime Minister, Mr. Sobotka, he is so soft, he can walk like a brick and I'll dream of their entire EU.
It'd be so fun to jump to big Russia.
They need to remember where their place is.
And we're going to use our roommates, who live in their territory.
The Russians are pretty everywhere, and when they say they're being drowned in it, they're just being drowned in it, and we're not gonna let that happen, we're gonna protect them.
And the Russians will rule for what they are born.
Europe is only good as a proposal on which proud Ivan can dance goats.
Turkey called for an American diplomat for the Spanish report
The Turkish Foreign Minister called the country's highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to explain the report on American and British espionage activities in Turkey.
The president of the government of Bulent said that the US cargo d'affaires and the Turkish state officials had acted on the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept stated that according to the documents provided by the former US National Security Agency analysis, Turkey was the priority target of US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been baccalating the importance of the report and has declared that all major states are following each other.
The older report, which also pointed to the German intelligence service, called on the Turkish government to extend its response.

Police Director in Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the complainants submitted to the Mallorian State Prosecutor's Office evidence of expulsion from police officers and state council officials in the Calvia area of self-government.
The chief of police in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after the charges brought by the businessman and owner of the bar in the unrecognised district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was involved in the investigation after he was charged with corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street in which most bars and night-time businesses are located in Magaluf.
According to the Internet newspaper Mallorca Diario, the complainant's prosecutor of the Mallorian Agency for the Suppression of Corruption submitted evidence of expulsion from police officers and state council officials in the Calvia self-government area on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish state police for associating with corruption charges and were heard by a judge with Navarre.
The Spanish ABC’s national journal quoted the unhappy owners of night-time businesses, according to which the public authorities have a serious impact on their business.
“It’s not a long time ago about making money, it’s about survival,” said one of the entrepreneurs in court.
Don't play with our life.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf arrived on the world's main news page after a video of eight-year-old British tourists appeared on YouTube, who provided oral sex to 24 men during the bar tour.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to keep an eye on the drinkers and barbers in a number of participants in the Magaful holiday parties by reducing the number of well-known alcoholic tours by bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where there has been an event with oral sex, was forced to close the year and, together with tour organizers at Carnage's bar, to pay a fine of EUR 55,000 ($73 000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is particularly popular in Britain, was also a witness of many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including fashion waves known as "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day marked by rain and storms that affected the airport at Adelaide
JARO brought the south of South Australia a surprise of ice, came with strong rain and rough winds, which seriously hit Adelaide airport.
The next 5 mm of impact falls in the city until nine hours of night and another 6,6 mm falls during the night of the week.
The last rain came along with a few short bumps connected to the storm and wind currents that began eight hours ago and during about ten minutes brought nearly 4 mm of precipitation.
After a few timely doses of barley came in winter last week, the temperature in the city dropped again on Monday at only 15.8 °C.
It is estimated that storm weather has contributed to the late Virgin Airlines trip from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The airport was to land at 19:30, but it was soon to change the speed or direction of the wind and was forced to land.
Wind currents at Adelaide airport reached the country at about 50 km/h.
The flight data showed that the plane had to leave from second landing and finally arrived at about 20:40.
The delay of the aircraft subsequently resulted in the delay of the following years, including the flight of Emirates from Dubai and the flight of Qantas from Sydney.
The temperature in Adelaide shall be reached at a maximum of 16 °C in Tuesday and one or two can be observed.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the area near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in anti-bomb shelters, while rockets and minimets were attacked in their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. However, schools in Gaza remain closed, while the country remembers the war.
The beginning of the school brought to the community in southern Israel the marked attacks of joy and excitement, but the signs of the battle are still visible.
In Ashdoda, a city in the south of the country, the school staff who hit the rocket removed the remains from the walls of the strips and were expected to return the children.
"We are a little scared, but otherwise we are looking forward," said Ronit Bartová, a native of the Saad kibucu and an English teacher at the local school.
A lot of children in this area really need to get back to their routine every day.
Her eleven-year-old daughter Shani Bart learned that "it's a bit strange" to go back to school.
"We lived a few difficult moments and we didn't even leave the house," she said.
Kibuc, located near the border with Gaza, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer support to the people.
Until the ceasefire last week of the war ended, thousands of inhabitants of border settlements such as Saad have stayed inside their homes or their homes and left to safer areas away from Gaza to avoid rockets and minimets.
Many inhabitants of Nawal Oz, a village close to the border with Gaza, where she shot a four-year-old boy from the Palestinian Minimet, returned with weight.
The Minister of Education has stated that about twelve families have not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in replacement schools.
The president of the Benjamin Netanyahu government visited the school in Sderota, a city on the border with Gaza, which was severely affected by Palestinian fire.
He urged his children to study and he said, “We will provide you with education and security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a timeless peace last Tuesday.
The ceasefire, however, did not solve the key problems as Hamas' call for the end of the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and the reconstruction of the airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel requires the armed forces of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers who fell into battle.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to the estimates of Palestinians and the United Nations, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, of which three quarters made civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel doubts and estimates that at least half of the killed were radical, although there is no clear evidence for this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza have fired 4 591 rockets in battles in the Israeli cities, especially in the south, and fired from the mines.
The Israeli army has again made more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and the estimated 250,000 people hid in hundreds of United Nations schools, which were converted into a temporary shelter.
Because of the tens of thousands of people who are still hiding, and because of the ongoing struggles, they postponed school officials last week at the start of the school year.
"I hope that the school will soon be opened so that we can complete our education as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a thirteen-year-old boy from the school in the largest city of Gaza.
I'm standing behind Vácho.
Lafatu is suffering from fever
The Czech football team met in Prague this afternoon before the mid-preparation match with the United States and the next opening match of the European Championships against the Netherlands.
From a three-and-a-half-year camp, there are problems with a sputum attacker, David Lafat, who is suffering from fever.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was about more players, and David's got a little bit more problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"If it will be two or three days, or if it will be fit tomorrow, it will be seen according to his health status, which our doctor will decide about," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has some pain, but it's not that they can't train or participate in a fight Wednesday with the United States," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday night, Vrba called as the last player of the Spartan hostage Lukas Vách.
He admitted that it was not easy to make decisions, and he also considered other medievals.
I've decided on the basis that Lucas is a prospective player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I am behind it," Vrba told Vácho.
What about Shural?
Let's see what's going to happen to Latata.
It is not excluded that in the case of health problems, the appointment could still change.
About the weekend with a great performance, for example, the liberal Josef Šural, who gave the hattrick.
Of course, there are players who have been showing shape lately.
We'll see how David Lafata's gonna be on it.
In case it cannot be available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I can nominate any of the players who have been involved in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon, a representative of the trainees are waiting for us at Fearov, then on Tuesday, a classic pre-supply train from the US to Summer, which will be open for fans and then follow the autograph.
Fighting with the Americans is on Wednesday from 20:15, and the national team in it will strive for the victory of the Prime Minister under Vrba.
In the previous three preparatory matches, he won two retributes and lost once.
The qualifying match with the Netherlands is then on 9 September from 20:45.
The foot goes to the Netherlands to Italy
The Vorba is happy that it has more time to train than previous meetings.
It is an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice with them certain things that we need not have much time before.
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing for the best in the Netherlands," praised Vrba.
The Dutch will present themselves before the match in Prague on Thursday in Italy and the duel will personally monitor the former temporary representative of Josef Pešice.
Gives us the information they're from the match.
But it's not just about him, we're gonna have a game and we're gonna have a game and we're gonna split it up.
A new coach comes to the Netherlands, we'll see what changes will be made there," Vrba told bronze medalists from a recent world championship.
According to the very following statistics, the prices of the apartments in the winter period have grown most in the last seven years.
According to the Australian capital RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic's housing price index increased by 1.1 % in August, the agency indicated on Monday.
The increase resulted in a total increase in red, red, and red, and up to 4.2%, the highest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase increased by 10.9%, more than twice a year by August 2013, but the country did not have an evenly distributed profit.
RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless said they run Sydney and Melbourne on the market.
RP Data shows that the prices of Sydney's apartments increased by 16,1 % last year, while prices in Melbourne by 11,7 %.
Among the other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with an increase in prices averaged between five and six percent.
On the other hand, Canberra, which was damaged by the state's cost reduction and where prices increased only by 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that when the spring began, the number of properties for sale in the following months will increase, which will be for the "real test" market.
‘In view of the continuing high level of auction sales, generally high sales speed and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of housing will increase even further over the next three months,’ he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With their father who died when Henry was 19, who worked in the factory, they had a colder relationship.
Henry's testing comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melodies is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with a few unpleasant childhood memories.
After her mother died, Henry went through "deep" therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have heard his voice: “Stop with this frame.
Leave the sister alone.
Get out of here!
I want to look at the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were already adults - went to the bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a glass of beer or the beauty of a hit in the cricket.
I've never talked to him like this.
Most of my life was a serious guy in a corner reading the newspaper.
Henry recently visited Dudley's basement, and although the conditions were better than in his father's time, he looked at what life had to be for him.
There's more light in there today, but it's still a dark, smoked, cloudy labyrinth, where the flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and seasoning.
Dad always went into the bathroom and was just lying there, and then he heard how slowly he started to sing for himself because he was laughing at the plumbing.
When I went around, I realized that he had done this year to enjoy his family, and I began to respect him more.
Even so, Henry lived a childhood without parental love.
Dad never hugged anyone, said "I love you."
When Mom was sick and she died, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, who's with Dawn French, made it possible for him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop "I love you"?
Don't keep hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
With French who was married for 25 years, they're still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't we be friends with Dawn?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had a sugar.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of weight and the symptoms of diabetes began to appear, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to the big fitness center and I also had to keep a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And unique.
No one wants to eat the carrots themselves.
Change in the direction of Henry's career is perhaps reflected in his elegant, short-haired beard.
After he got his credit for the criticism of his Othell, he went to the theater.
The comedy followed with his mistakes and the Fleets of August Wilson.
It's a different experience than sitcomy and comedy that filled his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him on the podium as he paraded someone, and he wrote about him at the New Faces talent competition.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: “For a long time, I was the only black copyist/comika on TV.”
He learned to walk.
In addition to having to be noticed by the public, I also had to learn from the years 1975 and 1985 how to invent functional jokes, to be a star and to be on TV, and it was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
In view of the fact that his manager owned the right to make the show The Black and White Minstrel Show, the entertainment program in which the actors were dressed in blacks, Henry finally appeared in it with his comedy for five years.
My family was no longer there because of it.
I wish it never happened, but I don't.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the lady.
What was "years and years appreciated the main product of British television", but was also "grotic black parody."
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and presented figures that at the same time ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began broadcasting in 1984 and in the 1990s was also known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comic series Chef!.
For decades, he received advertisements, documents, television shows and roles in films, but after sending his Lenny Henry.tv to BBC in 2008, he said, "What you're going to do now, Lene, it seems a little bit like you're stuck in one place, or you get a little off the road."
Next in line was a documentary series on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespeare.
We didn't study him properly at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
All those with whom we had an interview, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get used to it if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all like Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented 20 lines from Othello's final speech for the document and was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it's giving me the courage.
“It’s about it. It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn text, find out something about it.
So the test was hard, and I've been reading the game for months and months before.
And it was a success.
Looks like they're waiting for a leak, which didn't happen.
Soon he started playing full-time in Comedy.
I was in the National Theatre all of a sudden, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical accident, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for the public's entertainment.
“The voice in my head said, ‘Before the computer is fixed, you have to play them for ten minutes now.’”
Instead, the theater director announced that the performance will continue as soon as the problem is resolved.
I left the show, and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can handle it for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plotch in Duchess Theatre
Learning the Plot text was a challenge.
Panika's pretty good, she's giving a decision.
The game was also well accepted, so it's like God's sign saying, "This is what you should do."
Of course, it's called by the expert's voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really like it.
I'm happy to try.
Henry, however, remains the co-medicant's brain - throughout our conversation interrupts with humor when he comes in and out of the role of the simulator.
I decided not to make stand-ups because having satisfaction from the room full of foreigners is a bit dangerous, I would say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get to the blind alley.
Sometimes, when I want to, I do live at the Apollo, but I don't like it as before.
I was wondering if he'd ever set up a stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in one room with the director, who helps to set the boundaries of the beginning, the means and the end of the journey - I don't think I would ever give up on it.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm having a good time.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers state officials to focus on non-existent employees
Kenya started with the biometric registration of all her state officials to try to get rid of the government's non-existent employee payroll.
According to the Government, employees who are not registered in the next two weeks will cease to receive payment.
The government believes that thousands of people are paid even after they leave the public service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to ban corruption in the government.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state comes monthly at least one million dollars (700,000 pounds) on the payments of non-existent employees and in the event of another abuse of official power.
The government suspects that payments are still included in the bank accounts and after the death of the employee or after the employee leaves the state administration, the BBC reporter from the capital of Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri, introduced.
All state officials must be provided within the next two weeks to the identification centres where their data are biometrically recorded, shall be reported in the government statement.
He also says that anyone who does not leave without an apology will be removed from the payroll.
"Insulting actual public service employees will make a significant contribution to its procurement and will also be used to clear the payroll on both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waigur, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Tens of Turkish police officers arrested for "fighting" against the government
Local media reports that 33 police officers were detained in Turkey due to suspicion of "fighting against the government".
The police have been commenting on the case.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, there were fourteen high-ranking officials detained.
Some of them were involved in the December investigation of corruption, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and listening to the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at that time the president of the government) marked their actions as part of the role of Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gulen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to Ukraine to school
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and the president of the government of Arsenij Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he informed the journalists present that not all schools had reopened, but that it was decided to defend the country for the next generation:
Not at all schools, a traditional ceremony took place on the 1st of January.
Not all of Ukraine is peace.
We have to fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, a united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukov, a teacher at the school in Slavyanska, visited Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain the knowledge that will benefit them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated so that children wear fancy shirts, bring balloons and flowers to the teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, maybe BBC found the boss for hard times
Take with you a cloud of fame from the banking world, media management and internal conclave of the conservative party.
I've got my own experience on the front lines.
The career began in the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the Pearsons media world.
She was the executive director of the Financial Times for seven years. She was registered when her younger colleague, Pearson, was the senior member of the parent company.
It's said that her distance was close to a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former director of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed a private expertise: she became a consultant to the government.
Her husband is an ex-member of the City Council.
In May, I described the director's work as a chalice with poison.
Not only is the BBC an extensive and complex entity in the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns to two directions: inside to the top level of the hierarchy of its own management of BBC, but also out to the public in times of unrest when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that requires a thorough reform.
Which director would, however, risk coming to a company complex as a Chinese dynasty, disbanding it and preparing himself for work.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see how the BBC decreases - its power, its finances - and how its status is revised.
With the expansion of the competition circle and the new technology questioning the old security, the immediate deal on concession fees for BBC is a major threat.
For a modest amount of 145,50 pounds a year, the British public buys a share in something that is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC reports a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of the household and each one, however, is only 40 per cent a day.
In addition, the BBC format clearly stands: 53% of beneficiaries compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The BBC service models have changed: Today, I have news headlines showing up on my mobile phone and on the lines I've been browsing, I can look at iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very loving and wonderful institution.
She needs a great director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry claims that the offensive tweet didn't approve.
Tweet from the official twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, published on Sunday, contained an offensive image of a democratic state representative who initiated Perry's criminal charge of abuse of power.
Tweet was later reduced and on Perry's account was published another one that had distanced himself from the previous.
My account left a tweet that was not authorized.
"I disagree with the tweet and I got it," he added in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is in fact responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published an unlicensed, humorous picture of the State Representative Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of abortion in April 2013.
If she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay for her office, which Perry, a potential candidate for the presidential election in 2016, brought this month before the great jury in Austin.
On the list in the tweet, it said: “I don’t always drive three times as high blood alcohol as I’m allowed... but if so, I’m sorry, Governor Perry, that he calls me to be responsible for this.”
I'm the most unlicensed democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perrym was not carried out by the Lehmberg Authority.
He was taken care of by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonia, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent, and the charge was called a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team requested a judge who was watching the case to reject the charge, because the use of the laws for the purpose of reaching a court order for the duration of the service of the governor in the history of Texas is contradictory.
Perry stopped paying $7.5 million from the State Fund for Public Interest Deprived, which has a seat in Travis County and is committing corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The refusal resulted in a formal complaint from a left-handed group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes even celebrates.
After he ended up in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012 in the fifth place on his party committee, Perry responded to speculation that he could already end with a tweet of his own picture running near the lake, and he said, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market returns "to normal"
One of the most prominent London developing companies warned that the housing market in southeastern England had "returned" to normal activity.
Housing in the capital was the subject of high demand and rising prices and increased concerns from credit bubbles led to the introduction of mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and president of the Berkeley Business Company, said on Monday: "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market from the top point of 2013 has returned to the normal level of the transaction." He adds that it provides "a stable environment for functioning."
London’s housing market was good during the decline, as customers from abroad sailed to the capital.
According to the date of the disaster, only last year prices in the city increased by 18.5%, which exceeded the average of 6.7% in England and the whole of Wales.
Average sales prices of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about five last year, and at the end of April, they spread to 423,000 pounds.
However, in recent months, for foreign buyers of London's property, it has not been so attractive - some of them have also threatened to introduce new property taxes and talk about possible "sea-days", with which politicians came in front of the parliamentary elections next May.
London's real estate office Foxtons warned last week that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter loan rules, would also slow down the pace of market growth during the second half of the year in the sale of properties and prices.
The new Bank of England data showed a decrease in the number of approved mortgages in June, indicating that the housing market is being calmed.
Hamptons International, another real estate office, has reduced on the basis of the fact that home prices have already begun to decline, their forecast growth in London's property prices for 2015 by 3%.
The volume of transactions according to the real office of WA Ellis, between London's most expensive districts such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, decreased by a quarter each year.
Nevertheless, the demand for residence in the capital for the Berkeley blessing was increased by more than 2.2 billion pounds in cash for the forward sale.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well-appearing housing in the right location remained the same and, thanks to this, the forward sale was maintained.”
In June, the company announced that it sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the crisis in 2007.
The annual profit before tax increased by 40% to 380 million pounds, by 18% to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday before Pidgley's annual meeting, it was predicted that Berkeley's annual returns would be in line with the current market expectation.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before the tax is paid will be 450 million pounds.
Berkeley's stock stopped at the London Stock Exchange this afternoon on 23.96 pounds.
Internet hacker posted photos of Jennifer Lawrence's naked
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th year of the Cen Academy.
Photos of the holders Oscar Jennifer Lawrence escaped on the Internet because of the hacker who claimed to have a "list" photo of other hundreds of starting toys.
"Hunger Games" spokesperson confirmed that Lawrence's photos are true and hacker criticised for "clearly private breach."
The offices have already been contacted and will reach everyone who stole photos of Jennifer Lawrence's public.
The hacker photos that were originally published on the 4chan image sharing server were reportedly obtained thanks to the interface in the Apple iCloud internet storage system. The reported list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanny, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, however, the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" was also criticised on Twitter.
"I hope that those of you who are looking at the photos we had with your husband in the private home years ago are satisfied," Winstedwa wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, however, is known from the Nickolodeon cable TV series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied that the photos would be true. On Twitter she said, "These are my imaginary naked photos, people."
It's better to get it out of the way.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday night that the speakers of the Ariany Grande pop stars denied that the alleged photographs would be true.
Extraordinary exhibition from Howard Jacobson's excited new novel about the love and the letter "J"
Dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, gradually spread as a cardboard box that someone left on the rain.
Only from time to time did a woman tell him that she was too serious, complicated, rigid, isolated and perhaps a little shy.
And then she shakes his hand.
He just let himself in.
He was able to pee like a bear, yeah.
The last victim of this ability was the beginning of a loving flock that promised him more than usual that he would be taken away from the loneliness of life and perhaps give him some satisfaction.
Ailin Solomons was a fragile beauty with wild hot hair and a fleeting heart from the village on the north island, which was even more distant and more hospitable than Port Reuben.
The older company that Kevern thought was her aunt who had inherited the property in a wet, but a beautiful valley called the Paradise Valley, possibly.
No one's been in the house for years.
The pipes said, there were dead spiders in the tubs, the skiers signed out on the windows, as if they thought it belonged to them, the garden was thick, and the plume reminded the giant hairheads.
The house looked like a chaloupe from childhood stories, scary and at the same time fascinating, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations at the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The final selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailin sat on the loose chairs in the long grass and held their hands, took advantage of the unexpected hot spring afternoon, immediately loaded up the public station, which the country had stored a pleasant music and comforting news, when in that regard he remembered the old song of a long forgotten black comic that his father loved to listen to by the hidden rollers.
You've got too big legs.
Because of their natural aggression, such songs were no longer played on the radio.
They weren't forbidden - it wasn't really forbidden - they just didn't play.
They helped them get to the deuce, just like the word deuce.
People's tastes have proved what they would never have been able to do without the law, and like people in the book, they choose the memoirs in which the poor become rich, the cooks and the lovers of the novels, so they choose the ballads in music.
Kavern let himself be cut off on the day and began to play on the imaginary piano and the rough, comical voice singing the series with Alilin's big feet.
I don't think so.
"It was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said and added two fingers automatically to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to push his letter out of his mouth.
It started out like a game when he was a kid.
His father told him that the game was playing with his father.
When you were at the word that started on it, you didn't get two fingers in front of your mouth, you got five.
It wasn't so funny and it wasn't funny anymore.
He just knew it was expected of him, it was all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailin never heard of anyone.
Not even jazz, even though it wasn't built out of law, they didn't play.
The improvisation came out of fashion.
There was only one place in life for one "if".
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where it was going to end.
The same in humor.
His inescapability went on the nerves.
And jazz was a humour expressed in song.
Although he hadn't heard of Sammy Davis Junior until ten years ago, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semiconductor collection of old CDs.
At least, Alilin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she could not remember the time when the favorite songs were not black.
Also without laws or pressure.
The voluntary company is one in which every part of it is grateful - with the gratitude of those who were happy to be saved - is in line with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Karibian origin with temperaments and constitutions threw for entertainment and athletics, and so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if they were a natural gift for electronics, took responsibility for not having a family without a functional phone.
The rest of them were installers, the Greeks, the rest of them, missing the furniture.
Those of the states of the Persian Gulf and Levant, whose ancestors quickly did not leave the country, while doing so, COSE STALO, KDYBY IT STALO - were afraid that they would accuse them of adding to the fire, in fact afraid that the fire would be burning in the future - opened up the restaurants where the labs were selling and smoking water smokes, ignored themselves and their inactivity slowly fed them.
According to his talent.
Since she only listened to the ballads, Ailin had a hard understanding of how the simple words that Kavern was just singing could produce music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They are not really empty," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden delivered a sense of security.
After the soundtracks, it couldn't even escape a word.
Ailin still didn't get it.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he managed to put two fingers in her presence again.
She thought it was weird.
"She seemed funny to him," he finally said.
Unbelievably, she shook her head and slammed Kevern's face.
There was nothing in the world that could be seen other than the mixture of her Hebrew hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she said dubiously.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
She didn't go like that.
Maybe some ankles...
You're saying you hate me because I have too thick ankles?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could've said "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles just attract me," he tried.
I'm a little shy.
That didn't happen.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got into trouble, because, like his father, he lost the spell needed to be able to break the cruelty that he had in his jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel Kavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailin Solomon's ear and she got up out of bed, she got the radio and poured out the unspoiled wine.
Besink wine, so he couldn't drink for it.
She seemed to be in her dismay like palm leaves in the storm.
"I'm really attracted to you being an asshole," she said.
Except it doesn't bother me.
She felt sorry for her unkind words, for the fear she had in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did you think she'd like to meet her?
She didn't talk to him about life on a cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but she didn't doubt that it was the same as it was here on the grounds.
The same broad and ice ocean was worried about them.
The same revolting men, then, COSE STALO, even more unbearable and hateful than their predecessors, shepherds and cassettes, bloated furiously from the house to the house, prepared to raise their hand against any woman who would dare to refuse them or mock them.
Blbec?
If he doesn't pay attention, they'll show her their fists!
First of all, helping her - helping her became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the opposite of the mad ballads of love that she loved - first helped her, then one shot at her.
According to Kever's opinion, too much culture, because the nipple was itself an act of violence.
Ailin's Solomon's verbally assigned him to leave.
He got out of bed like an old man.
She felt so cold on her own, but the silence of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She was looking at how she was leaving - as if she was watching him out of the window on the floor - a man who found out what he was doing himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart was touched because of him and for all the men in general, no matter how many of them killed her.
The man turned away from it, the shoulder hung, humiliated, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she think that this view was well known, even though she could not afford one moment until today that she would ever see it?
Ailin Solomons, on her own, looked at her feet.
About 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and excited two-year researcher working in Ofnow, an unintended public procurement monitoring system, prepared a short article on the persistence of mild and moderate violent acts in the areas of the country where its demise or direct halt was expected to be enough money and energy on its removal.
“It has done a lot and a lot more to do it,” she wrote, “to calm down the native aggression of people who fought in many battles and most of them won, and above all in the busy, hard-to-access places of the country, where even through the peaks of church towers coming out of the living plains of human grace, there was only a rare display.”
Some things, however, are irretrievable.
The higher the church tower, the lower the pudding.
The residents breathe over sentimental balloons, laugh sad stories and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas, old brutality is held as hard as in urban aglomerizations, but the evidence also shows that at home, in the workplace, roads and even in sports games, new and aggressive hostility is emerging.
"Unfortunately, you have a tendency to be too flowery," her supervisor said.
I'd suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum took her head off.
I also have to ask myself: Are you an atheist?
"I feel I don't have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme has regained her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Keep quiet.
"That's why I'm not asking," said Rabinowitz, "that I have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have any prejudices on this place.
We're serving unconnected companies.
But some kind of compassion, which is absolutely acceptable and commendable to yourself, can sometimes paint a conclusion as you have suggested.
Obviously, you are yourself bound to the Church - things that you call "hard" and "brut" could also be interpreted as expressing natural power and energy.
Keep solving what's going on, so that's going to happen, as if it happened, yesterday, he's preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
At his head on the pink light table, he drew attention to the recommendations Ofnow sent to the world in the last quarter or more.
Smile at the neighbor, watch your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicians, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than talking, singing is better than writing, but there's nothing better than love.
"I fully understand your compliments," said the quiet Esme Nussbaum, when she was sure that her superior had ended, "and I don't know that the morning was not as bad as we say she was gone.
My first concern is that if we are not aware of this in advance, we are repeating the same mistake that led to what it was, what it was, what it was, what it was.
This time, however, we will not fantasize about others.
Luther Rabinowitz tied the ends of his fingers.
That was supposed to mean endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when steps that may have been made and may not have been made by your ancestors are described as errors.
You're too far away to talk about ventilating your "fate" and "infidelity" to others.
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and in protecting our presence, we are not talking about "us" and "no."
There were no "we" and there were no "them."
We only know it was chaotic times.
"During which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme took courage, "we are no one without guilt.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, it happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this.
And just as there is no fault that could be committed to anyone, there are no things that should be corrected, no matter if the repair was appropriate and possible.
But what is the past, that we may learn from it?
There's a past to forget it.
If I can add something to that--
Luther Rabinowitz spread the ends of his fingers.
"I will take your message into account," he said and missed it.
The day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hired her on a walkway in a way that they described as "brutly and brutal."
Accidents happen.
The army of the Lesothic Kingdom claims that there is no way to plan - the president of the government remains in South Africa
Military officials of the kingdom of Lesotho denied that they would organize a guide for the purpose of the government, and claimed to have acted against the police suspected of attempting to disarm political fanatics.
The president of the government of Thomas Thabane fled the country and said that the army surrounded his official home and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maser.
After he said he was threatened with death, the Prime Minister and his family moved to the neighboring South African Republic.
Major Ntlele Ntoi's Speech Army said that it was not really a light, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics", which the police tried to arm themselves.
"Today, the command of the defenders of the Kingdom of Lesotha acted after receiving several information services reports, that several groups are in the ranks of the police who are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who are going to make a stop in the country," said the Voice of America.
Speaking to the South African government, Clayson Monyela said military action seemed like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that the government has gained power through force, according to all, actions of the Lesothian defence components bear the mark of state coup," he said.
Military representatives of the kingdom of Lesotho said that on Sunday the soldiers returned to their wives and were at peace in the capital.
During the Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothejoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
The Thabane said that he felt it was a vicious attack because of my efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane has suspended Parliament's session for internal disputes, Lesotho is in tension.
He declared that despite the opposite claim, he was not undermining his government.
Production in the euro area is at a minimum of thirteen months
Production growth has slowed down to a minimum of thirteen months, according to a carefully monitored survey in August in the euro area.
The final purchase manager index in the euro area (PMI) of June 51.8 fell to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 means expansion.
New orders were lost and the factory damaged the growing tension between the EU and Russia for Ukraine.
The figures come from the fourth meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will require a clear plan from the bank to deal with the remote recovery of the euro area and the risk of inflationary inflation of 0.3%.
The speculation has been expressed that the ECB Director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he considers the quantitative release of the euro area, similar to that of the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than any growth, the slowing effect that has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the producer is still more visible," said Rob Dobson, the leading economist of Markit.
Germany's manufacturing SME, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to a minimum of 11 months.
In the second largest economy in the area, France, SMEs fell to 46.9.
Concerns about France, Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
The knowledge that the moving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared is also not too reassuring," said Dobson.
The fall in industry is likely to lead to oil in fire analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where SMEs grew to 57,3 with the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the production overview of buyers for August is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: The eurozone producers are currently living very difficult, because increasing geopolitical tensions, especially between Russia and Ukraine, add to the increasingly demanding conditions in many countries even more uncertainty.
These increasing uncertainty in trade have proved to be effective - and above all the consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially those costly.
He stated that as "even more likely" appears that the ECB will eventually have to implement some form of quantitative release, "though we expect it to be limited."
Ten years of hell survivors from Beslan: Ten years from the threat from a school held children are still suffering
Ten years ago, the Czech radicals at the school in Beslan in southern Russia were held hostage by thousands of people
During the three days of suffering and the shock of the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the wild at school.
Just ten years after the terrible detention of the school in Beslan, where 334 people, including 186 children, were killed, were warned last night of the surviving heroes before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, they captured and killed fanatic terrorists and children, it seemed like the deepest bottom of hell.
The resistance to the tragedy linked the east and the west, which in this catastrophic disaster led to a conversation and a future.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the animal service at school.
We have found wonderful young people who have suffered misfortune, even though the memory of hell-based terrorists will live on in them.
What's their greatest wish?
So that the war that now destroys Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is already over.
A girl trying to get back into a destroyed school gym
She was captured by the leading Russian photographer Dimitry Beliakov, as only in the underwear is trying to get back into the bombed school gym after the bomb exploded in it.
The confused Aida desperately was looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
They were afraid they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"My wife told me to run away and save my life, but I couldn't," said Aida once.
I had my legs from blood.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
The soldier saved her.
After several operations, she thought she had recovered completely, but yesterday she said: “The pain came back three months ago.
I'm afraid I'll have to do another surgery.
I got a piece left on my knees.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said decisively.
"It just happened to me and it can't change.
I'm going to the gym once a year to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we're trying not to talk to our friends about it.
This pain is too big.
My best friend and future partner in Jer Gapoev's class were killed there.
As a kid, we played together, and we imagined how we would go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten her engagement, but she remembers a little pale every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world are still remembering what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet, like I'm lying in a school window, I'm saying that a lot of people will see it first, understand the disaster and stop it from happening again.
A boy who lost a rainball and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia children start school in seven years) and survived the school’s class clothing in the embrace of their mother Tamara.
At that time, a seven - year - old said, “Mother told me that if an explosion occurred, I would lie on the ground and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said, "Run."
He was afraid that she was dead, ran away, and saw the payer's boat, dropped the baby by the hand, and ran away from the spray ball.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother was dead."
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was on her way to freedom, lying in a hospital with a broken leg, and on the contrary, she thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said: “I cried for happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir later fled to London (according to missing news News of the World), where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie declared winner Bernardo's Children.
"The threat is coming back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that memories are already pale.
I remember that right after that, I threw all my guns at the game.
But today I can play computer games where they shoot, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played in the court with and they didn't get out.
Let's never say they killed them or died.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
For a trip to London, I remember well, especially how I could choose anything I wanted in the playground and how I was riding a convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine, where he suffers the same as he and his friends for the war.
The threat comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am terribly sorry for anyone who has to go through such a horror," said Damir, who took part in volunteer activities in the monastery last week.
I want a lot of help.
I want to work with the police once, and I hope they'll take me to the Academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “When 37 children are killed from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember it quietly after the attack, and there were no children who would scream and run here, and it would last for a few months.
He lives on a road with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair for her award and for the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how Damir and I helped.
I remember Damir's taste on the brush, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with the officers at the restaurant, Damir shot them with a water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And it was only a month since the threat.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think that the world has changed for the better over the past ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think it was and there's gonna be a lot of kids killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for many people, war is just something in reports that they'll hear when they're bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what people are experiencing, what it's like to be scared.
I still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice and quiet boy, he's not even aggressive or stubborn.
For example, he doesn't apply for revenge, he doesn't even care about it.
I know she doesn't like to remember that, but she's got a lot close to six partners and she's going to the gym from time to time and they're burning candles in there.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - I remember how he used to lie on a couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes he used to lie for hours.
He didn't sleep, he had open eyes.
I also remember that he threw out all his guns or other weapons to play. Damir is 17, is higher today than I am, pretty, smart and healthy.
It's hard to believe that I've been sure for hours that he's dead and that I'll never see him again.
When I woke up after the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw hell, and there were pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my boyfriend didn't have a hell of a chance to survive.
“I remember shouting, “Damire, run, run!” but I was convinced that I did not hear.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives are different from others.
Grigory Ilyn, 17
The boy whose photograph was taken after the attack became a symbol of threat in Beslan
Congratulation: Survive from Beslan Grigorij Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, the Grigorij right today
When he ran away from life after a Czech terrorist shot his associates, there was a fear in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the beast in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, put him in school the first day and rushed to take her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists knocked on the door, so my boyfriend stayed there for three days alone," she recalled.
Not entirely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
He only survived my Grigory.
As the date approaches, it's still harder to think about and talk about it.
It won't even take a day to remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem like it's happened long ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Photo Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was preserved as socha (right)
I remember when Grigory was very excited about school that day, he said he wanted to cover up his teacher.
That he's alive, I found out when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino there's even Grigory's tears.
Grigory likes the picture, and we have her hidden in the library at home.
I understand that, but I also think that because of this picture, people around the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: “It is important not to repeat this anymore.
“I doubt that we will ever learn the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever find the truth.
Now they're investigating the Boeing accident in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused it?
This world is waiting for something too bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because when you ask people, they don’t want war, how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget a little bit, it takes ten years.
It had an impact on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years I had a nightmare attack, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I've been thinking about my friends and associates who were killed.
That's why when it comes to September 1st, I'm going to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of a childhood friend.
It's hard for me to get into that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is history.
I won't forget it, but I don't.
My life is going on.
I finished school this year and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiosurgeon.
First I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't for health reasons.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Gregory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived, though kept him at the foot of a killer terrorist
A miracle: Gregory Farniyev was kept at the foot of a killer terrorist during the attack, yet he managed to survive
When he was attacked in a full-flow, he was arrested in a gym, sitting next to the bomb at the foot of a killer terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It seems to us like it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent, but because of the injury he suffered during the attack, he couldn't.
It's still with me, it's not something I put in my head.
Now I'm older and it's said that children with bad experiences can arrange better - I have to say, it's not true.
"In 2006, I went to a psychologist and then I was a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - year later - it was the first and last thing I entered the gym again.
I'm late.
I'll never go there again and please don't want me to show you where I'm sitting on that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on the notebook with his photograph taken in the hospital after the attack
This pain is huge, and I don't have it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me at school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I've got to be careful about my knee, which I've been working on, but I'm walking normally.
But I couldn't get up and study at the FBS Academy in Petrohrad as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they told me it's not possible.
My other target is animals, so I went to the vet.
I made a second year out there.
It teaches how to treat all the animals from the "big after cow".
He said: “I know that I will never tell my children about it.
It's not something children should know about, and it's not something they should live with.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “The pain will still be here.
He's in there and he's getting worse with the next year.
I'm participating in the commemorative ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was different from me.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory's grown up today, but the threat goes on.
It's hard to accept when something so awfully unjust happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's undergone several operations, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say that's how 50% he's already overcome that fear, but he's going to overcome it completely and not forget it.
This terrible experience will be with us all the time.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors were killed and the pain only worsened.
I lost a lot of people that I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and it's the greatest gift God could give me, but I'm in pain of losing the dead.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows who have not remarried.
It's hard to assume that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart nearly jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I see what's going on in the world -- wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now getting closer to our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we've been a friendly country, so how did we get into fighting together now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could just take all those rebels and throw them away, as long as it doesn't work.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
Child who took to safety special command
Saved: Alyon Tskaev is taken to the Russian security special team (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't even remember the tragedy.
In 2004, the world was swallowed by a breath when a little Alyon was delivered in a handgun from the Beslanian occupation of the Russian police.
The terrorists abandoned her, but left her 30-year-old mother, Kristina’s ten-year-old sister, and Brother Makhara in the school gym.
Makhar, who was then three years old, disappeared, but Alyon's mother and sister died at the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and had a little girl named Kristina after her dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, doesn't even remember the attack and grew up to be a bright and happy girl.
A close friend said that “it is a great happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great children.”
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep the children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary recalls.
You can understand why.

4 types, how to order better photos and videos under water
If you are interested in drawing or filming under the water, you have a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact, for example Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which is about $300.
I ordered these photos at the family party a few photos, all of them worth less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, but several rules apply to achieving the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
Next set the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will set up.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or filming mode that optimizes exposure to the dark environment under the water.
And before you get into it, find out how deep you can get with your equipment.
Some cameras are only intended for 5 feet, others up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by buying and evaluating digital cameras in regular and waterproof implementation.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them won't come out.
Compact cameras have LCDs that help you with the composition photos, but the outdoors don't have it.
Even if you have LCD, it's going to be wrong to see the water and the composition of the picture will be unpredictable.
So you're always making more pictures.
If the camera has a Bracketing mode that makes a series of images with a slightly different resolution of the exposure, use it.
Stay close to the cold.
With deeper light, she's dying.
If possible, stay in the swimming pool, lake or sea close to the cold.
It will also allow you to capture more light on the photos - the deeper you sink, the less color you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
It's a great advice if you're taking a picture of the drought, but the water is even more important because of the darker light.
It is especially important if you are filming with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a solid and wide angle of the corner, which means that if you want to fill a photoframe, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality power has even changed things into a huge organization like NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he has given his career the opportunity to remove the disease caused by illness and treatment to the sick.
His wife remembers that one of the people who sought his help was an officer of MI6, who had to live with the consequences of the torture that had cost him his life.
Lawson realized that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disease, patients treated in the liver usually care for something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt powerless.
He was dealing with the symptoms of the flu and found out that he was impatient and his wife, Juliet, was involved in the riots.
He said, "I want everything to be done sooner than later."
When Juliet went on a service trip for a week, Lawson was unusually upset.
Something wasn't right.
His colleague made him an X-ray.
A couple of weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results came in.
He had mesothelioma, an irreparable tumor that affects the chest or the lungs.
In most cancers, it is difficult to determine what was their cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer have smoked.
But there's a different mezotel.
In almost all cases, the cause of the exposure of asbestos - the construction of fibre material, which was previously referred to as "beautiful", but today it is known to be fatally dangerous.
For most of us, it wasn't hard to ignore mejotels.
Azbeth, finally, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in Britain since the 1960s when it entered into force the ban on the use of asbestos in industry.
Even when asbestos was used, only a few groups of people, such as insulators, builders, treasurers, and workers, came into close contact with it.
Toxin used in the industry in another era today is hardly a cause for concern.
But such selfishness is not in place.
As it turns out, in Britain today, the mesothelioma epidemic is over.
The number of deaths in mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2 500 deaths per year are twice as many as the number of car accidents.
Number of deaths on mesothelioma annually since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in the United Kingdom
The reason why we now feel its effects, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos have finally been banned in 1999), is that it usually lasts several decades before mesothelis develops.
The mesothelioma is not just about the veterans of the construction industry.
Azbeth was, and in many cases still is, present in homes where we live, in offices where we work, in schools where we learn, and in shops where we buy.
So mesothelioma does not respect the social level, wealth, employment, or age.
The privileged gardens from London's commercial homes after the public school do not appear to hide.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are the storage of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even put in isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he could come in contact with asbestos.
Then he came to it.
"It's possible that a lot of asbestos was in the underground corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All students, sisters, doctors and returnees used walks.
The question is, how many of my peers get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question he was able to answer in part.
"For four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital who then showed up to mesothelioma in the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17th this year, he was 55.
Living with this diagnosis is not common for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
Weakness is always mortal.
Now, then, can we just repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us are sick with the same illness?"
According to a leading British expert on the mesothelioma of Professor Julian Peta, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic takes place in Britain, about 90,000 people die.
Most of them at present have no idea that they die in this way.
Azbesto's share in Quebec, Canada
On a regular review of the records from the archives of the courts, on which the injuries often turn and require reconciliation, it shows how much mesothelioma has spread.
For example, this red woman admitted to Marks & Spencer that she had exposed the asbestos to Janice Allen out of care.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she watched two sales in the clothing section - one of the places was a flagship company, a business on Oxford Street.
Allen's was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today she has two children who have more than 20.
"I've never heard of mesothelioma before," he says, "I've hardly known anything about asbestos.
I've never even been dreaming that he might have something to do with me.
There are not many people who know about asbestos.
Actually, there's not one substance but a group of six minerals.
His name was given thanks to his fibrosic structure, which gives him strength and propriety.
Three of the six minerals were used in construction.
The most common is the chrysotil in buildings today, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, bowling bars and even in a brake lining.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, however, the EU and WHO consider it "a great health risk", which can cause death.
More dangerous, but it's brown asbestos and blue asbestos.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of raw asbestos, and experts claim that “there is convincing, but indirect evidence that it was the main cause of an unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom].”
Employee Marsk & Spencer has been exposed to asbestos in the railway sale at Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen may not consider himself a typical mejotel victim, but Julian Peta's work indicates that her story is not unusual at all.
His patient study argues that “a significant part of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exposure is caused by the "normal use and increase" of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that he's safe.
The report Goddard Consulting, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government do not have to realize that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that says that service elevators and pipes behind the seats of the parliamentary committee are contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be damaged by something as harmless as "a strong airflow".
Ministers are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but in this case it can be the opposite of the truth.
Although Parliament's services were insisting that the Westminster Palace would receive a "good medical certificate", it is now calculated that it will require one million pounds and several years of work to be thoroughly examined by Parliament, modernized and removed asbestos, and that, after the 2015 elections, the MPs will sit rather than in green homes in Westminster in the premises of Queen Elizabeth's Conference Centre II.
The report of Goddard states that "the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several rules."
It's not possible to say that this mess will be a lifetime.
Everybody can only wait now.
One person who was never able to determine when the asbestos exposure was present is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) is suspected of being exposed to asbestos at work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was proven," he says, "but in my case I can't prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places where he worked, and when he worked there.
Of course, he remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when something hit him like a cold.
He was 45, he was the night and he was just in the middle of the surgery.
I broke up all of a sudden.
It's a lie.
It was terrible.
I didn't think I'd drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the chest, the joints around the lungs.
But just like Janice Allen, he had no reason to think it was a mejotel.
After all, he spent a month at home.
The confused doctors made him an X-ray and took him out of the lung to remove the fluid they sent for discussion.
Still, they didn't determine the diagnosis.
His condition improved slowly and he went back to work.
From time to time, though, his symptoms returned, often after he practiced and breathed.
In 2011, one of the Abbott patients came to the operating room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older, and in work he got in direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor consulted his CT images and X-rays with the panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, he was in the space between a chest dutina and a lung implanted probe equipped with a camera.
I'm optimistic.
I tend to take nothing too much," he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy came between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it's a mejotel."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began to meet with the Macmillan charity sisters and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At this point, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It has been shown that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos heat insulation in the tube," he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now beginning to show up.
So mesothelioma is now becoming a concern of younger people who do not have a risk call.
The most dangerous tubes of heat-insulated asbestos were found in hospitals in the basement, so it was unlikely that patients would be at risk.
However, personnel who walked underground between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground meals (such as Graham Abbott) are certainly in contact with the toxic substance.
As it turns out, several decades after the war, the hospital was a place where patients could save their lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
Azbeth is removing himself to this day.
The students of Bunsen's kahan built on the asbestos floors
And it's not just a hospital.
Azbeth was often used in offices, shops, libraries and workshops because of his excellent isolation and non-heating properties.
At school, too.
In fact, many people have already been exposed to asbestos at school.
In countless hours of chemistry, students built Bunsen's khan on the asbestos floor.
The website was raised on the question of asbestos in schools.
Undefeated things like floor tiles or roofs of tools in our homes usually contained asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison built into a large number of homes," noted Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his complaint against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma was able to remember in the 70 ’ s when she was fighting a garden home.
So be careful how you beat the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of diagnosis is huge.
"It takes a while before you do," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I had to leave and arrange for myself.
Well, I can't get another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the doctor's position to the patient's position.
As a countless number of patients before him, he remembers how he felt confused with the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
I've been told that for twelve months.
I remember saying, “Well, I don’t enjoy the next Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive, because the only mechanism that keeps us alive - the breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by the exposure of asbestos.
Azbeth is a small fiber.
When the asbestos is broken and the fibers are inhaled, they can sit in the trunk, the lungs.
Azbes' fiber jars are fertilizing and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is an inspired asbestos fiber in the shape of a needle," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiosurgeon who arrived at Guy's Hospital in 2001.
In the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is a paradoxical center for mesothelioma treatment.
Treasure Lawson also knew and treated other patients who had been exposed to asbestos during practice in the hospital.
Assassins get into the lung tissue, says Treasure, and “soul breathing is pressured to the edge where the exhibit is located.
From the very beginning, he's been invasive.
In mesothelioma, the usual treatment options used in other types of cancer do not take so much.
The fire is discussed, for example, on the effectiveness of the operation.
According to some, she'd be trying.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the groceries," he says.
You won't get around her scalpel.
Cancer "too does not respond to chemotherapy", which has "some effect", but does not cure.
“Sometimes someone who survives lung cancer occurs,” says Treasure.
But in the end, they're all gonna die.
Fortunately, some patients live a long time longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years since his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After finding mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and advice for the same affected people.
When they called, he was happy to introduce himself: “Good day, you called at the cancer center.”
"Was very positive," said Abbott.
He was diagnosed with weakness four years ago and was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months, and probably only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give it up.
Lawson, however, "was able to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the breast surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage that I didn't have to wait until I was sent to him, but I just called there and they looked at me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get an application and have to accept his compensation.
For patients with mesothelioma, the key question is to get the best treatment available.
But when different treatments are finally inevitable, many patients face another financial elder - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to court and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health," says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even his very small amount could pose a health risk.
And this is where we meet a fat company.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled, but according to Morgan, it wasn't a "full-scale settlement", because Lawson couldn't definitely prove that the mejotels were the result of the exposure of asbestos in Guy's Hospital.
However, after the case was investigated, the speaker Guy's Hospital confirmed that "the confusion in the incriminating subterranean part was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Maintaining the exposure of fatal asbestos to one firm or place of work - usually decades after it happened - has proved to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma who strive for compensation.
Many former jobs have changed or damaged the owner.
Evidence of insurance's gone.
And those who, now, defend themselves, have their own time, and certainly their accusers do not.
In response to this fact, this year an important new legislation has been approved, which makes it easier for patients with mesotelium to settle, even if it is not possible to search for their former employer.
The law created a 350 million financial reserve, which is built by insurance companies, which is designed for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to complain about.
In such a case, they will receive 80 % of the amount that the court would normally assign to them as compensation - about 120,000 pounds.
Every year 300 successful requests are expected.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma, believes that 350 million pounds is "good work".
"It is an agreement signed by insurance companies," he says and indicates that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if time and people with mesothelioma were able to feed ex-employers and normalize them.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "had gaps."
But Penning and Morgan admit that, in view of the seven deaths each year, quick negotiations were needed.
"People are too suffering and need help right away," Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the law on mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was in charge of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After the initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended the operation that he thought had a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
After surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were followed by a three-fold treatment that can lead to long-term survival of up to 40% of patients.
Abbott made it stronger.
"Of course, that's not the most important thing," said Abbott.
You still see it in patients.
There's something going on with you.
If you give up, your attitude can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott took part in the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last six cycles of chemotherapy.
Control checks showed no signs of disease.
I went to another check in March [2014].
In my chest, I had a few broken ribs.
My 50th birthday was just getting closer.
It's not a life threat.
Just him.
Abbott re-entered six cycles of chemotherapy.
There's no trace of the tumor in his body right now.
But it's a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or to show my wife how the wake-up works.
When you get bad news, you start being negative.
You have to look forward.
As for Fathers Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14) it is not always simple.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition means I'll never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly we started calling a lot of people.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
All patients with cancer have to face this kind of conversation.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not delayed by hope or just a sign of survival.
Unpower brings with it (and finally brings with it Stephen Jay Gould) unsatisfying certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "life is not a threat to mejotels."
The bodies of the embellished Pharaohs are packed into the asbestos coat.
Azbest fibers are used to strengthen the grills for cooking and increase resistance to fire.

He won't pay any compensation.
During the 2nd world war, ships are intensively built, and the work in ships represents the highest risk of exposure to asbestos.
Prohibition of imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful appeal for health damage as a result of the exposure of asbestos in Britain.
The world's production of asbestos increases to more than 4,213,000 tons a year.
The United Kingdom imports 139 000 tonnes.
The British Institute for Health and Safety requires all suppliers of asbestos to be licensed.
The importation and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited in Britain by law.
The use of all kinds of asbestos is prohibited in Britain.
The law on mesothelioma shall enter into force in the United Kingdom.
A 350 million compensation program has been launched.
Azbeth is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbestos continues to be used as cheap building material.
World production is maintained for two million tons a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong authority to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
In spite of the numerous discussions on democratic reform on Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections.
This step is likely to result in long-term promised protests in Hong Kong's commercial district, as activists began to organize and capture only a few hours after this announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress basically allows Communist leaders to issue any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"It may not surprise us, but it upset us," said legislator Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it's clear that we have something to do with the authoritarian regime.
In defence of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fei, said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain returned China to Hong Kong's administration, Beijing has promised that it will begin in 2017, the citizens will be able to choose the executive power.
The Chinese leaders presented the Sunday decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong allows direct voting, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders hold firmly to the process of appointing a committee, which is closely controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which marked one of the biggest and most followed protests in Hong Kong for several years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are held by the occupation of the Centre with love and peace, whose organizers threatened to close the financial quarter unless Beijing gives them a general voting right.
On Sunday night, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of beneficiaries of the occupation movement gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers announced that their movement is entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that the wave of protests will be launched in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, obviously they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the Centre only as a last step in the event that all dialogue options were exhausted and no choice would arise.
We need to announce with the policing that today all options for dialogue have been exhausted and the detention of the Centre is inevitable.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing themselves for Beijing's announcement all day and on Sundays have strengthened the protection of the government's headquarters and set up police and barricades.
In many Hong Kong residents, causing disturbances is a sign that they are slowly losing control of the city.
The arrival of people from the fortress increases competition in the field of products and services.
They are also concerned that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are increasing by pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the movement of the occupation of the Central and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - the Hong Kong rescue ship.
"The protest he talks about could cause much greater economic damage, according to how many people are involved and for how long," says politician Regina Ip, who criticises the long-term movement.
We don't want the fears of Hong Kong getting out of control.
Such an attitude could damage investment.
The Chinese state media has also reported in recent days that democratic activists in Hong Kong see as subversive agents in the west.
In the summer, activists organized an informal referendum on voting rights, with 780,000 participants, more than five in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.
A pre-election agitka?
The League in Jihlava bears the name according to political movement
In the village of Vysočina, a small hill is played by some 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their highest competition is again called Common League for Jihlava.
The name was given according to one movement that goes into October's municipal elections.
He's also the boss of the little digger in Jihlava, Jan Mrák.
"There was a mob where there was no problem with that," the Dark said.
The situation around the first league of small dignitaries has already been addressed by the lawmakers of the Yugoslavian Council and recommended changing the system of distribution of grants.
A small miner won the city's website last year about a million crowns.
And this year, it's about the amount in hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure is not small-scaled in contradiction with the law or the guidelines of the magistrate.
The situation is, however, an incentive for the Office to amend the rules for granting grants and grants," Radek Tulis spokesperson Radek Tulis said.
Drop a grant from the city and at the same time express as a small-scale support in the elections of one political party, it will probably not go away.
A similar requirement from politicians has not yet come to the high-level "great" football.
That ČSSD should be generated by a country change, ODS division or KDU-CHSL 1.
And the class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be for that.
On the contrary, I would be pleased if sponsors from a number of companies were to turn to us," noted the president of the local football team Miroslav Vrzáček.
The leader of the small football party and the move to the name of the league will not leave
According to players, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own area with six toys, dresses and social facilities.
"For example, the game on the stairs is not ours, we are there for rent," Ondřey Lapeš of the Starlet Jihlava Club warned.
The most suitable locality would be the Czech mill.
But there will be built, for example, in my opinion, a foolish area for skates, which are about fifty in Jihlava," Mr.
Primátor Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that the small bath uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Rosky and On Stoopách, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build a playground that has maximum use.
We are going to modernise or build sports gardens at schools that will be available in the afternoon hours.
I think that in recent years, for a small bath, huge progress has been made," Vymazal added.
The other political parties in the name of the league do not appear according to Jan Mráky.
We have limitations.
If someone in one area joins us, we don't do the other anymore," he explained.
"Political movement in the name of the league, I consider it a least unfortunate step," said a member of the Advisory Committee on Sport Karel Voldán.
"But let the voters assess whether Mr. Mrák is using a small company digging in Jihlava and helping the city for political purposes, or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates into university life - the first can fly by plane
We are pleased that we can respond to the request by releasing the first luxury travel services for students in Britain.
For the sake of avoiding the best impressions on arrival at the university, the company also offers the possibility of transporting a private driver or a Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service has its own security page.
Service is the ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their things across the entire state in a dangerously loaded car.
We are pleased that with our VIF (very important hairdresser - very important element) variants this year, we will ensure that students arrive at the university with minimum nervousness and maximum luxury.
Speaking society said that, given that the services had just dropped down, they had no reservations yet, but he added: “Students will start making reservations over the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that although students pay their annual school fees of 9,000 pounds, they expect the service to be placed on the market.
Compared to ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today's students are different with regard to expectations and desires - it's more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve it.
The National Union of Students, however, criticized the service as irreconcilable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is inaccessible.
Many students who attend this month's university have to cope with the financial crisis before spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as getting on the track, because available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep pace with rising costs for basic needs.
Feminists face racism and police behaviour after the Ferguson incident
At the beginning of the month, a policeman in Ferguson killed an unarmed young man in Missouri.
And those who wait for the burial with their hands up to heaven will say: "Rise up, do not shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson in Missouri for the shooting of unarmed young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz's movement recorded in the online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer sex before race.
With increasing tensions in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the national press, Peréz observed that the whites' reaction is 100 % focus on race.
Compared to the reactions of black people shortly after the 9th of August, personal articles with headlines such as “the idea of whitening over Ferguson” or “Feminism is not only about women’s suppression” were found relatively late.
According to Perez, however, this is an important change.
"I don't think there's a lot of people in feminist movement who would talk about race and prejudice at such a level," she said.
People felt that what happened had to be said.
For the crisis we face, it is characteristic because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially protected that they have to warn.
According to English professor at the University of State at Ohio, the Mitchell University of Corinth, Ferguson, highlighted the problems that African Americans have to face every day and that are not perceived as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish funny stories from my life with my partner on Facebook and get 150 people from people around the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about coloring in my own country in captivity, it's a silence.
"How is it possible that a woman can talk publicly about relationships, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For blacks like Mitchell, who dealt with the question of race, sex and sexuality in American history, there are no issues between race and sex dichotomy.
According to it, black people could not afford luxury to share these problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although the Whites today question of race and sex in mainstream feminist circles are intertwined, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's questions and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors have done something wrong.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black people were lynched and the reason for almost all cases of white violence,” Hattery said.
For reasons of lynching, you needed to cooperate with the whites.
According to Hattery, the gap between the whites and the blacks came when fighters for election rights such as Susan B. Anthony studied at the end of the 19th century field and realized that election rights could have only one group of people - women or blacks.
“They decided to place their cards on women’s voting rights and to focus on blacks later,” Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important view of why colorful women don't believe in white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black people protect their husbands and children.
Even after women were granted election rights in 1920, it took ten years to organize anti-lying in the Southern Women's Association to prevent lynching.
The group came up 40 years after the blacks first said they were helping.
According to Mitchell, the response of white feminists to the questions raised in Ferguson - the question of police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "get" the questions faced by the blacks of the generations.
"Would it not be great if activists in these areas [traditional feminism] had the right to raise a child just as seriously as they had the right to an anti-conception?" Mitchell said.
The second wave of feminists who have made a career in combating reproductive rights and access to anti-conception are now finding out what that means.
Significant feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown's attack on Facebook, where they published Rebecca Carroll's column from the Guardian, which required the white Americans to protest more firmly against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but still similar reasons for understanding dangers in society - and opinions on race that differ significantly in public opinion - will try to change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for cross-sectional feminism, which includes issues of race and sex, her comments on the question of race in America are made by some mothers.
Experts from the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of the book "Who stole feminism?", told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men, are "a lot more vulnerable than their sisters", but comments by the Steinem Party of Ferguson are facing criticisms that she had already called.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program of My Brother's Keeper, which had the help of vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it caused many feminists, including Gloria Steinem's angry reaction.
The police's attitude to the black community is not the only problem that is being overcome by the interest of mainstream feminism.
After the US foreign police held almost 63,000 young people in the South-West this year without a follow-up, the question of reforming immigration laws was raised again - this time as a female question.
Andrea Mercadová, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilising women for the reform of immigration laws, said that, in order to present the question as necessary for women, the only thing she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"He speaks for himself," says Mercadová.
In view of the fact that most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them are encouraged in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have an announcement in women's organisations," she said.
Farmhouse in Ipswichi for sale
The real office removed the image of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, it was resting on it in a pig's living room.
A single-room house, which is for sale for 120,000 pounds, is on a private trip to Ipswichi.
Information photographs included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on the pig’s bed.
The real Connells office stated that the pig on the photo is a pet pet pet.
"The photo went wrong, and that's why it was already removed," the speaker's office said.
In the property information, the real estate office Connells described the former prayer as "the only single single room house."
Although the photo office has already been removed from its website, promotional materials still appear.
The sale of the house caused interest on social networks, where some asked whether the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, Harvey has a city in the southwestern part of the world.
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
The search for a new millionaire in the south-east of Perth is ongoing, and one lucky man from Saturday's lottery draw will take 1.1 million dollars.
Traffic in Harvey has been in luck for over five years, last November 2009 was a win of one million dollars.
Well, an honest winner just needs to sign up.
The owner of the store Steve Forward said he was talking about winning the whole city on the Southwest of Perth.
It's the main theme, and they're all upset.
We thought a similar victory was a touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia divided one victory last month, ending several happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of five August's millionaires and only a few weeks ago in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning twins sat down for 20 years and said the win would allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
Harvey's millionaire is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, totaling $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains won't leave tonight.
Engineers want higher wages
The GDL in the press release marked a protest for a warning station for which it was approved to select time outside the transport point.
At the selected time, the GDL takes a look at many people who come back from the weekend after the railway to the first working day.
At the same time, we also think about people who are on their way to work during the day," the board said on Monday morning in a press release to report the statement.
"Our first stop should affect, above all, freight transport, less passengers," added the GDL.
DB has not yet published an official response to the statement.
It is not even clear how protests will affect international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The committees require an increase of five per cent among engineers and a reduction in working hours for two hours a week.
At present, the average wage of engineers varies between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) annually, depending on the years worked.
Engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to join the increase in wages when the working time is reduced.
They stress, however, that the wage evaluation of drivers must be developed as well as for other railway personnel with whom DB is not counted as a minimum working week.
She threatened to burn Christ's car.
That's why Barum Rallye ended up.
What exactly happened?
It's about material fraud.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think anything like that could happen.
Didn't the leak temporarily repair and continue in a slower pace to the service where the mechanics would exchange it?
If we were to go straight there, yes.
But we were still waiting for two more essays, and it didn't work.
There's a high temperature in it, and the risk that the car would start burning was big.
I can't afford that.
You've had five speed tests in full.
What do you think of them?
Very good.
I felt like a miscarriage.
We were fast, but I didn't go through the wine.
Everything was caused by the car we've had more than half a year to be at some level.
The competition proved to be a success.
You spread it so you could really think about winning.
I made myself a car so we really had a win.
Work didn't come abroad.
On the other hand, the result that we could think of did not come to light.
But it's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one of the peaks that got out of the championship fight.
They've come out of him and the foreign favorites of Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Did it surprise you that so many favorites have gone away?
Yes.
Especially for the spectators, it was a shame because the race ended early.
Jaromír Tarabus, who you're going to drive, has been on the tip for a long time.
He just paid for flying out of the track and picked up a nearly two-minute gap.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's a shame because he could repeat the degrees of the winners.
He's been driving the first second time.
But Mira also confirmed that the car was good.
He's very fast.
Just a year ago you announced the end of your career, although you showed up at the beginning of Barum rally.
Can you feel good driving again making a regular participant in the rally races?
I'm sure not right now.
Last year I said Barumka was my last race, and I didn't get it anyway.
I decided I'd go again.
It was my nineteenth start, and when it's over in a year, I'll probably go.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people have come to the loss just because of you.
Did it please you?
To some extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's up with you guys after Barumce?
The team continues.
Next week we'll go to Vyskov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
In addition to this race, we want to borrow from Honz Sykor's fab.
Mirou and I are waiting for a European competition in Switzerland and in Corsica.
We're gonna have to catch things next year.
Can you point something out?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsica rally was part of the world's championship, the fifth place you reached your maximum in the series.
Doesn't it make you try the dark track again?
Don't laugh.
The oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not let your doctor confirm your inability to work, which serves as evidence for the organization that you cannot perform your duties for health reasons.
Moreover, you did not immediately notify the employer of the absence.
As a result, the agreement was concluded that the days in question would be shown as a holiday, but the agreement only went orally.
Although the employer does not have the obligation to have a written confirmation of the employer's consent to the discharge, in practice this procedure has been certified.
If it only comes to the oral agreement, you don't have a confirmation agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the discharge may be considered as a long-term unannounced absence, as well as in your case, and therefore the reason for the immediate termination of the working conditions in accordance with § 53 of the Act of Employment.
In the case of a judicial dispute with your employer, there is no manifest evidence.
However, the working relationship with you has not been deleted in accordance with § 53, you have only the days specified in the accounting list as an unannounced absence.
Undeclared absences in the balance sheet do not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the inability to obtain substantial unemployment insurance), although it is difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and let yourself be confirmed in writing that there has indeed been a fall, as a result of which you have been unable to work (sometimes called "insomnia", it is just a doctor's document).
When looking for a new job, you can present that document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the presentation of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, the rapid notification of the employer or the request for written consent to be granted.
You're avoiding any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his way back
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just a bit behind half the Atlanta Motor Speedway racetrack.
Stewart suddenly hit the game after he broke his right front tire in 172, and the race for him ended.
Stewart drove a ruined car to the garage, didn't show up to the reporters and left.
The leader of his team, Chad Johnston, said the car number 14 was disappointed, but will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I would like us to have better performance and a better conclusion," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and we'll hope we get more.
Stewart went to the play first in the Sunday evening competition after a ride with Kyle Bush, which demanded to repair his car's right side.
"To today's race, we put in hopes for a good marriage," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at the New York race, Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to get a place in the table.
He returned to the race during a tragic accident investigation, where 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who took Stewart to the race.
The authorities said that the investigation of the cause of the accident would take at least two weeks.
So far it hasn't been decided whether Stewart would face any charges.
A three-way champion was facing a hot boost before the race.
Stewart started at 12. At the start of the race he worked at 10 and then even at 4.
Then, at the beginning of 122nd wheel, Bush's car no.
18 got out of control, got out of the second gear and came to Stewart, and sent both of them to the fence.
Stewart went on, but he got to the 21st place.
Prague has chosen a new taxi manager, making 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for a new taxi manager.
In 103 parking stations, about 12.3 million crowns are earned annually.
In the meantime, 150 thousand crowns were selected each year for the same seats for the cab driver.
He briefed the Council of Lukás Manhart (TOP 09).
The city used to be used for the selection of administrators.
The winner then got a rent for a lump sum of 1000 crowns a year.
But the rules have changed.
At present, he is deciding on the highest bids.
"The year since the termination of the original leases and the start of the selection procedures has shown that the new rental system is far more beneficial and generally fairer for Prague," the Council said.
The most expensive spot is on the Perchtín
The highest price was offered by interested parties on the street of Na Perštín.
He'll pay 2.1 million crowns a year.
About 1.5 million crowns were paid by new managers for seats in front of the General House or in Václav Square.
The new rental rules of the tax office were adopted in the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year the original lease contracts were declared.
The selection process took place in four waves and a new manager found 29 posts.
We had to clean up the cold for another year.
Every time we let her out, a practically second fisherman came up around the chat.
Then we poured Savo in there.
Incredulous smell!
Our fridge in the cellar has always tasted plenty of beautiful drinking water.
And it wasn't someone who's been professionally made, Grandpa gave her help.
Long time ago.
She was just on three laps and totally weird, like the rest of it was on the cabin, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until the summer.
When we started the season, of course, we drained the water.
When she got there a couple of months, she deserved it.
But then it seemed to us that the water was not working.
We were wondering if anything was going down there.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible in a bit of laughter, the board was not quite long enough, so the door was locked with a piece of silence.
Our inspection confirmed that it was still moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing to see in the water, and we lit it to the bottom.
So we let her out again and cleaned her up.
Of course, we improved the improvised tension around the pump tube.
We noticed strange things in the shop.
He was lying on the ground with some bones.
At least it looked like that.
And another piece.
Now it looked like an ostentatious mouse.
At the ceiling, in the places where the rivers, the grandfathers found, there were the rest of the fish!
And it's hard to ride!
Our store's awesome, too.
Someone would have said that his grandfather was in the chat room for a while.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and floors are just a breathless sand, only the ceiling is covered.
They're giving them the main ship.
And the car.
And a beach bed.
The door with wide spaces was mostly open as someone walked there in one piece.
At the ceiling several of those already mentioned.
No network, so they usually fly in there and put a nest on the trams.
It's unnecessary to mention mice.
Dad wanted it to fight, and that's it.
Now, however, the air didn't help.
The whole store smelled.
So we cleaned up the whole store.
In particular, the fish on the tram was nutritious!
We also threw out things that were around us: wood, heraclytic board, and so on.
Our chat on the far side welcomed a nearby disinfectant.
We've been thinking about who could've pulled the disgusting remains out there?
The nearest cat lives two miles from here all over.
It would be hard for us to have a shower.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not completely okay.
If this Frant didn't get us the shit out of it, did he?
He's been here practically a year, stupid ideas, he's got it.
We decided to watch the shop and check the refrigerator regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so long as we were just cleaning and washing before the tests were finished, but it was good.
Tossing water from a forest studio is nothing I'd like to do for a long time.
One day we heard a terrible nightmare of our pheasants.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw a long black shark in the grass next to the veranda.
The shirt jumped over her, and she peeped like a fool.
Her mother had come out because she thought Réza had taken a dump out of the laundry.
All of a sudden, though, the hectic slips into the club and partially straightens out.
The balcony's been hit.
The line got hysterical arrest.
We ran down.
The narrow, long over a meter and fat as a bull, was about to swallow a giant oil and Réza was defending it.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the oil or if she wanted to eat it alone, but that was irrelevant.
When she saw the force in the form of our entire family, she probably said that we would eat it when we were so hungry, and she made her way to the store.
We flew after her.
It's like a blizzard jumping for the cold.
Just by the way, we've recorded on her desk another smelly package.
According to the smell of fish.
She wasn't there last night!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a boss.
And that's what we closed the store in the day.
That he would...
We went out, and we got each of us into one stream.
We haven't waited a long time.
It's a shame for the cold.
A flat head first appeared with yellow moons on its neck.
Then the whole thing fell to the cold.
She wrapped around the pump and started getting inside.
An ex-employer bought a notebook and sold it to the company.
The poor employee bought it on the computer company after the release and then sold it.
The money you got came to waste before the police were arrested.
During a short time, a man bought in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"After taking the notebook, he drove to Olomouce, where he sold it after the bazaars," said the top commissioner of the Spanish police Rostislav Brückner.
The reason for the fraud was the employer's release and also the profit of the money.
"In the hearing, he claimed that he used the money for loan payments," Brückner said.
The police have also found that a cheater is a pathological player who has repeatedly been treated for psychiatric purposes.
The money could also end in the winning devices or in the video lottery terminals.
"The fact is we didn't find any money with him," said the Commissioner.
A subjugator who has been sentenced to theft for one year to five years now threatens to remain in prison.
The police haven't told you that they're threatening to punish even the bazaars who bought the notebooks at the price and then sold them.
"It is true that they have completely taken over the new goods, which is at least suspected," said the Commissioner.
However, none of the owners of the pool have been charged so far.
Come on, another bit, you can handle it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague.
This year, our orders have made a number of changes.
This was the biggest change in the route that brought the target to the sail, instead of leading back to the Yellow Ladders.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of Rungo.cz team, but I was going to spend it a little bit on the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally heal our readers at the station, where we took pictures and filmed videos together.
To get my view on the other side to perfection, I took the role of a personal guide.
Together with a friend of Káča, we carefully arranged for the end of the corridor between 60 and 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted friends who went around us into the fast-track sector.
There's not much time left.
A few jumps on the heat, turn on sports tests, count and start!
The ice shouts, but instead of a quick start, the purchase to the start line followed.
After five minutes, we go to the gate, stop the measurements, and start at ten o'clock.
We propose a yellow hat of runners who, like Kata, run their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, slowly lowering the sun in the sky gives a view of the Vyšehrad almost to the hump.
It looks like the whole Praha is running here.
On the coast between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally beginning to show who has the strength.
A light doll on the Palack square forces many runners to slow down or move on.
Just before I go to the divadelna, I see police escorts and immediately follow him at an incredible pace.
I hear a strange breath of breath of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's going to cry with me, but right before that, he's gonna bend my leg and our hands are running out.
The Divadelní street offers a chance for a short rest and relaxation.
There's a need for places in front of us where my outlook is going to give me a breath.
The tower on the Manes Bridge shows Prague in the beauty of the sunset.
I'm not breathing, and my legs are almost alone.
For the first anniversary, there's a moment of truth.
At the crossing of the road, the Cat takes care of the eyebrows and carries out the leap of the swim.
I see if he doesn't need help, and I'm dropping a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
We get up and continue in the street of Koz, it's one of the narrowest places of the track, at this stage of the race, although there's no such suit, but there's a need to follow the surroundings well.
I still don't know that the concept of a smooth place gets its true meaning later.
At the Prague gate, we are encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I'm trying to bet on anyone who's offering a hand, and I'm recommending it to Kata, because ten crushes with fans are like half an energy stick.
It's actually working, we're speeding up again, and as if we're going down a lot, now we're starting a racing ride.
We're running out of dozens of runners, when I'm putting someone in particular tired, I'm trying to encourage him with a few words, "Come on, you're gonna get it!"
No one's ahead of us for the last ceremony, we're speeding up.
So far we've been running for an hour and a quarter, adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the target will be hurt, but it really needs to be done.
The sun has fallen slowly and the day ends symbolically slowly ends the race.
The last exit to the bridge, the tower and just the track to the target.
The pace we're running, I'm surprised where the girl takes it?
"Come on, let's go under 13 hours, let's go!" I call.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a target here.
An hour of thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
The coach set a limit of 20 hours.
So seven minutes under plan.
Which is a great result.
Right behind the goal of Kate's legs, I'm helping her to the back of her bed where she's resting for a while.
She's got to see the exhausting, but also good luck with a well done performance.
After a while, I'll take her out of the target area.
Euphoria doesn't think about the pressure in the passageway to the dress.
It's here to see that Koz's street wasn't the narrowest place.
That's right here for the purpose of a landing, which is under attack of almost ten thousand runners to break.
If anyone doesn't like gifts, it's not a place for him.
And after a while, I'm losing my mind and I'm thinking about whether those beautiful views and past years have become the most interesting route for what's going on in the target.
From my own experience, I know that the competition is not fun.
If ten thousand people are added to this, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire Prague Centre for All Transport, this is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of route showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere released in the Yellow Ladders was transferred between the race and the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the random spectators raised it on every meter of track.
Unfortunately, in the course of the city's historic centre, it has to be counted with obstacles that cannot be removed, but the goal of the mass race in a place that is on one side of the wall and on the other river, I do not consider as the best solution.
If I say that the race is over with the goal, I value it as a very successful one.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but finally everything went well.
Write to us in the discussion if you liked the route and what you're saying about the target situation.
Prisoners in Bulgaria organise protests
Hundreds of prison staff throughout Bulgaria participated in the international protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their requirement to re-establish the original working conditions that had recently changed.
The list of requirements to be discussed with the temporary Minister of Justice, Christo Ivanov, is also higher.
The overseers of the month symbolically protested against the new working time and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the committees of the prison guards and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree to inform the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
"The talks are still taking place," said BNR Director General of Rosen Zhelyazkov Prison Service.
It is also expected that the members of the Federation of Committee of Employees' Organizations in the Ministry of the Interior will join the protests of the prison staff.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we don't see them
The bestsellers usually don't write physics, but Brian Green, at the Columbia University in 1999, a trial was filed in black.
His book The Elegant Universe became the most accessible route for times, how to explore the host of problems that a number of theoretical physicists are dealing with today - trying to unite two great functional but mutually incompatible findings of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the elegant universe is that in search of a unified physical theory, there is no boring story.
The physical fundamental problem between two key theories (because at this point our universe is de facto divided into two different worlds with different laws) has been solved and solved so ideally that it is worth retelling and time.
Greene also advised with the complex material so much fresh and simply that he could not calculate how interesting he had not included in his book.
In addition, he made his "error" from most of the other two books: the structure of the universe and the Hidden Reality.
The author would probably not object to anything if his book was getting older faster, but the fact is that after 15 years, the elegant universe still provides almost everything that the informed time with the world's ambitions should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is relatively likely that in the next few years, there will be only something alive in this area (needed to be the accelerator for LHC to finally go to "full gas"), so it is a good time to enter Green, which is not a violent door to modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound silly, fantastic, strange or mystic.
Yet it is concrete and entirely acceptable.
To understand it, for a moment let us turn our vision away from the universe as a whole to something more underground, specifically to a long and thin gardening curtain.
Imagine that with a hundred meters of garden hadi you pull from one side of the canyon on the other and follow the entire scenario from a half-kilometre distance (as on the picture and on the following page).
From such a distance, you can easily notice a long distance in a horizontal direction, but if you do not suffer bytrospectiveness, you can spread the thickness of the hose.
In view of your great distance from the Hades, you would think that the ant that lived on the Hadica has only one dimension in which you can pass: the left-right dimension along the Hadica.
If anyone asks you where the ant was at the moment, answer him only with one information: the distance of an ant from the left (or right) end of the ant.
All we want to do is say that from a distance of half a kilometer, it looks like a long piece of Hades as a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, there's a shark in it.
If we increase everything, we'll suddenly see the second dimension - in the shape of a circle surrounding the hedge.
In this enlarged view, it is obvious that an ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in a well-known left-to-right dimension after the length of the hadis, but also in "the dimension in/in the direction of the movement of the clock towels", i.e. around the circumference of the hadis.
You start to understand that to determine the position of a small ants you have to enter two numbers: how far is it from the end of the shark and where it is on the circle surrounding the shark.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hadice is two-dimensional (known experts will conclude that this chapter is focused purely on the disorder theory of string.
Chapters 12 and 13 shall apply from time to time).
The hoddice surface is two-dimensional: one long side dimension is represented by a direct arrow, a dimension in the direction of the circle, marked by a circle arrow, is short and porous.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size of the side of the hose is long and easily visible.
The size of the surrounding area of the hadice is short, "swine" and worse known.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the sharks with a much better distinction.
This example illustrates the important property of spatial dimensions.
That they're divided into two groups.
They can be large, wide, and therefore sharp, or rather small, porous, and much more noticeable.
Of course, in that case, we did not just prevent us from revealing the "swine" dimension of the circulatory mass of the Hadide.
It's just taken a long way to help.
But if the hats were thinner - like hair or capillary - we'd only be exposed to the porous dimension with great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he gave a thrilling thought that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three known dimensions to all of us.
Kaluza’s radical claim was based on the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein’s general relativity and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory can be vescat into the only unified concept structure.
The question immediately arises as to how this Kaluz's scene goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer that Kaluza quietly predicted between the lines and which he made clear and clarified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926 stands and falls with the conviction that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and pig-sized dimensions.
This means that, just as the dimension in the direction of the length of the Hades has our universe large, wide and easily visible three dimensions, whose existence we know at any moment.
But analogous to the circular area of the garden has the space and additional dimensions, firmly ground into space so impermeable that even before our most perfect experimental apparatus, there have been hidden.
To get a clearer idea of the basis of Kaluze's remarkable proposal, let's stay at the hedade for a while.
Imagine that we're drawing a black rather dense series of circles on the hedged area.
It still looks like a thin uniform line.
With a far-reaching view now, thanks to the drawing, we're going to discover the porous dimension of the sneezing, so we're going to see the motive of picture 2.
Obviously we see that the surface of the housing is double, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and round.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but in addition to one small circle dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, which is a total of four-space dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
In order to help our imaginations a little bit, let us take note of the illustration on page 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circle dimension.
In the picture, we increase the view of the geometry of the space as we increased the surface of the Hades.
Each following level represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (see them at the fourth level of enlargement) if they are swooped into enough small space; thus we explain that we have not observed them so far.
The fourth network depicts the commonly known "great" dimension, while the circumference of the new, small and porous dimension.
Just like the loops in a densely wrapped blanket, these circles exist in every place of normal sizes - we've only drawn them into the averages on a quarterly network because of our perception.
The background of Figure 4 depicts a commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in ordinary dimensions such as the meters, represented by the side of a small square in the square network.
In each of the following illustrations, we will focus on a small area of the previous picture; we will increase it so that it becomes visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see on a few first-level increases.
However, if we go on our way behind the microscopic properties of the space geometry further - at the fourth level of the increase in the picture 3 - we will suddenly see a new, shape of the circle with a porous dimension similar to the skeletal or densely woven piece of copper.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circle size exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions as well as has a hedged circle circumference at every point of its length.
In the interest of opinion, we have drawn a circle in only a few regularly located points.
Figure 4 The image of Kaluz and Klein on the microscopic structure of the geometry of the space is reduced.
The similarity to the Hadiks is obvious, perhaps we also note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we only drew two), where the hadice has a large size just one.
Even more important is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just about some object inside the universe, like our hadis.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circle-like dimension is extremely miniature, recognize it - as well as the circle circle of the Hades - much more difficult than to observe the clear, large and wide dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact be revealed over the strength of our most modern enlargement tools.
Most importantly, however, the additional dimension is not just a round backbone within normal dimensions, as double-dimensional illustration mistakenly indicates.
The circle dimension is a new dimension, which exists in each point of three normal range dimensions.
It is the size of the remaining three dimensions independent of the same size as the size of the top-down, left-right and front-back independent (and round) each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions and in order to determine its position, we would need four data besides three other common positions in the circle dimension; if we count time, then the data five, in each case, about one more than we would normally expect.
Did you get caught?
Book Elegant Space Brian Greene can be bought here on books.idnes.cz.
The e-book price is 149,- Kč.
To our surprise, then, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzov and Klein's view that this does not exclude the existence of additional pig dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe can have a calmer dimension than we can see with a simple eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can identify the structures of the billions of feet.
We can barely see a small pig dimension.
In 1926 Klein combined the original Kaluz's idea with several thoughts from just parent quantum mechanics.
Its calculations indicated that the additional circle dimension could have the size of about one Planc's length, i.e. the size far from different capabilities of today's devices.
Since then, physics has called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions of Kaluzov-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises how to exercise on electric guitar: 5th part
The whole "twelve" is in a twelve-touch harmonious form, which you can either repeat.
Whoever taps in the music theory will find its principle explained here in detail.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By forming a shovel and a shovel, whose facebook profile can be monitored here, from the age of twenty years ago live as a graphic.
He's a guitarist of the Wahnout chapel, from which unfortunately he can't leave.
Kytaristus is after his father, just like his brother Matthew, the leader of Wohnout.
Start with training on one string.
"The rhythm model is only for you, you can think of anything, then just apply it to the harmonic model twelve," says Honza.
If you add another string, you can swap the figure again.
Just listen and watch Honz, what can be done with twelve harmony on two strings to think about and how well it starts to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can already type some songs with the tunes.
When you finally add the fourth, attention to the change of the ship, the Honza is alerted to the video.
The next time Honza comes back to the pentatonium, you'll try to put her together with the twelve.
Well, then, just keep practicing it.
Best of all, you can read this in the conversation with Jan Homolo at his first class lesson in the electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for the great celebration, it recognizes the castle Hall
We take the point and we like it.
For the first half, we had more chance, the second home," corrected the attacker, who was scored this time from the coup.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, but you just accompanied her with a huge pussy?
Somehow, I didn't notice it, even if on the second branch, where the domestic fans are, it'd probably be worse.
You've settled the penalty in half, but you've also got the goal from the penalty in just four minutes.
What happened?
We slept at the beginning, we were passive, we got out of the corner, and then we got a pendulum.
You got up after her, and the first time you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree with the fact that we've been playing after the incassated goal until the break is good.
In the cabin, we said we wanted to keep the pace of the game, but we couldn't.
To tell the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it's probably also true that the housewives said something about their game, they probably weren't very satisfied with it.
You've only been at the competition's scene for the first time, while you've probably never even got a goal at home.
Why is it such a difference?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, it's more up to us to deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Plzen, it's another category.
You've been waiting for four games, and you're not afraid that it might be the same after the last match?
Not at all, but of course we're glad that we don't have to listen to the previous game about waiting for the goal.
Now we have added more without waiting, but there are still only three in six matches, which is not yet for the great celebration.
Island - the water flows from a mile away.
The lion flying on the surface in the area of Holuhraun near the glacier of Vatnajökul, attracts a underground tunnel from a km away crater.
It is under the ice, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now concerns the most...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.)
2014) continues to fly out of the shell approximately the same quantity of lead.
In contrast to the original estimates, however, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
On the contrary, the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x larger.
However, scientists are concerned that the lava tunnel could be opened even in places where it is below ice.
If this happened, in addition to the similar intensity of the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the river Jökuls at Fjöll, and on the other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption there is strong smell of cheese, the cloud of steam and gas is rising from the trunk.
It is certainly not appropriate for the eruption to be suitable for the tourist movement, as was the case with the eruption in Fimmvardzhals in 2010.
This is much bigger and is also much more gas," says Vulcanologist Armann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved significantly since yesterday, and in the early hours, the area has become almost indistinguishable.
The steps after the sand storm were cleared by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air operations, the orange level (second highest) for Bardardbung and the yellow (third) for Aska is paid.
The sky over Chebe belonged to brave Lady Peggy.
She went by the wings.
A summer day in Chebu.
On the machine Boeing Stearman PT-17 was a Peggy Valentine's acrobat, which came out of the cockpit in the summer to the upper wing of the double wing and also between the wings.
There's only a drop in the force of the muscles.
The summer day in Chebu was already busy and the rowers were able to make some interesting flight pieces again.
The prime minister at the oldest Czech airport was not only "walking by the wings" in the administration of the German acrobatic Peggy Valentino, but also the legendary p-51 D Mustang or Beechcraft flight 18.
He's been paying attention to his brilliant origins.
Acrobat called Wingwalking is the origin of the United States.
After World War I, this was how many former war pilots were tried.
Only because of the large number of fatalities he was banned.
But today he's coming back slowly to the flight day program.
Peggy's going to come out of the cockpit on the top wing after the start.
There's a variety of exercises.
At the end of the show, he moves to space between the wings of the airport, where her show continues," said Luděk Matěiček from the Czech Ultralight Club and the organizer of the day.
The pilot of Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main show, then the next performance of Mustang's strike was a famous piece of cake.
The legendary strike on the ground was taken with the Grippy Army of the Czech Republic in the curtain (so-called numbers).
Such an arrangement could be seen by the flying fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then presented the breath of the acrobatics with the 1945 flight.
He was still made for war, but he probably never took part in it.
He was included in the army reserve.
Since 1963 he has been active in the civil field.
And like a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Minich's Garden.
The same place is also another beechcraft C45H Expedient of the Czech Air Day, two-engine Beechcraft C45H.
He didn't go to the airport to check on the machine.
His depleted bloodstream has gone far away.
He also won the Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard machine in the colors of the French aircraft.
A small passenger plane jumped for Turbolet and brought a part of the German delegation to the airport on the day of flight from Germany.
The German neighbour of Chebu was introduced with reconstructed aircraft as 18T or a triangular formation of Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return to camera!
Family care has replaced Lucie Borhy at least for tonight's work.
Stress or nervousness - blonde moderator obviously doesn't know any of this.
Modern television news was good for her, as if she had not stopped with her for two months!
It's only two weeks before the blondes end on the six-week period in which women experience the greatest stress after birth.
Lucie, however, will not show herself regularly in TV Nova's main news report.
Regular return is due according to information from Blesk.cz to month.
But only her daughter Linda now needs more than television viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a black hole.
Shows for a year in Prague?
Hala's gonna be sold out. She's planning a Jagr wedding.
It would be honorable if something like this had been done during the world's championship.
But it matters how the bond is made," said in Jihlava after the exhibition with the title of the Golden Race, in which the charming Nagan team met again.
And the players who shared in the gold hat.
The players should like it, right?
Sure.
It would be good to make a short farewell to the golden generation during the championship.
I think they're allowed to find one two days during the tournament, when it's completely free and where it's possible to interfere with such a strike.
Let's say it to Gum (Jiřim Šlégrovi) or to Bědě Šcherban (the leader of the Yugoslav War), who would take care of it...
The arena would be sold out.
What if you're playing with New Jersey play-off?
So when I fly...
You don't want to play in the performance.
Or has the July meeting changed your decision?
Representations and exhibits are two different things and the performance is decisive in the representation.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but performances are decisive, especially for the world's championship.
There should be players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed in any way.
How did you actually enjoy the Naganian search?
It was just a great meeting with the players.
A man has lived his stories and has had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was Ivan Hlink's honor.
And it's good to remind you of the history of our hockey and that there's a generation that's really behind it.
Slavomir Lener, Vladimir Rožička and Petr Čechmánek at the center.
Do you still have your first performance match?
She doesn't forget about such things.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young men: me, Robert Holík, and Robert Reichel, we were in one three.
For all of them, it was the first representative start.
But if we were to dominate in some way, that's not what we can say.
In Jihlava, Dominik Hasek was hunted for a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
Hasan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to bring it back to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hasek criticized Jagra for the reasons he decided to end his representation).
And the Hnilikka has a great show.
At the time, he was with me once in the night, and there was a hole.
And now he's caught famous.
First of all, the USA and then the Netherlands, footballers are getting qualified.
On Monday morning, prominent guests went to the NH Hotel.
People could pay tribute to the white Peter Chech of Chelsea, the representative coach Paul Vrbu...
And over there, that black bitch, that's Tomáš Rosick!
The prisoner of Arsenal and the captain of the representation arrived at a meeting of about twelve of the last.
A beautiful match against the Netherlands awaits us.
Who wouldn't like it?" he said when he was already presenting the press at the representative's meeting.
Czech Republic
Monday 1 September: start of the strike, first training
Tuesday 2 September: Training open for fans (18:30, Summer) Autogramiada (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday September 9th Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of strike
Russian and sex fans can support even before the U.S. mid-war (20:15).
The representation for them opened the Tuesday train, which starts at the Summer at 18:30.
And then he'll follow the autographs that the Russians and the Czechs will not miss.
Otherwise, this meeting of the national team will be calmer.
Which is to be commended by the coach Vrba, who has just complained about the amount of social action in the spring.
Finally, we will devote ourselves to what we want to commit.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage if you have players together for eight days.
We're going to have time to practice things that haven't been so long," praised the Vorba, who officially runs the national team since January.
The Czech football representative will carry out a Musketeer's image at the entrance to the new qualification cycle.
There are three matches under the Vrbau, all ready.
With Norway and Finland resigned 2:2 and with Austria losing 1:2.
However, these results have not yet been important.
That's it now.
In contrast with the Netherlands, the qualifications for the 2016 European Championships are being launched.
Of course, it would help the Czech man if he also managed the General against the United States.
The first half was to meet us.
Now there are important results.
We need to think about being successful," Vrba said.
The only player who has a three-and-a-half-year appointment with health problems is the attacker David Lafata.
He's suffering from fever.
If he couldn't cure himself for the U.S. Central Attack, coach Vrba would have called another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often poorly diagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how she felt after a bad diagnosis for many years that she was dying.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage years thinking she was only a few years away.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves beyond the brain and the five.
The CMT UK charitative organization stated that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, as it is only very little known about disease.
It is considered that in the United Kingdom, about 23,000 people suffer from CMT, which may show symptoms in the field of motors such as muscle weakness, unstable steps and broken fingers on their feet.
In the affected, there may also be inadvertentness or pain, this condition is irreparable and progressive, which means that symptoms get worse over time.
When it was Rodgers' thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Frederice's ataxia (FA) -- a disease that has a very bad forecast.
She believed that before she celebrated the eighteenth birthday, she would be supported by a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I could not do the same things as the others.
I fell down every day and it all lasted longer.
I've never been able to ride with the other kids on dolls or skateboards, and at school, I was shocked by how I walked and ran."
When it was Rodgers' thirteen and it was after several operations that they were supposed to release her Achilles' feet and fix her feet, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room, and looked at her documentation, where she found out she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was following, and so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I returned home, I searched for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the Association FA,” he says.
When they answered, I was in shock, I was just panicking.
I thought before I was eighteen, I'd end up on the truck, and before I was fifty, I'd be dead, and in the meantime I'd lose all my abilities.
I was all alone on it, and I was planning a funeral."
When she was 17 years old, she realized that her ability to walk did not deteriorate as much as she expected, and she asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said: “Daughter, I don’t think you have a disease, or you’d be on a vehicle.
I think it's going to be something much less dangerous."
After graduating several genetic tests it was found to have CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT is, I thought I was a happy child," she said.
The CMT UK charitative organization began a month of information about CMT in order to warn of this disease.
Entrepreneurship in Washington: Tax is taxed
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And also higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, the state and local tax of companies in the country with rapid recovery of the economy increased slightly last year and the companies in Washington were no exception.
The entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia, together for the fiscal year 2013, contributed $27.6 billion to public and local savings, which is 3.8% higher than the amount of 26.6 billion selected in 2012.
The tax burden - both public and local - increased by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and was the third year of growth after 2009 and 2010 when tax was reduced.
According to the study carried out by the professional company Ernst & Young and the political collection Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster by 4.3% than local deductions by 3.9%.
More than half of the county's income, 56%, is from the income tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from the company.
Virginia, with 28 %, shows the relatively minimum corporate tax revenue.
Researchers claim that the majority of the tax revenue growth is due to an increase in the value of real estate to companies, which has increased by 3.7 % after the coming three years of real estate tax.
Although most of the profits come from large states like California, New York and Texas, it seems the same situation is in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Vriginia paid more than $10 billion in public and local property taxes last year, which represents an annual increase of 4.2% compared to 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, there is a clear increase in the value of real estate, which is not so much of the public and local tax revenue in Maryland, where real estate tax represents a total of five corporate taxes.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the property tax represents almost half of the state and local tax.
“In Maryland, it owns a lot of real estate, especially the base of taxes around D.C., government or non-profit organization that does not pay taxes,” explained Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on, for example, income tax to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
The recent increase in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed only to the healing market with properties.
According to the data, revenue from the business also appears to increase.
Companies in this region have published taxes on the income of business companies of $2.3 billion, which have increased from 2.1 billion since 2012.
Maryland has selected one billion dollars in income from commercial companies, most in the region.
Although the same direction is taken, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs does not increase in these three places as quickly as possible.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the level of the national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was an increase of 4,1 % on average.
Virginia has from all three districts (which all have the same tax) the lowest tax on the income of commercial companies, 6 %.
The rate of tax on Maryland's companies is 8.25 %, while the D.C. average remains relatively high at 9,975 %.
A similar study carried out this year by the American Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower government and local taxes and a generally more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. study has not been evaluated.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed a tax reduction law from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax is reduced to 5%.
If income targets continue to be met in the coming year, the rate of income tax fixed by law in 2017 could be reduced to 3 %.
According to a recent study with small businesses in Washington, higher government and local taxes are being paid.
The life tax levied by small businesses as a personal income tax - the structure of compensation for higher prices, according to which most companies are organised - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia increased by 20% last year to 2.4 billion dollars, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers claim that the trend and the national increase in food tax will likely continue next year, the overall revenue from sales for government and local governments will increase by 6.2% in comparison to the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014.
However, Washington may remain behind others because lowering public expenditure is choosing its tax on the labour market.
What escaped you: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorovusko and Lafat's knives
Is it going to be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for a discussion on Novorusku
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the south-east of Ukraine, where government units with the Peruvian rebels have been fighting since April.
He also warned European companies that, following the current regime of anti-Russia sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
Support provided to the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine, according to which it resists democratic values.
He thinks the end of the conflict depends on Kyev, so he can't say when the Ukrainian crisis ends.
Any more sanctions for Russia?
Czech Republic has had the right to disagree with parts
The European Commission, together with diplomats, has to propose a form of further anti-Russia sanctions, decided to present the EU summit tonight.
The president told reporters of the meeting of Herman Van Rompuy's Member States.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, specific proposals for the release of sanctions are to be made on Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuye returns in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Union's summit at the head of the European Council, that is, the so-called EU President, who manages the summits of the Member States.
From December to two and a half years, Herman Van Rompuye will be replaced.
In front of European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton's Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogherinová is appointed.
Italy, which will thus become the Vice-President of the future European Commission, still needs to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
The assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, it's just not about it.
Helping an incurable and long-term patient with a life-threatening leave?
In Czech terms, where the laws do not allow euthanasia, it is not legally applicable.
However, the statements of the doctors who spoke to LN indicate that they are hearing such requests.
ALS: The hardest chapter of neurology, says the doctor about sclerosis

But if we don't try, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a motor neurologist.
There's a CIA manuscript, they needed a war, writes Huml about shooting the MH17 flight.
The envoy for ČSSD Stanislav Huml has clearly in mind who shot the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is obvious that "the harsh sanctions that were declared in view of the shooting of a civilian aircraft with almost 300 dead were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army".
According to the law firm, it's also known the CIA's manuscript.
Unfulfilled promises.
The elections are near and the parties offer the impossible again
End of homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and lunch over Prague.
It is repeated before every election: the parties promise impossible.
Now, too, with the upcoming municipal elections, politicians are being pushed forward, who likes the people more.
The Lidovky.cz server has chosen ineligible promises from the present and the past.

Her commander Alois Liška has consistently requested the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
Finally, the British side declared and organized this Earth unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German forces.
SOUHRN: Plzeň leads the league before the Prague "S", Liberec declassified Baník
Victoria Plzeň is the new leader of the football league, leading to a point in front of both Prague's "S".
Changes in the table led to a defeat of glory 1:2 in Mladé Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta was remembered in the house - to - house league, with two Lafat's attacks defeating Jablonec.
The record victory in the year was recorded by Liberec, who shot Baník Ostrava 6:0.
62 thousand spectators on the volleyballs?
The Poles say yes.
The launch of MS volleyballists in Warsaw brought a visual record.
At the football stadium under the covered roof, there was a smooth victory of over 62 thousand spectators over Serbia.

Family Joan Rivers: "We hold hands"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was taken to the hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today that she is not losing the hope of an 18-year-old comedian being healed.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," Melissa Riversová said in today's statement.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the rescue service, according to which she found a hearty foundation at the Yorkville Endoscope in Upper East Side, as the source stated.
Doctors deliberately maintain it under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision, until they are sure of its status, which remains “serious”.
The reactions did not allow them to wait a long time, including ineffective online support from personalities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is cross-titles
That the media, by their titles, violates reality, there is no news.
I know that the headlines "sold" the newspaper, but unfortunately, I also know that there are many so-called "readers", who don't read anything else.
And that's the fact that I've had a lot of trouble lately, the tougher the word is.
This concerns, in particular, articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The titles "Israel Attacked Gaza" are quite common.
Just read in the text that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the fire rockets from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the reported incident.
Then the title "Both parties broke the line" appears.
Does the press community realise that this process is directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not just there)?
It hasn't even lasted 60 years since the end of World War II.
So far, there are people who have survived Shaw.
When I saw a video from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd was shouting out the words "Jewish pigs" and similar superstitions, I was shocked.
Is this what the world wants to finish what didn't happen to Hitler?
Are our journalists aware that after the Jews they were destined to eliminate the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen, please pay a little more attention to your work.
You've often been marked as "a watchdog for democracy."
So defend her.
As long as he's here.
Also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if any of our neighbours decided that the Czech nation would be eliminated and the Czech Republic removed from the world map?
Maybe you should also realize one more fact.
Nearly 20% of the Arab population live in the territory of the state of Israel.
And they're good there.
If you ask them why they don't go between their own, maybe to Gaza, they'll answer you why would they do that?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and health care (I have seen in my own eyes, as well as in the home hospital of Hadassa, which is funded from the sponsorial donations of Jews from all over the world, usually also the Arabs and are, of course, treated there).
Hamas is also attacking his Arab brothers with his shootings.
The only real help from Gaza, and this restless area, is to rescue Hamas and arm him.
And not judge Israel, lest it be in the midst of them that are called by the name of the LORD.
Inform Hamas about his practices, his abuse of people as human shields.
Report that Hamas is intended to eliminate the state of Israel at any cost.
Even for the death of innocent Arab children.
Report that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Report that in nine years the Gaza Strip could have been this area of humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity, which the Gazi administrators do not pay for, and they are even disappointed that the supply of electricity is interrupted at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that they could be persecuted by suicide attackers in the territory of Israel, but the construction of homes, hospitals and schools would have been much better for his Arab brothers from Gaza.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion for Twitch
AMAZON just confirmed claims Monday morning information: Internet retailer - producer of videos and hundreds of other things - buys for $1.04 billion (970 million) video streaming service Twitch.
The announcement was a surprise, not because no one would expect Twitch to buy, but because it was expected that the buyer would be YouTube.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitche Google seemed to be one billion secure, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which just three years ago founded Justin.tv, had been blinded to become a commonly used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who sent online transfers from the game - the words Business Insider "YouTube for live-transmitted games".
Interaface Twitche.
On YouTube there are already popular "Let's play" videos, a species where wise people (most elders) are playing mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube when describingTwitch comes across a lot of things, so the news that YouTube is buyingTwitch, who didn't really cancel out, was a student example of how the company in question pays for possible competition.
Zahadou is why the agreement with YouTube did not come out, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at present is the CEO Twitche Emmet Sheara's statement: "We chose Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us fulfill it faster."
Another mystery is -- honestly -- the incredible success of Twitche.
For snobs like me, who claim that sport is preferable to watching, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about it, games instead of real play just to watch.
One thing is to look at a friend in the morning over his shoulder, as resident Evil plays, and the other thing is to see someone else get 20 shots in the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that many of today's, most popular games are from players' perspectives, so looking at their record, without being able to control your own perspective, is a pretty good recipe for how to sort out the moles.
I admit that games like speed run, in which Rogers Bannists our electronic times finish the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone is not a master of play or humor, his channel on Twitchi will probably not be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch has a monthly visit of 55 million and is fourth at the top of internet traffic.
How exactly does the Amazon use it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch blends into the Amazon Instant Video as elegant as it could have been on YouTube.
But Twitch has something that she would like to attract every company: the hordes of young men who want the inserts.
As director Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch "believes in the future game" and the media don't seem to have a good time, even as - sex - fans.
The second fundamental lie to creationism.
Another Czech translation of American atheistic blogger Aaron Ra.
This time on the theme "Holy Letters Are God's Word."
Original video added.
The second basic lie to creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that are contrary to their religion, they often ask us, Who will you believe?
A proud word of God, or a man's word?
It was as if human examinations were completely ineffective compared to the authority they assumed to have their doctrine.
Only when they say "man," they're talking about knowledge.
And when they refer to "the word of God", they refer to myths of the people who are recorded.
If there really exists intelligent with the creator for some purpose, then it is he who created a fossil record that reveals evolutional history, and it must be he who invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be he who added another series of evidence that shows exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion of the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people will get to tell stories, fabulate.
And it was people who wrote all the texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposed holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as the people who are buried, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictation of angels, but these texts were not written by any other than mere mortals with certain peace of imagination, not angels and no gods at all.
If there really was one true God, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, super-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the whole space.
If a person of such size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only holy letter.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without precedents, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors could not measure themselves with such a work.
And people would not have to believe it blindly because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and it would reveal deep antagonism and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would inspire every reader to join the common faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't have expected anything smaller.
It's just what we see instead of it, it's a very different thing.
Instead of the only religion that leads to ultimate truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and all of them continue to divide into more and more distinct denominations, searching for conflicting truths, and in every way calling on God’s guidance, regardless of the continuing disunity and division in every direction.
Jewish Torah, Christian Gospel, Islamic Koran, Bahá'u'lláhov Kitab-i-Akdás, Zarathustrovy Avesty, Sikh Adi-Granth, Mahabharátsk Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Book of Urantia are all regarded as "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the only true God" and the relevant believers say to each of them that these others are in happiness.
The only logical explanation is likely to be to some extent all of them.
None of the above-mentioned books have any other advantages.
None of them have any evidence and none of them can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the West Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologism (obhajobs), because they contain inequalities, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So he can't claim to be evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote the ferocious beasts rather than the ant, and many of them claim to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of the prophecy - by the fact that everyone can also contain the prophecy that was not fulfilled.
The former theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and thus are the subject of interpretations, perceptions and views of their primitives and often preconceived politically motivated authors, which explain many of the contradictions and inequalities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, rather a mutual comment.
We have to point out again that we have two different authors here whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial audit.
It's true that Genesis has more than one author, and he's definitely not telling an eye witness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for Pentateuch, i.e. five books of "Moses" and Moses do not subscribe to authority any of them, because it was almost certainly not the way it was described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezdraša) of several mutually inappropriate oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
Other documents have been re-filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as those who believe it.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic faiths, yet they are much younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed the teachings and ebony and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a compromise called orthodox.
Other Christian groups, such as the Luciferians, were distinguished and distinguished by other Bible revisions.
One of these rules applies to King Ugarit, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a fundamental threat to young Mossian religions, the authors of the New Law decided to smile and Ba'al Zebula, "Lord of the Mountain" changed to Belzebub "Lord of the Sea".
So the Bible was deliberately and subjugated for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the New Law was canonized in the fourth century B.C.E. in a series of Commission decisions on snow in Nika.
Four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by a simple lifting of hands, as if the reality of some things were accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon developed depends on what was read in the weeks in the Christian centers of that day.
What was read on the second Sunday after the grandeurs in Jerusalem’s church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually they found that he was drawing close to the same Gospel accounts.
And so the cannon core developed from the corner of the original church.
So the council just accepted as the gospel any relevant stories that surrounded unconcerned masses at the time.
Still, they wisely accepted more than ten books from the Bible, even though they referred to them as books that were approved.
Among the rejected items are the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer to books that are just words of some people and/or are not available anymore?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could she be so approved if God were the real author of this random mix of stories, similarities, and mourning lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by people and certainly not by too much enlightenment, rather by the contrary!
That's why so much of its historical and scientific content is completely wrong, whether it's almost anything from the beginning to the end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and asses could speak, believed in the gleaming, bloody victims, ritual magic, enchanted objects, firelights, astrology and five lives of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic wire that they used to suck someone's blood, it would cure him from the plague.
We're talking about people who thought the queens were survivors and the bats are birds and whales are fish and drink that's the whole number.
These people believed that if they showed the pregnant cow through the pattern, they would give birth to the hare.
How could anyone say this, who knows anything about genetics?
The authors of this book, of course, didn't know.
If the Bible were written in a higher form, it would not contain the errors it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior creature and was thought to be a literal history, then it would not contain anything of what it contains.
As a moral guide totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by unrecognised and bigot savages who looked over or supported cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, abuse of family members, abuse of children, abuse of children, loss, rape, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To defend their indecisiveness by claiming to do God’s will.
But the creationists still ignore all this.
Some of their websites admit that if there is any truth in conflict with the Bible, then the truth must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a God.
In their world there is one and the other the same.
It's ironic that they reject God's "work" as "obligation of creation rather than the Creator".
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and of the God of themselves, and they even insist that the revelation of their supposed "holy" books is some kind of eviction of God as such.
Not their version of God, but all the versions of God.
Creative Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and that the Bible could at the same time be mistaken, for it cannot separate the doctrine from God.
So it's kind of a pattern where believers worship a man-made compilation, as if these books were God alone, because they think they are Jehovah's word.
Only God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or refused to accept into their supposed "unchangeable word" of any god has been invented, constructed, grouped, translated, interpreted, corrected, and often also deliberately changed and crossed by only the wrong people.

An attacker at the Chinese school beat nine people, three of them died
A man named Čchen, according to New China's agency, entered the building of the primary school this morning and attacked around eleven local times.
Three of the nine people who were stabbed died later in the hospital.
The Czech Republic later killed himself with a high jump, introduced New China with a link to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public therefore calls for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where there are many married couples in accordance with government policy only one offspring.
Zeman showed his cousins in Láne how he had to sit in school
The youngest schoolchildren took the nine to their class, where they were waiting for the president's arrival with her teacher.
Then he showed the kids how he had to sit alone at school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind your back, it's not waiting for you anymore, you're free people," Zeman told the children.

Minister of Education Marcel Chládek started a new school year in private sports school in Lithuania.
"This year I want to connect more Czech school with Czech sport," one of the reasons why the first school day was released in northern Czech.
The school's leadership spoke to him on a hockey strike in Lithuania a long time ago.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to participate in the start of the school year," the minister added.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started school year in private sports school in Lithuania.
In the first class of the year, there were 115 thousand firstlings.
The primary school will be conducted in total over 850 thousand children and over 405 thousand students will be educated in secondary schools, the Ministry of Education estimates.
The new art director of the news is David Fiala
From September 1st, David Fiala became the new art director of news and television advertising.
As a function, Alan Zarub, who has led the creation department of the entire Nova group since June 1.

David Fiala controls very well the synergy of communication between editors, studio management and the graphic department, which is the basis of the work of the art director of the reporting.
He has a quote for typography and clean elegant design, which is the way we want to go in the news video to pick up," says creative director Novy Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly subjected to hackers, got our images famous to the public
Picture of the screen with the output of unique files
So far, anonymous user on server 4chan publishes naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, alerted American server Machable.com.
Apparently, he obtained invalid access to user accounts on Apple servers, where the user's injuries were recorded through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple hasn't come up with a problem yet.
Part of the celebrity rejects images as falsified, but several of the affected images have already been admitted.
Among them is an actress Jennifer Lawrence known as Katniss in the film series Hunger Games or Mary Elizabeth Winsteadová, who played for example in the Death trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the images and videos obtained to enrich.
The footage reportedly showed interest in American magazines, according to reports on server 4chan but wants hacker better money from the community.
According to The Next Web, it is very likely that there is a weakness in iCloud security.
On the GitHub server, a tool was found two days ago, which enabled you to get passwords for user accounts by using a rough force, i.e. by automatically repeating attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool was obviously working, but Apple closed the security door after two days.
However, it is true that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to different accounts prior to the publication of this instrument.
iCloud users should therefore change their password associated with Apple ID for preventive reasons.
The length of the password, not its complexity, is important.
The length is at least 12 characters.
The absence of naked images should be considered as a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers are companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft, provided much better than computers in households or smaller companies, uploading sensitive photos in unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to store on-line explicit photos or any other sensitive content, first encrypt files before uploading.
It is also reasonable to set automatic storage of photos from the phone so that it only takes place on the wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
Then you will be able to move sensitive images "to security", and above all you will have space to remove unclaimed images, so they will not necessarily take space in the online store.
How to encrypt files and communications on the Internet, we offer HN and IHNED.cz readers in the form of an electronic book from Michal Altaira Valáška in PDF format.
A smart way to save for high school scripts
Since the price for a high school script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the current second year student came with a smart way to reduce costs.
He invented a system of borrowing books from colleagues from seniors with the offer of nominal compensation to keep them sold back.
"The book on calculations, which is usually worth 180 dollars, I won in the semester for ten and for chicken nuggets," says Schroeder, 19, who studies at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would be $430, he says.
I lost 120.
According to the University Council, the average student loses more than $1,200 a year for pupils and assistants, but students have different opportunities to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students is online shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
On the rise is the borrowing of students, which enables students to use the book semester and often with a significant discount before they buy it.
Or Inc, operating more than 250 bookstores in campus areas, says that the lending of books has doubled since 2011.
Research in the industry shows that around a quarter of the books in university books were borrowed in the last spring semester, Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer says.
Less than half of the teaching texts are purchased by the National Association of University Trades in University Bookstores.
Here's 101 best ways to sleep.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler is nearly $290, but on the Internet it is possible to purchase a new $239.99 at Chegg.com, a retail store specializing in the classroom.
Buy Used
If you do not mind the comments of other people or the consumption and destruction, appropriate learning texts are used.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says that at Amazon.com, he paid for the printed "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" 42 cents.
The new guy was selling for $48.
Ingrid Bracey University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls suggests that students in their students verify that older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes there are no significant changes to the work at the seminars.
If so, the oldest editions can be sold for a fraction of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay's Half.com is the preferred alternative to buying used books.
Loans
It is also worth considering loaning students if you do well with them, you do not forget to return them and you do not need to have them even after the seminar is over.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of the new book.
For example, the student could borrow "Calculus" for about $20 a semester.
List the terms and conditions of the transaction in which you borrow the book, including the extent to which you notice, stress or consumption and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the discount may be higher than the price of a new book.
E-shirt
Another option is to check out the normal e-book instead.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid after a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows "Calculus" for six months for about 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, the best offers can be found by students of literary courses because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go after the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who is soon to arrive at Pepperdine Law School, recommends driving according to the ISBN, because it guarantees that you buy the right book.
Before ordering your book over the Internet, make sure it's really stored, Gault advises.
He's convinced himself of it on his own.
The book he bought was sold for four weeks and had to pay the full price for a book from the university bookstore.
That's bad, that's bad.
And then they found in the cold gun tower at the end of the war.
This barn is a piece from St. Jir's church.
We discovered the growth around and we started to pull out the flying gear - about a meter and a half of the mud and a broken leaf.
As we got close to the middle of the day, we hit the head," said Radomil Novak.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up and found it was a tortoise of German rifles used by SS units.
The finding is probably unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Novak added.
All the wooden construction stuffs have spread over time, so it's useless.
Her body, however, is preserved - keeps its shape.
How's the cold feeling?
There's one explanation.
Maybe she was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by SS units, probably from fear of being removed.
The Fascists would probably not do that.
They threw weapons in the woods," he thinks.
The gun was the only thing that the fans of the Move of the Spirit of the Jessenics found in the barn.
"There could have been hand grenades, those that had been around a lot, so we slowed down the mining work, we carefully examined the mud so that there was no accident, but nothing else was down there," Novak approached.
Nalez will end up in the museum's warehouse in the nearby Slezky Rudoltics.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet been released from prison in the Czech Republic
Exclusive conversation Currently.cz with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of the prorussian separatists.
Kyev/Praha - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... they're calling me from Doneeck," he apologized eight times during the exclusive conversation with Aktualný.cz Ukrainian Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, or also the director of the Dark Centre for the Liberation of War Entrepreneurs.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban on television.
At every such interruption, it was not possible to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they were - or should be - that Ruban is explaining with his opponent at the other end of the phone.
"That'll be it--go there," said one of the lightning discussions with Doneck and again dedicated himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in the reserve, a pilot of fighters and an active participant in anti-government protests in Mayan.
Yesterday, when we had a conversation, he was in Doneck.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of the Peruvian separatists shall be four-and-a-half hours a day.
Currently.cz: You may know that on the part of the Peruvian separatists, the Czechs are also fighting.
Our controversy estimates their number to thirty.
It can be a lot more, though.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I've already freed captured Serbs, Dagestians, Chechens, one Swedish, Georgians... but Czechs have not yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we hit on your private landscape and could free him.
Ukrainian soldier engaged in separatists
A.cz: What advice do you give to the Czechs who join the Persian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers to take care of them?
They should understand that if, as the Czechs fight in Ukrainian volunteers' flags and separatists, they will be shot without mercy, just like any other stranger.
The separatists consider these men to be the tenants, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers occupy a group of Donetsk separatists - and so must the Czechs - they will sit behind the net and deal with him as a military prisoner.
That guy's gonna survive soon.
The Ukrainian side is also acting in war as a state.
A.cz: How many of you have been able to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand that well, they'll exchange it.
Some sources suggest that a hundred men have already exceeded it.
We've long stopped counting how many people we helped.
But we just freed them... we didn't save them from war if they decided to continue in battle.
The rescuers are in the war doctors, surgeons, but we definitely don't.
That's it.
And every day there's another and another.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, another four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to let the prisoners go, and it's just a human request.
A.cz: It is a matter of asking that in a few months, you have gained a great authority and even trust among the prorussian separatists... as well as in the Ukrainian society.
How did you build respect for both sides of the war?
It's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kyjev gave me the nickname "the crazy general with steel balls".
It doesn't bother me.
And maybe that's the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Republican Congregation, I've had some authority before.
I never run, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I act honestly and tell the truth.
Even when it's the Ukrainian government, or the done or Luhansk very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them they're torture and killing.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even when I'm exchanged by the prisoners and they eat... this job for me can ever mean the end... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many corrections and torture do you know about prisoners?
... (long puzzle) to torture prisoners, the Ukrainians and the separatists are defeated during interrogations.
I'm sorry.
What about the repairs?
They're only playing on the Donetian side.
The fact that the Ukrainian army is also repairing the prisoners, I have no information.
No indication that the Ukrainian army will allow for something like that.
We have an idea about the amount of repairs, but I can't give the numbers, and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe the characters and motives of the Peruvian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are trying for independence and perhaps democracy in Doneck or Luhansk - at least they say so.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists already have oligars full of teeth and are their inexcusable resistance to life and death.
As we say, they've moved to the back of their throat.
The same dreams and charges were made by people on the other side of the Mayan.
And now I'm wondering a little bit: Russia supports separatists and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be a big one and the other opposite to a small one.
My sentence is already hiding an unresolved dispute in it.
A.cz: For example, how do you see one of the strongest leaders of the Peruvian separatists Igor Besler?
Whenever I cross the line of war fronts, I'm unarmed and show soldiers or armed men my bare hands.
And I'm always on both sides of those two hundred or three hundred meters on a man or in an optical focuser.
The faces of the people who are looking at me, every good thing I see... and they can always push their weapons off.
High priest, experienced Colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small government in a great Russian empire.
In any case, he keeps talking about it, and Ukraine considers it to be a lack of understanding.
Such a state should not even exist, according to him.
At the same time, he is an invincible enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: When we talk about the characters - in a discussion show on Ukrainian television, your Prime Minister Arsenia Jaceňuk has identified himself as a weak, helpless and tired "leader", who would do the best if he left quickly.
I'll always get at least five fears in the three hundred meters.
So why should I hide in the opinion that Jacenuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is damaging our country?
A.cz: Do you think it's part of the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians call Jacenuk "the queen."
And the king is not in the eyes of the Ukrainians an animal, from which fear would go or should be with other respect and authority.
His behavior directly copies the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister in the war he has no right to cry in parliament, ask him to play with him his intrigues, to threaten that he puts the function... he must govern the country, manage it and at the time of war and protect it.
When threatened by the country, the prime minister has no claim to family, friends, rest on payable emotions.
He's the first of Ukraine's ministers.
What about Jaceňuk?
She's acting like a puberty girl.
Yeah, he's tired, but he's also weak, because he's never been strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the galaxy couldn't save the markets
Extraordinary 3 Sylvester Stalin returned from the $12 million budget in the United States less than $30 million and Son City: Women, for which I would have been killed, returned from the $17 million budget only 12 million.
The movie Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz made only $14.6 million during the first weekend and also movies for children like how to train dragon 2 were for film disappointment.
According to Robbie Collina's film critic in Telegraph, children's films are of their own quality.
Collins marked 2014 as the " worst" year of children's films and how to train dragon 2 called only "functional" continuation.
When it comes to the films that are put on a little older target group, it seems that the problem doesn't necessarily have to be in the quality of the films itself.
In July, he compared Entertainment Weekly servers CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average annual movie premieres broadcast in at least 2,000 cinemas between the Day of War and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of viewers and film critics indicate that this year's film yield is similar to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, there may be a change in access to viewers and a higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's work on the Jungle Book, said the Hollywood Reporter's website, "I think times are changing."
We have to let it go and not try to chase ourselves after what's already happened.
Unlike the current crisis of Hollywood cash markets, Netflix has won $1.2 billion thanks to Internet services, almost twice as much as the last $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised the study for too much reliance on the right to comics, and predicted "the collapse" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current disaster, some commentators say that there may be something on his catastrophic knowledge.
With the introduction of possible large cash markets in summer 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimonów and Jurský world, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
The producer X-Men Simon Kinberg recently marked a decline in the markets for a simple "cyclical". For Hollywood Reporter, he said: "The next summer will be the summer of the biggest cash markets in history and no one will worry about the sale."
KLDR again threatens Soul, fires another short-run rocket
North Korea fired another short-run rocket into the sea, Soul announced.
The flagship missile test took place shortly after the end of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pchjongang considered as preparation for the invasion.
Chagang Province lies on the north-west of KDLR at borders with China.
According to the DPA, the Yugoslav Ministry of Defence spokesperson stated that the shots were fired from the site in the north-west of the KLDR and flew about 200 kilometres away.
So North Korea was probably the first to fire a rocket from the province of Čagang, a South Korean media with a call for military rounds.
In the province there is a subterranean firefighting ramp for Squad-type missiles.
This is another series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has carried out in recent weeks.
North Korea has carried out an unusually large number of rocket and missile tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, protests were held by NATO's opposition summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered at the center of Newport to attend the march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people attended a meeting at Cardiff's workshop, which was described as counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough was watching the situation during the weekend and talking to protestors who came from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be transported by air from the Blue Mountains
Two young tourists were picked up by the plane and transferred to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
Sixteen-year-old girl and eighteen-year-old man went on a trip to Govets Leaf in Blackheath on Sunday afternoon.
When they didn't come home, the family's anxiety called at eight o'clock the night of the police.
She was sent to the fourth reading, including the local police and the rescue team, and a couple of eleven hours of the night was found near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl broke her knee, and the man fell down and fell in the head.
The police stayed with them overnight, and they were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stabilised state, they were transported by a health care unit to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
The breaker brought only a point from Opava, he had a victory on his leg.
The 23-year-old forvard could decide, but he didn't make it in two of the biggest chances.
After the goal, she called for a main shot about three minutes before the end, but she ended up in the network on the market of Opavy Josef Květonová.
I had it on my feet, I have to give it a chance.
I'm mad at myself," your ass fell asleep on his head.
"I guess I should've given it up under the veil, it kind of sucked on me," he said.
The defensive Sigmy did not allow the Pope much, except for Mikul's 11-minute drive, which covered the Golman Reichl.
Then they started pressing Hanáci, but they didn't leave in the block of the protectoring house and shot away the flower.
We compared fifteen minutes, and then we took the initiative.
In the second half, we were better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from the standard situations.
But the opportunity presented did not change, and so it ended 0:0," hated coach Hanák Leoš Kalvod.
The score was also taken for absences in an assembly where, besides two injured persons, Petr Vavřík was missing with a three-goal shooter Petr Ševčík, who are hosting from Sigma in Slezska.
It was not possible for them, unlike their previous policy.
The alternates deserve an absolute.
Sigma acted more football, but until we left her to nothing on one standard," Slezanów coach Petr Baránek said.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression, and fighting.
Remiza is probably worthy, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma got a remix on four points, which means the thirteenth place.
Nothing that could satisfy the leader of Joseph Lebra's club, who, after defeating Znojmem, made his millions contribution to the rich diametrically different performances in other matches.
"We realized Mr. Lebra's warning, so it can't be said that the boys would not want to fight," Calvoda noticed and added to the address of the sleeping shooter, "I believe it's coming and when it hits, it's going to fall there.
But after the first blow, I'm gonna set him up to watch the balls for other matches," Kalvoda said.
Al Pacino hit Benátky twice.
The film festival otherwise survives the crisis
After a great enthusiasm for Birdman's opening film, whose director Alejandro González Inárritus arranged the race among the serious candidates in the Golden Lion, the next days suggested that the interest of the 71st year festival in Benátká was somewhat waded.
Whether the number of seats in the largest hall has increased to fourteen, or because Birdman's criticisms have been followed, but for viewers less attractive images as a document of genocide in Indonesia 60 years ago The view of silence and other films with social theme from the American 99 homes after the Iranian tale, in cinemas short remained empty seats.
Comics of the species Gallus domesticus, not elsewhere specified or included
Even a red blanket in front of the festival palace has not yet covered such gifts as in the past and has apparently ceased to be the problem of finding a place in the hotel at the last minute.
The crisis in Italy is spoken more than elsewhere, and it is not surprising that it has reached as many institutions as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Unfortunately, the crisis does not show a lack of personality, but present only in relation to films.
While the younger fans were looking for autographs of comic superheroes by Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who were successful in 99 homes, all generations became the main event of the legendary actor Al Pacina.
He's locked up in two movies right now.
In the story of the Explanation given outside the competition, which filmed Oscar Barry Levison according to Roman Philip Roth, has a 40-year-old Pacino's role, which is close to him: an actor at the top of fame who suffers from depression at the end of his career and personal life.
But to see him immediately the second day as a strange owner of railways from the rural town of Manglehorn, which David Gordon Green filmed, it was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi's cup for the best artistic performance should not miss it - but does the artist still have a patient's format of demand prices?
Perhaps the most satisfying love of the public is for him, and especially for the Italian, because even though he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country from which his parents come.
Body for Italy
The Italian film is still doing very well in Venice this year.
The black soul, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first image of Birdman's remunerated long breath.
The Mafia calabrian ratio is taken into consideration by looking at the family relations between clans that fight each other for power and money, and the director managed to match all the assumptions for a good movie: a quality scenario, camera, music and actors.
He also sucked the chamber psychothriller Cold Heart, who filmed Saverio Costanzo with Albo Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost lost her own child in her lucky discomfort.
On the contrary, the French competition films did not expect the warm reception of neither the Compulsory for Glory, nor the 3 Hearts, both of which adhere to the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of artistic representatives.
But in the end, two really exciting movies, Birdman and Black Soul, are not so little at the first half of the festival.
And perhaps the festival images have a completely depressive subject, the new picture of Peter Bogdanovich, named She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy mentioned in Venice outside the competition and staged in the style of American cheerleaders for 40 years, has been able to raise the mood for more than one day.
Police arrested four pervitin producers in Prague, vehicles from Poland
"The detectives held three men in the last days at the age of 42, 42 and 37 and a five-year-old woman who produced and sold pervitin drugs in Prague from last November to this August," said police spokesman Jan Rössler.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, an intervention unit in the Cillářské Street caught an organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman, who represented in the group as a buyer of medicines in Poland and a seller of a dose.
The following day, the detectives were detained on the basis of the previous consent of the State representative of the next member of the group, a man of seventy years.
The last of the four policemen arrived in the middle of the morning hours of August 20th in the area of small burning," the speaker described.
For the transport of drugs from Poland, a third woman received drugs
The main organizer had a wide range of activities.
In the airport area, in the garden house in Horomeříčí, in the apartment in Konevova street and in other places in Prague, he produced pervitin, used various aids and chemicals necessary to produce it and ensured the transport of medicines with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He also weighed the manufactured drug, divided it into plastic bags, and then sold the pervitin.
With the transfer of drugs from Poland or the sale of drugs, she has helped him for five and a half years.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drugs manufactured," Rössler added.
On the basis of the judge's order, the criminals also carried out a number of domestic inspections, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, pay bags, injection syringes, snakes and other aids and items that can be considered as complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
Dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
"From the available records, the police have found that since 1995, the chief organizer has been tried seven times as a result of the property criminal activity, and the court-married woman has not been tried," the police spokesman added.
The last detention in 2006 was conditionally convicted of sexual abuse and the seven-year-old driver, who has been released, has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
And with him, it was mostly a crime of property.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a criminal offence of unlawful production and other charges involving fraudulent and psychotropic substances and poisons, which threatens them up to decades of imprisonment.
Finally, three persons were asked by the investigator to propose a proposal for a tie, where the judge finally placed it," the speaker said.
The fourth defendant, a seventy-year-old recidivist, ended up free.
His position and role in this case was not as important as that of the other accused.
The cops are still working with this man.
Ferraris are offering wood and carbon chess.
Ferrari offers within its other products very interesting things for a lot of "interesting" prices.
As a good example, handmade chess with a board size of 42 x 42 cm is needed in Italy.
If you like, prepare more than 40,000 CZK.
The exact price is 43 405 CZK.
The customer will obtain a set of wooded black and red lacquered figures stored in a wooden box made of carbon fibres.
No one will be surprised to know that the classic rider has the player’s seat on the horse.
If the chess does not seem to you as a sufficiently valuable gift, the Ferrari 500 F2 model is also available (especially manually) in scale 1:1,8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
It doesn't make any sense to drop high school and high school.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people and statistics also show that gymnasiumists have good application.
The beginning of school year is here.
During the last 14 days, large preparations were made.
Most of these are routine matters, such as transporting flowers from the summer warehouse back to class and drawing up the wings.
They're going to have a little bigger frmols at the hot gym.
A few days before the start of the season, the equipment, computers, and other technical equipment and literature are available in the library.
There was no robbery, four years of high school in the mountains after three years, and it opened up and resumed its activity.
Not on the public, but on the private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the inability of the founders.
They had to wait to see if the existence of a school would be confirmed by a registration of a school managed by the MSMT.
"French socialists should shut down and put France in order," says the key associate Francoise Holland
Valls calls for a highly fragmented left to "show his support" to a war-dominated socialist president whose new division of functions was not met with the consent of most of the French.
The President deserves general respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay behind him," he said and bowed.
As a calm gesture, the president of the government insisted that his government would not question the controversial French thirty-five-hour work week, despite the passionate facts by Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who at the beginning of the week proposed to set the rules free.
On Saturday, the Dutch asked the Socialists to remain "consistent" with the government.
Christiane Taubirová, Minister of Justice, made him a bit of a budget when she appeared at the meeting of the rebel Socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist side for "the French have lost their faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, a leader of extremely conservative rights, with unresolved internal disputes between the socialists, when she said she did not assume that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Holland is naked and Prince Manuel Valls was also forced to form a new government when the former did not last until the end of the years.
"And the new will not last until the end of winter or winter," Le Pen told his guests.
She reiterated her party's call for Parliament's dissolution and declared that she was convinced that it could win early elections and that it was ready to rule the country.
The French ruling party has suffered defeat in March's municipal elections and in May has achieved an extremely conservative right in elections to the European Parliament.
According to a survey of the public opinion of the Journal du Dimanche, 76% of the French feel that the Socialist Party is at risk of dividing itself into several competing groups before the end of the 2017 working period.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French will soon be patient unless the new socialist government can improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that the situation is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could worsen.
Hazard and street art Prague no longer limits elections
The changes in the relevant statements should be prepared and approved by the new management of the capital.
From the street Prague does not disappear before the municipal elections other games and the city will not limit street art.
There will be no limit to the wedding of dogs.
The threshold shall not reach the October elections to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant statements.
"In addition, the decision on changes should not be made by the current management of the city, which ends in a few weeks' term," said the Council of Lukas Manhart (TOP 09).
In the past weeks, several councillors, such as Prague 5 and 7, decided to cancel a flat-rate accident in their territory.
But Herny doesn't disappear, the gambling statement won't change until now.
It's the task of the new city's leadership after the election.
Now we would not technically achieve this, for example, in terms of time-limits for commenting and so on," Manhart explained.
He added that the last session of the current representative, which must be approved by the amendment of the declaration, was held on 11 September.
The referendum on the flat ban on gambling will be held on the day of municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
The gambling ban is currently applicable, for example in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the statement will not change in the case of street art, so-called search.
In particular, he complains about Prague 1, which has already sent the magistrate a proposal for places that she would like to expand the current list of prohibited places.
The musicians also don't want Praha 5 around Angela.
A ruling on the city's wedding of dogs takes several months, so far it's not over.
The location of the game and the problem of searching solves city statements.
It can only be issued or adjusted by the representative of the capital.
The Councils have only a advisory vote, they cannot issue statements themselves.
Last week he put victory over Scottish independence proponents on the reach of the hand
The campaign for Scotland's independence was in danger of making this mistake the third time she had little to put on billboards all over Scotland asking if Scotland wanted to be rich.
But you won't get to the hearts of Scottish fans by appealing to their wallets, and you won't get their respect when you start threatening them.
The morale of the New Law is still alive in Scotland, even though only a few Scottish people still go to church today.
The Scottish have a far greater tendency to avoid the changers from the temple than to let them dictate how they should vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists Alex Salmon knows this well, and that's why in the television discussion he repeatedly questioned his rival, the Unionist Darling, whether it's willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people", if the Scottish voters vote for independence, and start supporting the single currency for Scotland and England.
It made Darling choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he fell into this trap with a grin.
Of course, Darling doesn't support the command of Scottish volunteers.
However, the debate about what Scotland will have was already more neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the ferocity, work opportunities and the protection of public health, which have citizens free of charge.
Darling supported London's bankers in the currency and also raised the impression that he would not protest against privatization of health.
As Salmon said, "he went into bed with the conservators."
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish policy.
Every Scottish man knows that the Scottish businessmen are in bed with a conservative.
That's what David Cameron confirmed, who in Scotland spoke not to the voters, but to the "boss" association, to the British Industry Confederation.
It is becoming clear that Cameroon's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmonde was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a missing housewife.
The Scottish would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron could at least say that Scotland could be "a successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it affects almost physical pain.
What he's saying is clear: Scotch don't jump and have to accept what it is.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic start of school according to Milos Urban
Illustration of the story Longest year
Miloš Urban Longest year
The end of the holiday was the best, the last week that's gone nowhere, and we just got fired and caught up with Grandma in the summer, quiet before the storm, calm before the stress.
New clothes when it came from Tuzex, boots from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, already submerged, hanging on a circle up around the Imperial to the back behind the Vary, some to tennis court, was no longer hot, the sun starved back and shoulder, glued the paprika to the disbanded.
Tonight's a little nervous, still a holiday, sleeping at 11 a.m., in a week, it'll get worse, just a few minutes to two hours before bed, then get up at 7:00 in the morning.
It's coming Monday.
Most people don't, on the contrary, this summer, he's been sneaking around in front of school.
Applicable in a flashlight on the plate and look like a plastic sticker in glassed weight, there's the school, ZDŠ A.
An old-known face and a couple of new, young boys out there, girls in the chest.
There are predators, those who avoid it, it's just as interesting how they keep their relationship unexplained and how fast they're here.
And these grown-up girls, who came in, they're now hysterically laughing at something, maybe something in their life has changed during the holidays, while everything is with me at the old time.
And the new cousins, some nerves and some other joys, why do they even lie here?
Because it has to be a military duty.
So inside, the cold humidity of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned schoolgirl with the mop, unfortunately, still the same thing that lends a frog a key from the patch box, where they can keep the disciples and which are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dress is still in memory, now it's not good, it's pretty grown, but it's going to get worse in a week.
It's the only thing that's going on here is the stomach and the headache starts.
A head that's even worse to learn from mathematics, the devil's game for the chosen ones, among whom I don't belong, and I'll never be.
Again, the three and four, no doubt five, hide before the test, go into the lab and get the best out of it, be there, exist only as a name in the classroom, and still dream stories about nicer girls and beautiful buildings, about antennas in the universe, where nobody bothers with anyone, does not humiliate anyone, and does not insult anyone's foot.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's just the first day now, like years ago.
The birth daughter left her to die.
She's in danger of an exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first birth occurred in March 2012 in the public toilet cabin at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without help from a stranger, she was born a girl who, after cutting the doll, hid under a blanket and took her to a road guide where she was placed in a cave some ten metres from the road.
She was born on her way to school.
It came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
I had to go to the bathroom on the bus, and I was born there.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut through the papyrus rope with the knives I carried to school," she described the accused and said she was ashamed of being pregnant.
"The next day she went back to the place, put the child's body in the trunk and drove it away, took the body out of the trunk, wrapped it in a black needle tube and hid it and left under the shelter of her grandmother in Havlíčka Broda," she complains that it is not quite obvious when the birth of a newborn came to an end.
It could be ten minutes, but also a few hours after birth, breathing when covered by the blanket or being put under the blanket, cooling or bleeding from the unsweetened doll.
A similar scenario was repeated next year in the spring.
A woman in the early hours of yesterday to April 12th, when a dead child was found with random witnesses under a kull at a fisherman in Havlíčkobrodska, gave birth to her own secret.
This time in the bathroom of the basement apartment in the family house.
Without checking whether she was born alive, and without cutting off, and slapping the dove, which was wrapped around her neck, she put the child into several plastic bags, including Igelite bags, and left him in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon hours, he and his partner were taken to the fishermen.
After all, she's been hit by a friend.
The father of both children was just a friend accused, who apparently didn't know about the partner's pregnancy.
Even for this reason they are not now before the court, he was only punished for a crime against the funeral law.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like him being punished as a co-worker.
He manipulated my child against my will.
I know that my solution was not right, but it came to me as a human being at the time," she did not hide the bitterness of the accused, who allegedly in relation to the man was subjected to and feared him.
During her interview, a young woman spoke fairly.
The tears in her eyes until the moment she talked about the relationship with her parents, from which she left when she was full.
She didn't want to kill.
"They come to me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she exclaimed.
I didn't get my equipment, because I didn't want the kids, I looked young.
I wanted to put him in the babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't.
I can't explain that to you," the judge answered.
She refused, however, to act with the thought and intention of killing a newborn.
According to her claim, the second child was also born dead.
Even in pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I've restricted it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I even restricted smoking," she said.
Although pregnancy was seen in both cases, all of her repeated questions claimed that she had a health problem that she was pregnant.
And that's a friend.
The main trial will continue in the civil court in Tuesday's statements by the judges.
On Wednesday, a verdict could be reached.
A woman is threatened with a criminal rate of up to 18 years in prison, possibly an exceptional penalty.
Norwegian Cruise is approaching the three-billion-dollar purchase of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the whole issue, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the third largest operator of the world's shipping fleet, has advanced in the purchase of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for about three billion dollars.
The Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, which competes with the greater competition Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), has made it possible to access luxury cruise ships Prestige Cruises and rich customers.
The agreement may be published this week, it has produced a source on Sunday, but it has noted that the negotiations still do not have to be successful.
Owner Prestige Cruises, private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% share in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources were not named because the negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, spokesperson Apollo refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise is based in Miami, operates thirteen sailing ships in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's admission in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the trademarks of Oceania and Regent, which together own eight passenger ships flying to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
In 2013, the company notified the markets of $1.2 billion, 6% more than in the previous year.
It is expected that in the coming year, the 90 billion segment of travel vessels will benefit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies such as China and India.
The companies are competing for the preferred option for these customers to choose the fleets.
The company Prestige Cruises registered the first public offer in January 2014.
Apollo has a majority share in the company since 2007 since the closing of the business of $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its present form since 2000, when it came to contact with the tour operator Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of businesses engaged in leisure and casinos controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested in Norwegian Cruise one billion dollars.
Norwegian Cruise launched a stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration by the regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting owned a share of 28 %, Apollo 20 % and a private investment company TPG Capital LP 8 %.
According to the registration, the first public offers include Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises as well as 82% of the volume of North American passengers.
Pro-democratic activists in Hong Kong provoke Chinese authorities on the day after the vote decision
There was a group of loyal people around Beijing who had Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates were elected in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support from the nomination committee, which will probably consist of members of the faithful Beijing.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democracies to get to the polls and to persuade pro-democratic activists to renew their promises and to safeguard the financial centre of Hong Kong's protests of the occupation of the Centre.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tension, Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratisation will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report on the Chinese government in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists organized an informal referendum on elections in the special official district and hundreds of thousands of people entered and occupied the city's trading district.
The press conference, attended by Prime Minister Li, is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, several press conferences were also to be held by the Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Committee of Zhang Ronghsun and the Deputy Director of the State Council of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei.
Student activists have declared that they are meeting in front of the Hong Kong government's office this afternoon.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kyev to start negotiations with Eastern Ukraine on "state sovereignty"
According to a description of the events by Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and to start an immediate discussion on the "state sovereignty" of the disbanded areas.
His spokesman Dmitrij Peskov later explained that Putin did not intend to point out that the eastern Ukrainian areas under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be overrated so that the Russians would have the power to protect their rights and interests.
Putin's challenge to the Kyiv government to deal with the pro-russian rebels as equals is in line with the clear strategy, which was followed five months ago: Help the separatists to occupy the territory and make the Ukrainian government give the newly declared Novorusk a real independence so that he can connect to the West with Russia.
In the interview for the first state television channel Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions, which are to re-activate the eastern regions of Doneneck and Luhansk, which ruled the separatists in March and April after Moscow invaded the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists of the newly occupied territories were named "Novorusko" or "New Russia", a term referring to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass has published Putin's words, according to which "the prison is illustrative" everyone who believes that peace is in sight, because Ukrainian politicians launched a campaign in front of the October 26th parliamentary elections, while government units are attacking civilian population in the areas of controlled separatists.
"In the interests of people living in these areas, we need to start meaningful negotiations immediately, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and on the status of state sovereignty of the south-east of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putinov's violation of state sovereignty was thought of in the context of a broader autonomy, which, with Kyje's leadership, has been one for several months and is intended to alleviate the concerns of Russian speaking areas from the threat of cultural and language rights.
Peskov stated that the necessary autonomy can only be granted to the eastern region by the Ukrainian government.
It is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The progress of the Kremlin speaker, who had to correct the "wrong interpretation" of Putin's notes, highlighted the Russian leadership's approach to resolving the rise of the separatists in the east, which is different from the Krim's open siege, where most of the two million people come from ethnic Russians.
Moscow should also have a much greater difficulty in polling Doneneck and Luhansk in the east of Ukraine, as the majority of 6.5 million people are not Russians and public opinion polls, which have been carried out even before the conflict, have shown widespread support for the collapse in Ukraine.
The autonomy of the Russian diplomats acting at international forums would give the regional government in Ukraine the power to determine its own trade agreements and international relations, and essentially to give Kremla effective control over the territory that would link the Russian fortress with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was established five months ago, is the home of the main Russian maritime fleets, maritime trade grounds and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between the Russian Rostov and Crimea are also centrally down, manufactured and soldered, which make important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, during his opening speech on 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislators - after new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give different regions more control over their finances and language status.
This vision of autonomy, however, differs significantly from that of Kremlin and separatists. Moscow is accused of weaponization and incitement of violence.
Putin's last challenge was that Kyev acted as a separatist as she followed the other procedure of the rebels last week after Russian units and tanks from the former peaceful area along the Azov Sea penetrated eastern Ukraine.
The Russian separatists took control of Novozazski in such a way that Ukrainian security authorities are worried that it is a goal to occupy strategic coastal areas until Crimea.
This has strengthened the enormous civil and military effort to secure Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500 000 inhabitants lying between Novozazski and a narrow entrance gate to the Crimean Peninsula.
The report was held on Saturday at a meeting of the leading representatives of the European Union in Brussels and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," warned Porosenko.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the case of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, a speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovakia after last week two columns of Russian armed vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the Danube area to support dressed separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were arrested in Ilovak during the Russian invasion were replaced on Sunday by 10 Russian rebels arrested in Ukraine last week, Lysenko said on Sunday.
In the scandal with the photos discovered there are also Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disappointment over the hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancee Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after, in the biggest scandal with hacked photos, the celebrity got on the Internet series of explicit photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker claims to have sixty naked photos of Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevenne, singer Rihanny, Ariany Grande and Ley Michellov and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Because of the departure from iCloud, the public reportedly also received personal photos of Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who asked for his hand last month, said to the magazine Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information is given to steal and spread to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, reports online news that hacking is "unhappiness" and those who have become his target "are subject to humiliation".
It's considered that the hacker got thirty photos of Palmer with an ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two images on which he's on top of the pool without breaking up.
Palmer had an effect, for example, on the film of Love and honor, where she was her rival Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of Chuck Strahowski's television series and the actress from the sucker Punch Browning last night, the stolen pictures were not commented on.
The representative of Lawrence TMZ said: "It is a clear breach of privacy."
Herec Seth Rogen hacker on his Twitter criticised: "Publicing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigmy footballers liked Lebra, and without winning
Olomouc - Chromes and lightnings that co-founder of the Olomouc Sigmy Josef Lébr sent to his subordinate last week are, it seems, past.
The only thing they brought from Opava was a point for a free shirt.
By setting up and fighting the club boss, they just got a little better.
The payout money could come to the club soon.
"I'm leaving another match as I talked about it last week, but I'm far more optimistic," Lebr confirmed, despite the fact that Sigma didn't win, the players convinced her by improved performance.
The battle and the arrangement we played mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In such a case, I'm able to forgive that he won't win.
If we were to play this game from the beginning of the season, I'd be convinced that we haven't lost yet," Lebr thinks.
Sigma in Opava stopped the initial pressure on the home, then the game was balanced, and in the second half it was better.
After Kalvod's victory, the devotees fell, but they didn't reach the goal, so they couldn't win.
The result is not according to our imagination.
We lacked complete satisfaction, but only one changed chance," said Lébr, who did not think that a change in the approach of the footballers was just his threat.
There must have been more aspects there.
Whether on my side, on the side of the coach, or on the side of the fans," Lebr said.
With pressure, Sigma has to count.
The players did not want to comment on the events of the past week after the match.
I'm trying to get these things out of here.
I tried not to let it down," the young blacksmith Michal Reichl cut his head off.
Without a comment, he left a question on Lebro's statement from last week's attacker Václav Vasiček, who did not change the biggest opportunity of Sigmy in the Saturday match.
After all, he was just talking about the pressure.
We're still under pressure.
Everybody wants to pull on us.
Today we've shown that if we fight and drive everyone in the ass, it'll go away," he said.
Warnings came to the heart
Even Leoš Kalvoda’s viewer did not insist that the preparation for the match was not the simplest view of the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouci last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was seen that Mr. Lebra's warning took it to heart.
Even though it wasn't about not wanting to fight and throw it away before," the Olympic coach said.
It was like today's first fifteen minutes.
It lasted before we compared ourselves to the toughness and realized what the other lie was about.
That it's not just football, it's mainly fighting," Calvoda said.
There is only hope that in future matches, Sigma will work from the beginning.
"I'd love to believe it," he added.
