The members of the Governing Body are concerned that “they seem like plants ”
Some members of the Assembly expressed concern about the proposal to change their name to MWP (some member of the Velsa Parliament).
This relates to the intention to replace the Assembly's name with the Wales Parliament.
The members of the Assembly were concerned that this could lead to a political act of ridicule.
One member of the Darbo Assembly said that his group was concerned that “it was confined to Twp and Pwp”.
Not for Welsh readers: "twp" means "twp", and "pwp" means "something".
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the whole group was "unsatisfied" and offered alternatives.
The Velsa conservative claimed that his group was "open" because of the change in the name, but noted that it was a reduction in the word from MWP to "green".
In the same way, the English language of Yorkshire was said to be the same.
The committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing draft legislation for the appointment, said: "The final decision on all the names of the members of the Assembly will of course be the matter of the members themselves."
In 2017, the Law of the Wales Government granted the Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals that called for strong support for the Assembly to be appointed by the Wales Parliament.
As regards the name of the members of the Assembly, the Commission gave priority to members of the Wales Parliament or WMP, but during the public consultations, MWP called for the highest support.
Members of the Assembly are obviously offering alternative opportunities, but efforts to reach an agreement may become a matter of concern to President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislative amendments within a few weeks.
Legislation on the scope of the reforms and other amendments to the work of the Assembly, including rules on the plan for the disqualification of a member of the Assembly and of the Committee's system.
The members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote during the legislative debate on what they should be called.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change in the name of the country
On Sunday, the voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote was held to resolve a ten-year dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its name for the northern neighbourhood represents claims to the territory of Greece and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's efforts to join the EU and NATO.
The opposition to the plebiscite for the change in the name of Macedonia, President Gjorge Ivanov said the vote would be wrong.
However, representatives of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change in the name is simply a price that is simply to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's and other churches have suffered in Harlem's difficulties
"The old people I spoke to said that historically on each corner there was a bar and a church," said Adams.
– Today there is no one or one."
He said he understood why the bars disappeared.
“In these times people interact differently,” he said.
– There are only no neighbourhood sites where people are gathered all the time."
Speaking of the churches, he is concerned that the money that would be gained after the sale will not go as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will go back where they started.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by multiples with cooperative apartments in which people who would not help the rest of the holidays would live.
"The majority of people who buy these multi-stakeholder cooperative apartments will be white," he said, "and will therefore speed up the moment when the church will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who have moved to these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built in 1870 in white congregations, before Harlem became a black metropolis in the metropolitan community, and St. Marty’s church was built ten years later.
The first congregation of white Methodists was formed in the tenth century B.C.E.
After the construction of the black congregation in the vicinity of the temple, the name of the building was taken over.
The church of St. Martyn took over the black congregation with the priest John Howard Johnson, who led the minority boycott in 125th Street, at the main store in Harlem, where he was denied employment or higher post.
The building was destroyed by fire in 1939, but since the spiritual father’s cousin Johnson planned to restore it, they ordered the soldiers.
The priest David Johnson, the son of the spiritual father Johnson, and the heir to the church of St. Marty’s, praised the emperor as a beggar.
Experts who beat the lion to the soldier named it "cultural lobby" and "unchangeable historical instrument".
At the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng also mentioned that it was the first warrior in the world to be played by the black musician Dionysius A. Linds. 18 years ago he began to play a larger warrior in the Riversaid church.
Merriweather said that St. Martyn's church did not change his other musician.
What happened in the last few months in St. Martin's church was a difficult history of architects and contractors, some of which were called upon by the church worlds, others by the Bishop of the Episcopal Church.
Zacristija, a parapia management body made up of world leaders, expressed concern to the bishop in July that the bishop "will try to transfer expenses" to the crucifixes, although it did not build the architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some subscribers complained that the bishop lacked transparency.
The Russians in California injured the winner of the 13th anniversary of the U.S.
Officials reported that on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy when he was in California on the day of the opening of the hummingbird season.
It was surrounded 7 hours ago by Ensinitas near the beach of the Light.
Chad Hammelis San Diego's KSWB-TV performances said that he had snored with friends about half an hour in the morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and then came back with the group to help him get out of the water.
Hamel said to me first that the boy was worried about getting a bear, but then he realized that the boy was shouting: “I’m in love with you!
I'm intruded!"
Hamelis said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire cell was broken.
"I called out to everyone to drink from the water, "The shark is floating in the water!" Hamelis added.
The boy was killed by a plane to the San Diego Children's Hospital, where he was admitted to being critical.
It's not known what kind of boy was attacked by a shark.
The rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a few weeks ago a shark was observed in that area, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
The officers closed the beach from Casablanca Ponto to Ensinitas Swamio for 48 hours due to the investigation and protection.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
"Sainsbury's" is planning a slave to the UK beauty market.
"Sainsbury's" takes over "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with the beauty of the universal store-style sections where specialists will work.
Actively moving to the US market of 2,8 billion pounds of sterling beauty, which continues to grow and the sales of fashion and household goods are declining, larger sections of beauty goods will be tested throughout the country and, if they are successful, more shops will be installed in the next year.
Investments in beauty are growing, and shopping centers are looking for ways to use a table for televisions, microwaves and household items.
"Sainsbury's" reported that it doubles its beauty range to 3,000 product names, including signs such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of "L'Oreal", "Maybellline" and "Burt's Bees" will also get more local brand areas similar to those in stores like "Boots".
The shopping centre also reissues its "Boutique" makeup range, most of which are vegan products – this is increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will try discounts in the two Saintsbury's shops, from which the first week of the week was opened in Croatia, South London, and the second one later this year in Seli Ouke, Birmingham.
As a result of the purchase of the internet and the desire to buy small quantities of local retail outlets every day, the shopping malls need to make more efforts to attract people to visit there.
Sainsbury’s Director General Mike’s Coupe said that corporate shops are increasingly like universal shops, as the trading centres’ networks are trying to fight the selling goods by offering more services and non-food to the more expensive Aldi and Lidl shops.
Sainsbury's included Argo's sellers in hundreds of stores and also installed many Habitat stores, because two years ago they bought both networks, which, as it is said, strengthened the sale of food and their purchase was more profitable.
The previous attempt by the centre of commerce to update its beauty and medicine section was unsuccessful.
In the beginning of the first decade of this century, Sinsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended up arguing about how to distribute revenues from drug dealers in malls.
A new strategy arose after "Sainsbury's" sold 125 million pounds a year ago to the owner of the "Celesio" network in its 281 pharmaceutical stores.
It was said that Lloyds' contribution to this plan was added to the extended range of luxury leather branding, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Sonsbury's commercial director Paul Mills-Hicks said: "We have changed the outer and the atmosphere of beauty compartments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialized colleagues who will be prepared to give advice.
The range of our trademarks has been designed to meet every need, and because of the attractive environment and comfortable places we are now a beautiful place to challenge the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "accompanied" because Holly Willoughby has stopped his 11 million-weight sterling deal with him.
"Dragon Den" star Peter Jones "entered" after the TV show Holly Willoughby stopped the 11 million-dollar deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
H. Willoughby no longer has time for their home circulation and accessory brand "Truly".
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand.
The 37-year-old "This Morning" race led by Instagram reported leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the mark of a profitable lifestyle to focus on his new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, destroyed the Dragons Den by the star Peter Jones.
The sources say that Jones was "accommodated" when a gold television girl at his business empire headquarters in Marlou (Bakingamshire) at the meeting Tuesday night, admitted that she would no longer be allowed to use the "Truly" brand for new transactions with up to 1.5 million pounds.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and was expected to double H. Willoughby's 11 million weight sterling asset.
Because in 37 years of age, Mr. Willoughby's "Instagram" reported the remaining "Truly", Jones leaves the United Kingdom to one of his summers.
The source said: "Truly" has so far been one of the most important Holly priorities.
It should have been her long-term future, pushing for the next couple of decades.
Its decision to go out surprised everyone.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, because the beginning was so close.
There is a full stock of ready to sell in Marlou's living room."
Experts believe that the launch of The Morning Bay, one of the most financially successful stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company millions because of large investments in products, starting with pillows and candles and finishing clothes and household items, as well as because it will be delayed to start.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, H. Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the decade.
In 2016, H. Willoughby and T. Cappu established Truly, and 52 years of P. Jones joined the battle as president.
The couple travel together, and Mr Jones has 40% of Baldwin's production shares.
H. Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace ITV series I'm A Celebrity led by Ant McPartlin.
Jonah’s next source said yesterday: “We will not know his business.”
We talked hard and “then we fell in love ”
He smiled at the criticism received from the media about the comment made, which some might consider to be "unpresidency", as well as the positive reaction of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump say so much?
A short, trusted “new leader” said in a voice:
"I didn't say anything."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was held a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
However, the nuclear disarmament negotiations have been closed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's highest-ranking diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not come from the US "responsibility" for the early disarmament of North Korea.
He noted that instead of the US, there are further sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his short speech, he expressed a much more optimistic attitude.
"We are well followed by North Korea," he said.
– We intend to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We now support these wonderful relationships."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had led to positive results: it ended with rocket tests, relief aid and return to the U.S. Army.
He defended his unusual attitude by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be a president, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to get to this crowded arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing here," said Shortas, pointing to the mine standing right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunamis and earthquake destroyed the island by killing hundreds of people
Following the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the people of Lomboko were disbanded, this was not announced in the national disaster – a necessary condition for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been said very clearly that international aid is not needed, so it is a bit difficult," said Sumbung.
Although "Delivering children" prepares a team to travel to Pala, it is not yet clear whether workers working abroad can work on the spot.
The representative of the National Disaster Agency, Sutopo, said that the Indonesian officials appreciated the situation of Paul in order to know whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In view of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country has not yet prepared the natural species.
Although the trailers from the tsunami were built in Aceh, they are not common on the other shores.
Because of the apparent lack of tsunami-warning sirens, Paul, despite the announced warning, was likely to increase the lives of the dead.
Traveling among many Indonesian islands is the best time.
In the face of disasters, logistics is becoming even more complex.
The Lomboke-displaced hospital ship, which treats victims of earthquakes, sails to Pale, but the new disaster will reach its destination at least three days later.
President Joko Widodo chose the restoration of Indonesia's broken infrastructure at the centre of his election campaign, he generously spent money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not give peace to the Yoko administration, as in the coming years it will again take part in the elections.
No one also faces pressure from the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims hold a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes because of the use of cats, rifles, and other simple weapons by Christians and Muslims in the fight against war.

The number of deaths from Indonesian tsunamis is already in the range of 832
As reported by the country’s disaster agency last Sunday, the number of deaths in Indonesia increased from earthquakes and tsunamis up to 832.
The Agency’s press representative at the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Press Conference reported that many people had been shut down in the caves of buildings damaged by a 7.5-ball earthquake on Friday, a 6-metre wave.
Among the cities where more than 380,000 people live, the ruins of ruined buildings have been destroyed.
Police took a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after the death of a woman
The murder investigation was initiated after the female body was found this morning at Berkenhede (Mersidad).
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. on the street of Greison Mouse, John, with a 32-year-old man who was arrested in the murder.
The police have called on people who have seen or heard to say something in the territory.

I would also like to ask all, especially taxi drivers, who could have recorded something with the video recorder, and contact us because they can have information that is essential to our research."
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was Berkenheda's local resident and she was found in the bed.
This afternoon, friends who knew my wife came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing because the police have reported that it informs the affected relatives.
Graison Mouse, a taxi driver who lived, just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police said that no one could enter the building and get out of it.
He lost his promise when he found out what had happened.
People are now told that they will have to wait a few hours until they are allowed to return home.

Parliament's Cromvell statues are being hit by the last blow of the "historic rewriting" dispute.
Its removal would be a poetic justice for the acts of the Taliban which commemorates the destruction of the cultural and religious heritage of England, for which the fanatic followers of Cromwell Puritans are responsible.
However, Kromvell's company described Mr. Crick's proposal as a "circle" and a "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmithas, chairman of the Kromwell Society, said: “During the current discussions on the transfer of statues, Oliver Kromwell’s statue to the Westminster Chamber must have been a quiet one.
Cromvelis did not declare the iconoclassism of the English Civil Wars and did not.
Perhaps not that Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of Father Tom in the past century.
The beautiful image of the Cromwell, created by Ser William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a reflection of the 19th century's view and the figure that many still value to respect.
Goldsmithas "The Sunday Telegraph" said: "Many people, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, Kromvelis was considered a defender of Parliament from external pressure, and this was, of course, a monarchy.
Whether this is completely accurate, historically disputed so far.
One thing is clear that the 17th-century conflict formed a later development of our people, and Kromvelis became an outstanding figure representing one of the sides of this tako.
It is for the LORD to make mention and to honour, even as the LORD hath made.
The pig killed a Chinese farmer mortally
According to local media reports, pigs attacked and killed the farmer in the southwestern Chinese turf.
Morning Post reported on Sunday that a dead man named Yuan was found. Because of the damaged artery, he was encrusted with blood and lying next to a pig in the Liupanjus turgue, Guidju Province (South China).
On 30 May 2005 the pig producer in Sining (Chinghai Province, China) prepared to inject the vaccine into pigs in pigs.
He reported that on Wednesday, along with his half brother from the neighboring province of Junan, he intends to travel to the markets to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the half brother found his family dead and found the door opened to the nearby quail.
He said that there was a great plague in the pig’s mouth with blood.
As stated in the report, the Court’s expert confirmed that the pig weighing 250 kilograms had hit the farmer.
"Guyang Evening News" quoted: "My cousin's legs were bloody and hurt," said the cousin, who named himself Wu, .
The protection camera filmed material showed Yuan entering the turgine at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
A man who was killed by Yuan or his half brother did not belong to him.
The Turkish leader told Evening News that the pig had to be shut down so that other people would no longer be beaten, and keep up until the police pick up evidence on the spot.
It is reported that the Yuan family and the Turkish authorities are in charge of the death compensation.
However, cases of swine fever have been reported in the past.
In 2016, pigs attacked the woman and her husband in the farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly dangerously injured.
Ten years ago, 295 pounds [295 kg] of porcupine pressed Velsa’s farmer to the tractor and pressed him until the animal was brought back to life.
After the pig was the farmer of Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer "CBC News" said that pigs are not usually aggressive, but aggression can lead to the taste of blood.
“They are just playful.
They love pain, they're very clever... they didn't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
The "judgment" of the Uruguayan Rose brings a lot of things to the U.S. on the south
It is predicted that the hurricane is weakening by moving through the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring a lot of things to the whole of North Mexico and the United States on the south.
On Sunday, from 5 o'clock in the morning, Rosa moved 137 km/h as a 1 category hurricane and was 620 km south of the Euchenian Bay (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, on the edge of the Pacific, there is the formation of an extended area of low pressure and moving east, towards the west coast of the United States. As Roza approaches the California Peninsula on Monday as an atoper audre, she will start to carry large atoper water to the north, to the south of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 centimeters [25 cm] in some areas of Mexico.
In the coming days, the humidity of the atrices, which interacts with the surrounding area of the low pressure, will bring a great flood of rains to the south.
Instead, from 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rain will result in dangerous sudden flooding, crash current and possible desertification.
Due to the high humidity in some places, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, a drop of between 5 and 8 centimeters per hour.
5 to 8 centimeters of rain is expected in the southern regions, particularly in the main part of Arizona.
As a result of the nature of the atrical rains, a sudden flood and rapid deterioration of conditions has taken place.
A particularly poor idea of attracting dust on foot would come as the approach of the surrounding storms.
The heavy rain cannons can be turned into sinking rivers, and the percussion would result in wind and dust.
A nearby low pressure area will bring some local heavy rains to the southern coast of California.
It is expected that more than 1 centimeter of droplets can cause a small drop stream and the paths can become smooth.
This would be the first drop in the wet season in the region.
Some of the thunderstorms will begin to approach Arizona’s late Sunday and early Monday, and later rain will spread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will follow Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and South America on Tuesday and continue Wednesday.
The cave can be intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, because the Arctic is old, but the surrounding area will be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to major changes in temperature in small distances.
On Sunday, there was a great example of major temperature differences in the Central US.
Kanzas Sičio (Missuris) and Omaha (Nebraska) temperature is almost 20 degrees different from the temperature of Saint Luis and Di Moino (Ajova).
During the coming few days the summer heat should be maintained and more space should be added.
It is expected that in the major central and eastern parts of the United States, from the Great South to the northern eastern regions, the warmest October with much above 27 degrees.
The temperature in New York should rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is the average of about 10 degrees above.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the Eastern US temperature will be higher in the first half of October than the average multiannual temperature.
Over 20 million people attended the Bretto Kavanaugh court meeting
More than 20 million people attended the announcements made by the Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh on Thursday during the six television broadcasts and by Christian Blasey Ford's women in the ninth year of sexual violence.
However, the political acclimatisation continued after the broadcasters stopped their regular programmes on Friday's last minute change: the Arizona senator had reached an agreement to conduct a weekly investigation by the FTB on urban charges.
Ford to the Senate court committee said it was absolutely true that the high school evening Kavanaugh had grabbed her and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh's bad witness said he was absolutely true that it wasn't.
Nielsen reported on Friday that there may have been more than 20.4 million people watching the broadcast.
The company calculated the average number of viewers viewing the broadcasting via CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available to other networks, including "PBS", "C-SPAN" and "Fox Business Network".
In addition, Nielsen usually has certain difficulties in calculating persons watching television in offices.
In order to explain more clearly, it is an audience of the same size as it would be in the event of accruing football matches or Oscar prizes.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, led from all networks when the number of viewers reached an average of 5.69 million during the day-to-day hearing.
ABC, with 3.26 million viewers, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS received 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million, CNN – 2.52 million.
A great deal of interest remained after the trial.
The main feature of the Friday drama was Flake’s.
After a small Republican Bureau issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, it was joined by CNN and CBS Chambers on Friday morning, when the protestors called on him, trying to lift him up to the Court Committee meeting.
CNN directly filmed it with the eyes thrown below when it was washed by people.
"I am standing here before you," said one woman.
– Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
He was told: “You have power when so many women are helpless. ”
Flake said that his office issued a statement and, before closing the elevator, added that he would have to say more at the sitting of the Court Committee.
The cable television and broadcasting networks were subsequently discussed directly when the Court Committee voted for the candidacy of Kavanaugh to the Senate.
However, Flake’s said that this would only be done by knowing that the FTB would investigate charges against the candidate in the coming week, whose investigation was called for by a minority of Democrats.
Flake, speaking to his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons, was partly convinced.
After speaking to Coons and several senators, Flake’s decision was taken.
Flake’s choice had power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trumpas launched an FTB investigation into suspicions against Kavanaugh.
Minister of Great Britain blames critics for "playing politics" about "Brexit"
President Theresa May accused her plans to leave the critical people of the European Union "playing politics" with the future of Britain and to harm the national interest in the newspaper Sunday Times.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain, Theresa May, will attend the Conservatory Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In the next interview, published after her photo on the first page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to breach her so-called "Brexit" plan that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs, and said it is "a total absurdity".
The killing of Wayde Sims police seized the suspect Dytheon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
The police seized a person suspected of shooting at the death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Ružo Police Department reported that 20 years ago, Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for murdering him.
The officials posted a video of the shock of Sims and Simpson, and the police mentioned that Simsa had left her eyes at the hospital.
The "CBS" branch "WAFB" reports that the police took the glasses from the scene and found Simpson DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had killed Wayde.
The lawyer informs that his release security is $350 000.
A preliminary report was issued on Friday by experts from East Baton Rose, which mentions that the cause of death is a head-to-head bullet.
The section is awarded to the Belize State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the people of the region who assisted in the investigation during which the suspect was arrested.
The director of LSU sports, Joe Alleva, thanked the region for its legal protection for the "crustability and enforcement of justice".
Simss was 20 years old.
1.98 meters of age the boy grew up in Baton Ruz, where his father Wayne also played a basketball LSU.
Last season, the young man averaged 5,6 points in the game and won a 2,6 reverberated ball.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "blowed" and "shocked".
"It's always thought about," Wade said.
Firefighting in a forested city in Mexico
From Popokateptel’s coal mine, the pines reached the southern Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans to keep away from the fire department when the activation of the crater was registered and 183 times the emissions of gas and gas were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was watching a lot of horrors and horrors.
The pictures in the social media show a thin layer of wood covered by car front glasses in the Mexican neighborhoods, e.g. Chochimilke.
Geophysics noted that 72 km to the morning of the city’s fire-fighting activity increased when, in September 2017, a 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico.
The fire department, named Don Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Prior to the vote on independence, the annual police have been involved with Catalan separatists.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protestors were in contact with the police for independence and thousands joined the opposition demonstrations in order to mention the first of Catalonia's opposition vote on the separation year.
The group of segregated separatists was covered with eggs and powder. It caused dark dust clouds in the streets, which are usually filled by tourists.
The police used sticks to stop the next day’s mosquitoes.
Within a few hours, the group for independence, singing "Immortal, unforgivable", met with Unionist protestors who called out, "Spain is alive!"
The local press reported that fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries suffered through protests.
The year after 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but which is condemned by the Catalan separatists in the region of independence, remains a major tension.
Most voters decided to become independent, but due to the majority of the vote, the number of voters who refused to separate was low.
According to the Catalan authorities, in recent years, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes by police throughout the region in an attempt to stop the vote in the polls.
On Friday night of the Independence Group, a camp was set up to prevent a demonstration by the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to change the route.
For 68 years, the electrician Narcissus Termesas, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said that he was no longer true about the prospect of Catalonia's independence.
"We survived one of the best moments last year.
I watched as the parents happily shout out to those who can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the fact that last December in the regional elections there was a vital and serious victory, the independence of Catalonia's parties was difficult to maintain this year when many of their most well-known leaders withdrew into a voluntary trial or are held and awaiting the trial for the role of the referendum and subsequently declared independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puigas, filmed a protest on his phone, said that the conflict had created politics on both sides.
"Employment is constantly growing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriolis Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned in the pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament's elections next year.
"Censorship in the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the lack of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government has shown," he said.

Mengo's hit ensures Livingston's victory 1:0 against Rangers
Livingston player Dolly Mengo's first draw guaranteed victory
On top of the league, Livingston was surprised by Rangers, forcing Steven Gerrard, the head of the Ibrox Club to lose the second of the 18 matches.
The impact of Dolly Mengos was very important because in the moment Gary Holto was compared to "Hibernian".
The Gerrard team will meet with the Hearts leaders during this Premier league season and will be leaving eight points on Sunday.
Earlier on Thursday, the European Games of the Rankers League in the House play with the Rapid One.
At the time, Livingston extended its unparalleled series of unparalleled games in the division to six, and the chief coach Holts had not yet experienced the taste of losing because Kenny Miller had only changed last month.
Livingston's opportunity to compete with static guests
Even before the collapse of Holto's team, due to its inability to solve the various problems of the Rangers, they had to be in front of them long ago.
At first, Scott Robinson slammed and hit the cut door, and then Alan Lithgow was unable to reach Craig Halket's head by the ball and this one was lying next to the door.
The landlords, allowing the Rangers to play in front, were not disappointed because they knew that they could cause trouble to the guests by creating standard situations.
That's the way it's been stolen.
The Rangers lost their freedom of strike and Livingston took the lead; Declan Gallagher and Robinson took the ball to Mengai, and he earned it from the middle of the courtroom.
Since then, the ball has been more controlled by Rangers, but the protection of the hosts has been ineffective and the user Liam Kelly has hardly been able to work.
Such a vague game continued in the second body, although Kelly had to work to prevent Alfredo Morelos from hitting the door.
Scott Pittman's son-in-law, Allan McGregor, fired the ball and, after another standard situation, the ball was sent to the front of the door by the Lithgow.
When the ball was delivered, it was constantly on the scene of the Livingstone penalty, but every time it was exhausted, and the two requirements for the penalty were one for meeting Halket with after the change site I ran into Glenn Middleton, and the other for the hand of the ball was not satisfied.
Analysis of the phenomenal appearance of Livingstone
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Macaroni arena
The Phenomenal "Livingston" game and result.
For all up to one they were great and continued to exceed expectations about the ever-increasing game.
The style of the game and the staff from the return to the highest level almost did not change, but the great prize is due to Holt, because when he arrived he set up the team.
He's had a lot of big men talking to him.
Captain Halkett was a great player in a well-organized defense, and Menga was worth Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall not to lose their alertness.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they play great, under Gerrard, they once lacked much in order to reach their level.
They had little to do with decisive attacks and only one time they had to fight for the defense of the hosts. A certain alarm call was made to the Rangers team in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Kelne was met in different ways
On Saturday (September 29th), there was a sky of chimpanzees and blue when Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's opposing visit to Germany when he was seeking to restore relations between NATO allies.
The leaders argued about problems such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open up a new giant match.
The largest Turkish population community outside Turkey has been established in the city.
The police banned 25 000 people from fighting in front of them for security, but many of them came to see their president.
These protestors against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also tried to hear Erdogan's policy condemn both the German government's decision to meet him in their country.
Different protests indicate the collapse of visitors: some German Turks consider it to be a giant, while others call it a dictator.

Long Lartino Prison. Six officers injured during the crash
The Prison Service reported that six prison officials were severely injured during the arrest of special security officers.
The incident took place in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Vusteršy on Sunday at 9.30 a.m. BVL, where it continues.
Special "Tornado" officers were put in charge of this strike involving eight prisoners and taking place in one prison wing.
Officials are treated from minor facial injuries at the site of the event.
The representative of the prison department said: “In order to manage the ongoing incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison staff were established.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are ensuring that responsible persons will be assigned to the police and, possibly, we will spend longer time than toys."
The HMP Long Lartin prison is held in more than 500 prisons, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that a prison manager was being treated in a hospital after he was attacked by a Kalinite.
In the past year, in October, the police were sent to prison to handle a serious crisis that some of the workers had suffered in billiards.
Hurricane Rosa with its sudden floods threatens Finland, Las Vegas, Solt Leik Sichi (it can be useful for the most remote areas)
It is not normal for the atrical depression to strike Arizona, but that is what is likely to happen next week when the hurricane of Rosa with her remaining energy will collapse in the south of the desert and this will result in a sudden flood risk.
The National Meteorology Service has already announced the observation of the sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona, floating south and east of Nevada, southern California and Juta, including Finland, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Solt Leave Site.
It is expected that on Monday, while approaching the rain, Rosa will head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday.
In Finland, the National Meteorological Service noted that only “ten atrical cyclones have maintained the status of atrical or atrical depression not more than 322 miles [322 km] from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an hurricane not more than 64 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre are forecast to reach a drop of 5 to 10 centimeters, while the drop rate of 5 centimeters in some areas of Arizona Mogolon Rimo will reach 5 centimeters.
Other areas of the south-west of the desert, including the central Mounts and the Great Basin, will likely range from 2.5 to 5 centimeters, and sometimes fall to 10 centimeters.
For people who do not experience sudden floods, the rains of Rose can be a blessing because the region is suffering from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of them may be useful because the afternoons are currently suffering from droughts.
According to U.S. drought monitoring centre data, a little more than 40% of Arizona suffers from very high drought, and this corresponds to the second highest category," said weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa travels across the coast across the California Peninsula, which belongs to Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still equivalent to the hurricane category of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of the Euchenian Bay (Mexico) and moves north 19 km at an hour’s speed.
Audra is experiencing colder waters in the Pacific region and is therefore serious.
So it is expected that it will reach the coast of Mexico with the atricle force on Monday afternoons or evenings.
The criteria that arise in certain parts of Mexico may be severe and may pose a high risk of flooding.
"From the California Peninsula to the North West, Sonora is expected to wait between 8 and 15 centimeters, but a possible thing – and up to 25 centimeters of dropout," said weather.com.
Then Roza will enter the north through Mexico as the atrical audre, then, Tuesday morning, reach the Arizona wall as the atrical depression, and the Tuesday late evening through Arizona will draw south of Juta.
"The main risk expected from Rose or its remains is a very high amount of rain in the California Peninsula, the North West Sonor and the South American Desert," the National Hurricane Centre reported.
These rains are believed to cause life - threatening sudden floods, droughts, and droughts in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsummer North. Take four people suspected of attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20 years of age were detained by a suspected attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the Midsummer North in the Excelsior terrace area, about 40.00 hours on Saturday according to the BVL.
He was taken to the hospital and is now stable.
The police of Eivono and Somerset reported that a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstok area at night.
The officials asked all the people who could have any material filmed on the mobile phone about what happened.
In short, Kavanaugh says that he was “enraged by the hostility and anger of the party of the Democrats”.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that we would like to reject the unforgivable and insulting tactics of the Democratic Party," Shortas said in his own language in Villing, West Virginia.
In short, Kavanaugh said that during his candidacy process, "democratic party was angry and angry".
Kavanaugh testified on Thursday to the congress firmly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were still a teenager.
Ford also testified at the Court's hearing on his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans saw on that day what Kavanaugh looks like, how good, and how brave.
– The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, that is a judge with a reliable reputation in the field of public services," he said the opinion of Western Virgin supporters.
The President indirectly recalled the Kavanaugh candidacy, together with the importance of the mid-election of republican elections.
"There have been five weeks of the best elections in our lives.
I don't participate, although I'm really involved," he said.
– That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
A short statement was made that the Democrats were trying to “oppress and obstruct”.
The senior GOP assistant CNN said that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place no later than Friday.
The number of deaths of these fish due to earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia continues to rise
The authorities reported that at least 384 people were killed, many were killed because of the huge wave of flooding on the beach, when strong earthquakes and tsunamis struck the islands of Indonesia.
On Friday, the people gathered at a beach festival in Palu, where a six - foot - high [6 m] wave began to flow into the coast. Most of them died and destroyed everything that happened on the road.
After the tsunami, a 7.5 - bullet earthquake occurred.
“When the tsunami threat came to light yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they became victims,” said BNPB, a press representative of the Indonesian disaster reduction agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, during the information report in Jakart.
“Cunamis did not recover by himself, he drove cars, roses, houses, he beat everything on the ground”, said Nugroho and added that, before hitting the coast, the tsunamis opened the sea at 800 km/h.
He said that some people went into the trees to avoid tsunamis and so survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photos of the crash agency from the air showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, abandoned and destroyed, and the pond was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the city of the North continued to be hit again.
The series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) reported that the energy released at the time of a particularly strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb, which was put on Hiroshima during World War II.
It was reported that the tsunamis were able to strengthen the city’s geographical location, as it stood at the end of a long, narrow valley.
Nugroho described the damage as “great” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
He said that some of the bodies of victims had been found trapped after the ruins of the buildings, later added that 540 people were injured, and 29 people died without knowledge.
Nugroho said that the number and damage of the victims may be greater beyond the coast, located 300 km north of Pala, in the area called Dongala, which is the nearest earthquake epicenter.
Negroho said that the communications networks “were completely paralyzed, so no information was received” from Dongal.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the representative of the Red Cross, adding that workers and volunteers go to disaster-affected areas.
It has been said that "they can already be seen as a tragedy, but the situation can be even worse."
On Saturday, the agency was highly criticised for not reporting that the tsunami struck Palu, although officials said that the waves had released a warning.
In the general social media, you can hear a man at the top of the building, calling for a nearby tsunami for people on the bottom of the street.
Within a few minutes to the edge, the water wall is breaking down, removing buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately approve the filmed material.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, electricity supply was disrupted and communications networks around Pala and authorities were difficult to coordinate aid delivery.
The authorities have reported that an army from Jakarta and other cities began to send cargo aircraft with aid supplies, but the evacuated person still needs the most necessary food and other necessities.
The city airport was reopened only to provide assistance and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit Palu's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
Dosebá reported that when World Vision staff from Dongal had safely travelled to the city of Palu, where the workers were sitting in the sanctuaries of the office building.
"They told me I saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the aid groups began taking difficult action to provide disaster relief, some people complained that those with a lot of experience in foreign aid had been banned from travelling to Paul.
Under Indonesia's regulations, funding, provision and staff employed abroad can only help when the disaster scene is announced in the national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
– When the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster," we can call for international aid, but this status has not yet been announced."
The second night after the earthquake on Friday and the tsunami, friends and close friends of the people believed that their loved ones would become a part of a miracle that would affect the nebula of the history of distress.
A small boy was taken out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been hanged for two days by her mother’s body.
A coach of the Indonesian national parasparing team, Gendon Subdono, had paid two grand Asian players who ended up in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others from Roa Roa's hotel, including Mandag, were his students.
"When I am older in parasparnia sports, I bear my emotional burden," he said.
Gendonas said a lot of things about Roa Roa’s hotel’s failure over a few hours, and this knowledge came after the parasparnia sports community. He volunteered to send messages using the WhatsApp program for the Palu contestants who participated in the beach festival.
However, his message contained only one gray, not two blue beads.
"I think this means that the messages were not received," he said.

Kanye West. Reperis changed his name to Ye
Reperis Kanye West changes its name to Ye.
On Saturday, when he announced the changes in Twitter, he wrote: “A person, previously known as Kanye West. ”
For 41 years, Mr West has been called Ye and on this behalf named the eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes began before the show "Saturday Night Live", where West was expected to present its new album "Yandhi".
This is what he has to change the artist Ariana Granda, who called off the event for "emotional reasons," said the show creator.
This is not only a reduction in the current professional name – Mr West said earlier that this word has religious significance to him.
"I think that "yes" is the word used most often in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said K. Wests earlier this year about the name of the album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, that means us.
It began from Kanye, which means the only one, and turns directly to Ye, which means our good, bad, familiar, all-time reflection.
The album reflects more on what we are."
He's one of many famous reperes who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he was given the lead in the name of Love and Brotherly Love.
A former colleague of Westo JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without him and his great letters.
Mexican politics Andrés Manuel López Obradar (short-term AMLO) promises not to use war against civilians.
The elected President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Adoradoras, promised never to use military forces against civilians, when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of cruel repression against students.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised at Tlatelolco "never use military forces to discourage the Mexicans".
On October 2, 1968, when the movements of the left students began in Latin America, military officials on the site shot at a peaceful demonstration, and 300 people were killed.
López Obrador made a strong promise to support young Mexicans each month by subsidising students and opening more free state universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities include young people in criminal groups.
The US should reinforce the financing of artificial intelligence
"When in the field of artificial intelligence, China is becoming increasingly active, the US should double the amount released for research in this field," says the investor and artificial intelligence specialist Kai-Fu Lee, working on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were received following the publication by the various authorities of the US Government of notifications of artificial intelligence, even the fact that the US is not in general an official strategy of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year – the goal of leading the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The enhanced budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the US and are expected in the field of other artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Improved funding could double the likelihood that another major achievement of artificial intelligence will be the USA, as Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "Sinovation Ventures" was released this month by Mr. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Director-General of the “Sinovation Ventures” who invested in one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face ++.
At the ninth decade of Carnegie Mellon, he worked with an artificial intelligence system that won the U.S. top-ranking game Othello, and later he was head of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch Google.
Lee recognized the previous US government's technology competitions, such as the "Robotics Challenge" Agency for Defence Advanced Research, and asked when to help find more insightful people.
Lee said U.S. scientists often have to work hard to win state grants.
"It is not China that attracts academic leaders – they are companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have dedicated their minds to working with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that the changes in immigration policy can also help the US strengthen efforts for artificial intelligence.
"I think that doctors working in the field of artificial intelligence should be offered green cards automatically," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published its new generation's artificial intelligence development plan.
In addition, Lee said that the Chinese National Science Fund is funded by academic institutions, like the National Science Fund and other government organisations, which allocates money to US scientists, but the academic quality of work in China is lower.
In the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has set up a Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to include partners from the industrial and academic community, and the Baltic Chambers have announced that a Special Committee of Artificial Intelligence will be set up.
This month DARPA (the Agency for Advanced Defence Research) has published some $2 billion investment for the AI Next initiative.
NSF is currently investing in artificial intelligence research over US$ 100 million a year.
However, in the coming months, nothing has been done about US legislation aimed at establishing the National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The Macedonians voted in the Sunday referendum on whether to change the name of the country by the name of the Republic of North Macedonia, this would be an action to resolve the ten-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in which the province of Macedonia is situated, claims that its name of the northern neighbour represents claims to the territory of Greece and veto Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments have agreed on the new name proposed in June, but the opposition nationalists claim that the name change would affect the ethnic identity of most Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanova said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts as to whether the voter's activity would reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to enter into force.
The question of a referendum on the ballot cards was put: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU in agreement with Greece?"
The sponsors of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that Macedonia, one of the countries that have broken up with Yugoslavia, is worth paying the price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the country's future, a young Macedonian to be able to live freely, to protect the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
While not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament said that they would respect the results of the vote and make them decisive.
The name is to be changed in Parliament by two-thirds of the majority.
The State Electoral Commission has reported that no infringement reports have been reported by 13 o'clock.
However, the voter's activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of the vote was cast.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe," said Gjos Tanevski, a 62-year-old collector in Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaevas, his wife Zorica and his son Duško are voting in a referendum held in Macedonia on the name of the country in order to open the way to NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
Prior to the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and pulled the seats in front of the tents, which he built as a boycotting referendum.
"We are outside NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not enter the door to the service," Kavadarkov said.
– We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can return to others, such as China and Russia, and participate in the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaevas said that NATO membership in Macedonia, with unemployment rates reaching more than 20 per cent, would attract the necessary investments.
"I hope that the vast majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are favourable to the EU and NATO," Zaevas said after giving his vote.
He said that the result of "Yes" would be "the assurance of our future".
According to the survey results published by the Macedonian Research Institute on Monday, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters should participate in the referendum – less than the electoral activity required.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonia's TV Telma, 57 percent of respondents are preparing for the Sunday vote.
Of these, 70 percent said that I would vote “Yes”.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it has to take part in 50 per cent of voters plus one vote.
If the referendum were not reached, it would have been the first serious failure of the pro-Court Government's policy since it took over power last May.
See: The Manchester City player Sergio Aguero overcomes the entire Brighton defense and profit gain
Sergio Aguero and Raheemas Sterling won the Brighton defense, and the Manchester City team won the match at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
Aguero's 65-minute ingestion seems unlikely to be easy.
The Argentine bomber got the ball in the middle of the square at the start of the attack.
Before going out into the open field, he walked between three Brighton defenders.
At that time, Aguero was surrounded by four green marchers.
He ran through one defender, before he had covered several others on the side of the Brightton Penitentiary.
Then he put the ball to the left where Sterling was.
The English gunman, in one blow from the courtroom, returned the ball to Aguero and this right leg shot the ball to the right side of the gate network, striking up Mathew Ryan, the owner of Brighton.
“Aguero has a problem with his feet,” magazine manager Pepas Guardiola told reporters.
– We talked about him playing 55 to 60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were lucky that he earned a fortune at that moment."
However, it was Sterling that helped the first Sky Blues to move forward in these Premier League matches.
The profit of the profit was 29 minutes.
During that attack, Aguero received a ball at the bottom of Brighton.
On the left side of the area between the two opponents, he kindly transferred the ball to Leroy’s Sane.
In Sane, several spies pushed the ball forward until Sterling was engaged to the further vertebrate.
The Sky Blues shooter launched the ball at the door before even going from the edge of the platform.
On Tuesday, at 1255 hours, "City" meets with the "Hoffenheim" League of Champions at the Rhein-Neckar (Germany) arena.
Sherzer wants to play friendly games with Rockies
After "Nationals" disappeared from the failed competitions, there was no need to force for new important reasons.
In a competitive way, Scherzer expects to win Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still has the opportunity to remain in the competitions; in the national league "West" they run one point "Los Angeles Dodgers".
“Rockies”, score 5:2 won by “Nationals” on Friday evening, at least already secured the chance to get a preferential ticket, but will still have to strive to ensure the right to play the first division.
"Although we are playing for nothing, at least we will be able to escape to the ground knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where people and other teams are gathered, will probably be at the highest level we can reach this year.
Why don't you get sick?"
The Sunday team of the Nationals launch team has not yet announced, but in this case they throw the ball is clearly willing to release Sherzer.
Sherzer, who will be in the building of this competition on the 34th day of the year, took the position of the theatre on a regular holiday on a Sunday.

A Short Language in West Virginia
Speaking of the important activity of the voters of Republicans in the mid-term elections, the President shall report indirectly on the situation regarding the appointment of Bretto Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
"All that we have achieved will be placed on the table in November.
Five weeks have passed since the most important elections in our lives.
It's very important, I'm not running... but I'm really running, that's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Next: – You see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see how this is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means, you see how low it is, how evil it is.
They don't care what they've done, what they've been through to get power and control; here's what they really want, power and control, but we won't do it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have the mission "to resist and to hinder".
"And you see it for the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "slow, terrible, earthly, and wrong people."
He referred to the Senate Courts Committee, referring to the name of Democratic Senator Diane ‘s Feinstein’, which resulted in the great ovation of listeners.
‘Do you remember her answer?
Did you delete the document?
Uh, um, like.
No, um... no, I'm waiting for one – it was really a loose body language – the worst body language of all I've ever seen."
Leborists have lost a variety of views.
They do not tolerate those who openly express their opinion
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted for my disbelief, tell me if it was necessary to monitor it.
Finally, I am the latest of the Lebanese parliamentarians who have been told that I am unwelcome – and this is for my opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, called for similar corrections because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
My disbelief was expressed in criticizing me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economic policy, for national security, for Europe, for ironically, for similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The report on the Thursday of the Nottingham East Labour meeting stated that "we want many members to be involved and that meetings are productive."
Most of the eight years since I was a local MP of the Libyan Party, the GC's meetings on Friday evening were exactly the same.
It is sad that today's many tons of meetings are not so much the "slower, more pleasant" policy promises to be forgotten long ago, even if it has been started in general.
It is increasingly clear that another opinion is not tolerated in the Lebanese party and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is accepted by the party’s management.
This began shortly after the party leader, Jeremy, and colleagues, whom I had previously believed to be similar, began to expect that I would turn 180 degrees and follow the opinions I would never agree with, either on national security or on the EU single market.
As soon as I speak to the public – and even no matter what – social networks are dealing with violations that encourage my withdrawal, they condemn the policy of the centre and say that I am not a place in the Leiborist party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I have achieved something far more than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are political.
I am playing professionally and firmly on the part of my colleagues who have to keep up with each day's sexist and racist insults.
One of the most disturbing things in this political era is how the offenses have become a normal sign.
Jeremy Corbyna said last week that the Leiborist party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a party of the same views, and with each "untrusted" procedure or an amendment to the electoral system, this party is becoming less and less.
Over the past two years, I have waited for many advice not to be so loud, and then “everything will be fine. ”
But I didn't come to politics.
Since I joined the Leiborist Party 32 years ago, I have been a scientist who has been challenged by thatcher's government's neglect, which, in the real sense, has damaged my entire school class, and I have sought to obtain better public services for those who need them most – whether they are a local council member or a minister of the government.
I have never concealed my policies, including the recent elections.
No one in the Nottingham East had to be surprised by my political opinions and disagreement with the current leaders.
To those who have promoted this procedure on Friday, I can say that when the country gets to Brexit, from which households, businesses and public services are affected, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Lebanese Party.
But in fact, one message I have for my voters, for Members of the Leiborist Party (or not): I am delighted to be able to serve you and promise you that no threats of revocation or political certainty will prevent me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and your best interests.

"Ayr"- "Melrose" – 38:17 "Ayr" does not operate on top of tables
Two late tests have failed the final results, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" has won this triumphal moment in the impressive games of Tennet's Premiership.
Now the team appeared at the top of the table – the only one not affected.
Finally, by winning, they have brought unparalleled defense and well-used opportunities, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
"We've had all the trials in all the games that have been going on so far, and we're still not working, so I'm really happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "Ayr" turned out well, players took advantage of their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson’s 14th-minute trial, which resulted in Frazier Climo, led Air to the front, but the yellow card for Rory Hughes, who was released on the site by Warriors, allowed Melrose to collect the numbers, and Baggot stopped the unsuccessful attempt.
Climo increased the advantage of Air when before, in the middle of the race, he earned points and successfully completed his personal test by helping Air before the break-off of result 17:5.
However, the second generation of Melrose began unfavourable, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt, which resulted in the completion of Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
The matches were suspended for a longer time because Ruaridh Knottas suffered severe trauma and was removed from the window on the innocent. Following the match "Ayr" continued to work forward when Stafford McDowall's trial ended successfully with Clima.
"Ayr" Captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and Melrose tried to use the player's surplus, but Bruce's Colvine's test was unrelenting after the end of the free pressure.
The home team player came back, but when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Clima without a ball, MacPherson from the line of the fine pressed the ball for the seats of the remaining "Ayr" thunderstorms.
Climo's results completed his test, as had been done since almost the beginning of the match update, after Kyle's Rowe held David Armstrong's spirit on the platform and stopped the country's fighter Gregor Henry from holding the fifth round of the house team to win points.
Still Game star, apparently, ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
The Still Game star Fordas Kieranan appears to be ready to move to the accommodation and catering services sector after it has shown that the director of the licensed restaurant company has been appointed.
A 56-year-old man in a popular BBC comedy plays Jack Jarvis, writes scenarios and plays together with his comic partner Greg Hemphyll.
The duet announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last season of this season, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Kraiglango.
Officially, he became Director of the Affiliates Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this fact, although the sources of Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernana was looking for ways to get into the glazgo "scattering restaurant business".
"We belong to the sea": Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the water
The sailors are patrolling the seaport in La Pase.
The flag of the watermelon is floating on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the seabed is filled with a shout: “We are legally dependent on the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
In all of Bolivia’s land-locked memories of the access to the water that we had to sacrifice to Chile in the 19th century in the bloody conflict of the stockpiles — living and long enough to be in the Pacific again.
In recent decades, the hopes of the anointed have been greatly strengthened, as after five years of discussion, Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice decision, which will be published on 1 October.
"Bolivia is united by the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, wants to see positive results," said Bolivia's diplomat Robert Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens will monitor the publication of the TTT decision throughout the country on large screens, hoping that the Hague Court will take a positive decision on Bolivia’s complaint – Chile will be obliged to negotiate on Bolivia’s state of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who is awaiting a controversial electoral struggle for re-election, is also very interested as soon as the decision on Monday ends.
"We are very close to the opportunity to return to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, would like to believe that it is unlikely that the court will take a decision in favour of Bolivia, even if it would take little change.
The United Nations institution established in the Netherlands shall not be able to detect the territory of Chile and shall indicate that the outcome of the negotiations is not to be determined.
The fact that the TTT decision will be published only six months after the last arguments were heard, hardly or shows that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, expert in international law in Chile.
And even if Bolivia managed to make a move, the past four years may have left her paralyzed.
"This issue of access to the sea has been raised illegally by the current Bolivian administration," Zárat said.
She believes that any remnant of Chile’s good will has destroyed the crossroads of Morales’ rhetoric.
Bolivia and Chile will be very difficult to discuss after a conversation.
The country has not changed its ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's decision had been taken unusually quickly.
"In the spring, Bolivia will have a unique opportunity to start new relations with Chile and to end the 139-year-old disagreements for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, and uses the maritime issue as a political manipulation.
"Bolivia will never promise to have the right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must agree with the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho believes that his people will never return to nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises, which led to the agreement of the leaders of the competing countries during the Singapore meeting.
His comments were made at the time when the Secretary of State, Mr Pompey, said that he intended to renew the tight nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after he met with Kim Jong Unu in Singapore.
Ri says that the Utopian dream is that the continuation of sanctions and the United States of America, by rejecting the declaration of the end of the Korean War, could ever be halted.
Washington is prevented from accepting the declaration if, in the first place, the Pchenjana will not do any credible disarmament action.
And Kim and US President Donald Short wants to hold a second meeting.
But the widespread skepticism that Chechen is not seriously going to reject the arsenal that the country seems to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompey intends to visit Pchenjane next month to prepare the soil for the second Kim and Short meeting.
The Paris fashion show was revealed that the latest trend is massive head coverings, and they quickly shut down the nearest fashion shop
If you want to add your flight collection or completely protect from the sun, this trend is just for you.
The designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented a wide range of eccentricly large head coverings in their 2019 spring and summer collections, and he simply painted the views of Paris's fashion week.
These particularly non-practical flights closed the social network "Instagram" this summer, and these designers presented eye-catching works on the podium.
The distinctive design of Valentino was a huge body color fly, carved with a wide, feathered head on the head of the manikin.
Other non-standard-size accessories were expensive orbs, beads and even ananas — but they were not designed to protect your head from cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a beautiful collection of hats – at the same time to Halloween.
Many colourful masks were felt in lips and reminded Hannibal Lecter more than the high fashion.
One of the works looked like a member’s costume, with a tube and a underwater glasses, and another remembered the soluble ice pot.
And if you're having this huge fashion trend, don't ask.
Stylish experts believe that these large envelopes can be found in shops.
The great flights were also popular with the La Bomba high-ends, and the two-legged flights had already been carried by all – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand of the goods, which created extremely impractical flights that prevented all social networks, released on the podium another great piece of work – a nuclear tank of beach, almost the same size as the one carrying it with a washing suit.
Red-brown striped strips, rubbed with strips and white leather sleeves, became the exclusive focus of the Jacquemus collection "La Riviera SS19" in Paris's fashion week.
The music designer Luke Armitage, FEMAIL, said: “I think that the next summer will bring big air and beach bags to the shops, because the designer has had such an impact, so it would be difficult to ignore the need for non-standard accessories.”
John Edward: “The payment of gifts is a very important asset for the world’s citizens”
Independent schools in Scotland improved the record of academic achievements in 2018 and demonstrated the exceptional results of examinations, which only further enhanced individual and collective achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other community merits.
When more than 30,000 students are taught throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), aim to provide their students and their parents with the highest level of services.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and to be citizens of the world.
Working in the education sector, which can create and implement the school programme, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and that they are being collected in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If it is possible to speak to a person, he will understand you.
If thou shalt speak with him of his own mouth, thou shalt speak unto his heart.
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to mix with people from other countries and build trust.
According to the results of this year's recent examinations, languages are excellent at the top of popularity and in independent schools are known as the best maintenance rankings.
A total of 68% of foreigners received the highest A score.
The data collected from 74 schools that are members of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A assessment during the Mandarin language exam, the highest A assessment received 72 percent of German-learned students, and the highest A assessment received 69 percent of French-speaking students, and 63 percent of Spanish-speaking students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland have time to pay foreign languages with essential skills, which children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages such as the subject, now independent school programmes and elsewhere are considered as important as basic things (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
According to a survey carried out by the UK Employment and Capacity Commission in 2014, 17% of the labour force had insufficient language skills for all reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill their jobs.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory for young people to prepare for their future careers.
As employment in the future will depend heavily on languages, these skills become essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person chooses to pursue in a second language, he will be much more beneficial in the future if he has the skills he needs all his life.
When you are able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person learning a language will be much more competitive.
According to a survey conducted in 2013, involving more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent of the people in the foreign language were unable to speak well enough to participate in the conversation, and the French language was the only language spoken by a double percentage of people, i.e. 15 percent.
That is why investing in language training is important for children today.
In a number of languages, especially in developing countries, children will have a better chance of meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school varies according to the language taught.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while other languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom are taught in view of the future of 2020, such as mandarins or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests are, there will always be many languages from which you can choose from in an independent school with training staff and specialists in this area.
Scotland’s independent schools are ready to develop a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to live in the future.
In today's world business environment, languages remain a vital part of the country's future, and that is why it is necessary to reflect on the education system.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity to choose, variety and results for Scotland’s youth.
It is necessary to do so.

LeBron's Sunday San Diego launches the debut "Lakers"
There was little waiting for the fans to see LeBron James start the Los Angeles Lakes season.
Lakers coach Luke Walton reported that James is playing in the opening of the Sunday season with Denver's "Nuggets" San Diego.
But for just a few minutes, I'm not clear yet.
"This will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
"Lakers" reporter Mike`s Trudella's Twitter account said that James is likely to play a limited time.
As early as this week, James was asked about plans in the Lakers team during six pre-season games.
"At this stage of my career, I no longer need pre-season matches to prepare," he said.
Short language in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Short this evening starts his campaign in Ville, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned short-tongues next week, including suspensions in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Following the approval of the suspension procedure for the candidate of the Supreme Court elected by him, Shorta is seeking to focus support in the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republics have been threatened by the loss of control in the Congress in November.
A few hours later, this evening, we're going to have a short speech in West Virginia, and how can we monitor her online?
Short language in Vilinge, West Virginia, scheduled 19 hours in the morning evening, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the short language in Western Virginia in the following online translation "YouTube".
The topic of the Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh will soon face this week because it has suffered a lot of tensions over suspicion of improper sexual behaviour, when the Senate voted for the suspension of the candidate until the week of the FTB's investigation.
But the main objective of this campaign is to help the Republics acquire some strength in the coming November elections.
Therefore, representatives of President Trump's campaign say that the purpose of these five meetings next week, as Reuters is announced, is to "energy volunteers and supporters, trying to defend and expand the majority of the republics held in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"Congress control is so important in its agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible, because the campaign season is beginning very hot," said the representative of the Trump campaign, reluctant to reveal his name.
The "Vilingo Wesbanco" arena should attract sponsors from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract Pittsberg's media attention," says Western Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Shortas will visit Western Virginia, the country where more than 40 percentage points were won in 2016.
A short attempt is being made to help the Western Virginia candidate to the Senate, the Republic of Patrick Morrisey, who is in the field of rankings according to surveys.
"It's not a good sign to Morrisey that the president had to come to get him to the top of the rankings," said Simon Haederis, a politician at the University of West Virginia, as Reuters reports.
2018 Ryder Cup Tournament: The US team has launched a race and is hoping to join the competitions of Sunday units.
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon, Thursdays can be just what was needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a fluctuation of success is totally ingenious, but players really believe it, especially in such competitions as this.
So there's success on the side of the chain now?
"They led six points, and now four, so I guess we can keep it this way," Jordan Spiethas said, preparing for the day.
Of course, Europe is the first one, has a four-point advantage, and is still waiting for twelve matches.
American enthusiasm, says Spietho, has grown, and they don't miss it, no longer talking about the shape of Spietho and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them collected three points of four.
The pressure was unaffected from the beginning to the end and led unrelentingly.
In order to finish the fourth match, Thomas earned two points from two possibilities.
His blow, having won them in the 15th duo of this match, was followed by similar whispers that seem to say the end of the American team is not yet coming.
"You just need to concentrate and take care of your own games," Spiethas said.
Now each of these players has been played separately.
Until successful completion, 18 pieces of data.
The only players who have collected more points for Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, which is the unmistakable history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but wonderful couple from Europe gathered four points from four possibilities and can be quiet.
Moliwood was the only couple who needed extra blows not only on Saturday afternoons, but also on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and Friday mornings.
The way in which these events and the happy viewers react only confirms that they will be the players who win the weekend, and no one else will be able to achieve a popularity such as Fleetwood or Molinaru, who, after the last setting of Le Golf National, have a chance to secure a European victory.
It would be good to reach both of them at the same time.
Although we are talking about European praise in the early days.
Bubba Watson and Webbas Simpson played briefly with Sergio Garcia, a four-ball game in the morning when he was confronted with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two additional hits during the first nine series caused Spanish and Swedish to the trouble from which they were unable to escape.
But no one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
Four balls and four cats are so interesting to observe because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give and which they do not give, and because the strategy can change more quickly.
Europe has played better as a team, so it has come to the final with a strong lead, but this fourth stage has shown that the US team has a battleship that some, especially in the countries, have doubted.
The last day of the “Ryder” Cup Competitions Europe is the first 10:6
Europe's last day of the Ryder Cup will be faced with a significant change, after the Saturday's fourth stage, leading towards the United States result 10:6.
Incentived by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario, the dute continued to change the atmosphere by winning two victories against the heavily combating Tiger Woods and took the lead in the four points of Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, in order to preserve the trophies lost by Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the fourth game tomorrow against the failed American side and the stage ended with 3:1.
The U.S. demonstrated more resistance in the four players who won two cats, but failed to overcome the point-by-point overpowering
Jim Furyko's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12-unit match to keep the trophies in his hands.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four points in a row, when Molinari and Molliwood doubled after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second couple who won four points during their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup competitions.
With the influence of Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourties, they were unrelentingly disturbed by the lack of confidence in Woods and the American novelty of Bryson Dechambeu by 5:4.
Woods, who was not so affected by two Saturdays’ matches, at some times showed a high level of professionalism, but had already lost 19 and 29 in their fours, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose fell in the morning and went back to play with partner Henrik Stenson in the fourth; they won 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third places in the world rankings.
In spite of the pleasant, gentle day of the wind in the southwestern part of Paris, not everything went to Europe like a candle.
Three times the winner Jordan Spiethes and Justin Thomas set up a card for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
Four football matches they won an unfavourable victory by 2:1 against John Rahm and Ian Poulter, and the fourth match hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy’s score of 4:3 without hitting the ball into two first pieces.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup team managed to regain the weight of the four points in a single match, although the Furyk side was caught up in the same way to keep the trophies.
Although two days were in the second place, on Sunday the success of them was apparent.
North Korea says it won't be armed unilaterally without confidence
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that the continued sanctions would exacerbate their lack of confidence in the United States and that, in such circumstances, the country would not really unilaterally withdraw nuclear weapons.
The Ri Yong Ho World Organisation told the General Assembly that in recent years North Korea has taken "significant good will measures", for example, halted nuclear missile testing, dismantled the nuclear test base and committed itself not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
"But we have not received a similar response from the US," he regretted.
"Without any confidence in the US, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to fight unilaterally."
Until the time when Ri heard North Korea’s complaints about Washington’s gradual approach to nuclear decommissioning, according to which North Koreans would be rewarded at its stages of action, his statement was divided by the fact that he totally rejected the idea of bilateral decommissioning, as Pchenjana had done earlier.
Ri recalled the joint statement submitted by Kim Jong Unas and Donald Shortas during the first meeting of the President of the United States and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to working on the Korean side's half-defence, and the Short promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean war from 1950 to 1953, but the United States says that the Pchenjan must first reject its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to mitigate the severe international sanctions imposed by North Koreans.
"The US requires nuclear disarmament first and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its objective by means of forced-out methods, even by rejecting declarations of the end of the war," Ri said.
“The idea that we can be sidetracked by sanctions is the same as that of people we don’t care about to observe utopian dreams.
But the problem is that the remaining sanctions are improving our untrustworthyness."
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim and Short meeting, which the US leader in the United Nations stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings of the leader of Kim and South Korea, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months: "If another country had been in South Korea on this nuclear disarmament issue and not the United States, the issue of semi-nuclear disarmament in Korea would not have been accepted by such an aligita."
However, Ri's tone of speech has changed dramatically compared to last year when he told the UN General Assembly that when "Mr. Blogo President" Shortas called Kim "Rakettes Lord", a self-defense mission, sending the North Korean missile to the United States was totally inevitable.
This year in the United Nations, a short time ago, which threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, fought for the courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much still needed to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea meets nuclear disarmament requirements.
On Wednesday, Shortas said that there was no time schedule for this, and said that “if this is necessary for two years, three years or five months, it is not important.”
China and Russia claimed that the UN Security Council should pay tribute to Chechen for its actions.
On Thursday, however, the Secretary of State of the United States of America said to the Security Council that "the sanctions of the Security Council must be strictly continued without any delay until a complete final demonstration of nuclear disarmament has been carried out."
The Security Council has supported the sanctions of North Korea since 2006, with a view to preventing the financing of the Pchenjan nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri U.S. General Assembly and later said he would visit Pchenjane again next month to clean up the ground for another meeting.
Pompeii North Korea has already visited three times this year, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pchenjan in July, saying that all the progress was just for North Korea to announce after a few hours that he had submitted "gangsterous requirements".
North Korea, during a meeting with Moon this month, promised to dismantle the missile base and nuclear complex if the United States would take the appropriate measures.
According to him, Kim said that those "relevant measures", which he was pursuing, are security guarantees that the short winner of Singapore, and will seek to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough to enjoy
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all its students to sleep more in order to combat growing cat culture in studies using caffeine and not sleeping at night
One academic found that in the world’s best university students often have no basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Čeisler, Harvard Medical School’s professor of sleep medicine and Brigam Sichi, a female hospital specialist, prepared a course that, he says, is the first such type of U.S.A.
The encouragement to prepare this course was presented to him after speaking about the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
"At the end of the talk, one girl came to me and said, "Why do I have to say this just now, in the last years of my studies?"
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleep, and it surprised me," he said "The Telegraph".
The course is proposed this year for the first time. It explains to the students how the most important quality sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results, to improve the common sense.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director Paul Barreira said that the university decided to offer this course when it became clear that the students had very little sleep during the week.
The hourly course includes an interactive series of tasks.
One section contains a photo of the bedroom where students can launch a cup of coffee, snacks, coaches and books and thus learn about the effect of caffeine, light effects on sleep, the impact of the lack of sleep on sports results and the importance of going to sleep during the course.
In the next section, participants learned how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Student city map with interactive pictograms that encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
"We understand that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the consequences of health when you choose to smoke," explained Professor Cheisler.
The culture of impatience does not sleep at night, says he still exists. Modern technologies and increasing pressure on students have led to the problem of growing sleep deprivation.
"Make sure that enough and quality sleep should be the secret weapon of the students in combating stress, persecution and anxiety, "He spoke, even avoiding weight gain, because the lack of sleep shifts the brain to the feeding regime, so the students constantly feel hungry."
Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chéisler to prepare a course when last night, the first of his years in Harvard, attended one of his subjects.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course available to the entire student city.
He wishes that the next step will be to invite all second-level students to listen to this course before starting to visit this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students determine the time to go to sleep, as well as travelling, and to protect the harmful effects of blue light, which is released by electronic devices and lighting of light diodes, as they may lose your circular rhythm out of balance, so it may be difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1:0 "Rangers": Men's inflamed Gerrard's men
"Rangers" experienced another disappointment when Dolly Mengai Livingstone was able to overcome the depressed result of Steven Gerrard's 1:0.
"Ibrox" hoped to win his first victory after the victory of February 4:1 "St Johnstone", but Gary Holto's team won Gerard for the second time during the 18th race leader's post and now the last team has already left eight points from the far-off leader "Hearts".
Menga entered the rest of the seven minutes before the break, but without inspiration the players "Rangers" did not see the opportunity to compare the result.
The Rangers have now fallen to the sixth place, Livingston has risen to the third, and the Hibernian is left with only one intruder.
And the concerns of the Rangers do not end because it is likely that the tribune butter thing was applied to the head of the side judge Calumi Spencu and damaged him.
Gerrard made four changes, which allowed to wrap Air and lead to the Betfred cup semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt trusted the same uniforms that took the point from Hearts last week, and he would have trusted him as his well-thought alliances brought up opponents in each step.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but with it, Livingston did more.
They could have been caught for the second minute, when Menga shot close to the ball towards Allano McGregor's door to run to Scott Pittman, but he lost his chance to turn the ball away from the door.
After the far-off battle of Keaghano Jacobs, Captain Craig Halket reached, but his colonel, Alan Lithgow, asked for a country.
"Rangers" took control, but the last third of the matches were only hope, not belief in their game.
Five more minutes later, Alfred Morelos won me a fine when he met Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson took his hand with the Colombian complaints.
Ranger's first body was able to hit only twice, but the former Ibrox user, Liam Kelly, or caused Lassana Coulibally's headache or mild swelling of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's 34-minute adventure may not match the race, no one will argue that they have already earned it for their efforts.
"Rangers" and again failed to overcome the false defenses of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield wasn't worried when Declan Gallagher transferred the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his own name and handed it over to Menga for easy completion.
During the break, Gerrard took action to replace Coulibally to Ryan Kent and that change almost immediately gave fruit when the country's security defeated Morelos, but after a spectacular defeat, Kelly recovered the blow.
Livingston included guests in such a game as they loved – with the further transfers of the Litgowo and Halket ball.
At the end of Holto's team was able to increase their perversion, but McGregors recovered from Jacob's beating after the Lithuanian surrender.
After moving to the square, the player named "Rangers" Glenn Middleton called again at the end of the match because of the fine after meeting Jacobs, but Thomson and again ignored him.
German: Developer of the Geiger numerator
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years ago and DAUGIAU... That day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born in Germany.
Geigeris discovered a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention, by which the device was later created, is known as Geigeri's numerator.
Since then, this device has become the world's scientific hit, and later the popular cultural hit, when in the 1950s Bells of Coronado film, researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who are not particularly fond of the cubes:
The man: “Who the hell is this? ”
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s numerator that is used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When these ears are closed, you can actually hear how atoms work, release the radioactive effect in minerals."
Evans: "Hey, that's a real shot now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, after only a few days before the 63rd birthday.
But the invention of his name continues to live on.

The method includes the removal of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory
The cells can then "see" proteins characterised by many forms of cancer and re-injected
The test vaccine has produced many promising results in the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.
One woman treated with this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, is diagnosed with egg cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immune cells from the patient and their metabolism in the laboratory, then cells can see proteins characterised by HER2 cancers and are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results allow us to believe that we have a very promising vaccine."
“HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, eggs, lungs and direct intestines”, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach when immune cells are derived from patients and are taught to be placed in cancer cells has been successfully adapted to the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye-West launched a triad that supported the Trump by putting on the MAGA kepurate after its appearance with the SNL show.
I'm glad it didn't end.
Following the presentation of the Saturday Night Live study, viewers praised Kanye West, who praised US President Donald Trump, who said he would participate in the 2020 campaign.
That evening, after performing the third song "Ghost Town", which wore a hat with the label "Make America Great", he continued to condemn the Democrats and expressed support for Trump.
"How many times have I had to talk to the whites, they say, 'How can you trust the Short as he's a racist?'
Well, if racism were to bother me, I'd be out of America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL show began with a comical scene in which Matt Damon made fun of the Senate's Bretto Kavanau Courts' Committee on Inadequate Sexual Offences, presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this was not broadcast, filmed material with West replicas into social networks was introduced by the comicist Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock was trying to get rid of West on this record.
In addition, Westas complained to the audience that the procurators had trouble with his head covering.
"They were looking after me in the back.
He said not to go there with such a hat.
They were looking out for me!
They said I reached the bottom," he said, "Washington Examiner".
Wests continued: “Do you want to see what the ass is? ” he asked. “ My Father has a superior crown, and this means that you cannot tell me what to do.
Start to love."
His statements were made at least twice in the auditorium of unrestrained frauds, and members of the SNL broadcasts appeared to have been injured, as Variety reports. One man asked the media: “The entire study has brought about a deathless silence.”
West was invited to change the singer to Ariana Grande, because her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller died a few days ago.
Wests was amazed by his appearance, during which he performed the song “I Love It”, wearing the Perrier bottle suit.
He received support from the conservative leader of the TPUSA Candace Turner, who published a record in the Twitter section: “One of the bravest spirits for a man: I HAVE BENEFITED MINISTERS.”
But the interview led by Karen Hunter on Twitter reported that West was just "self-made and this is extremely wonderful".
"But I choose NEREMTI man (by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his "art"), whose beliefs are a sad ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we're also free," she added.
Before the show starts, the rapper on Twitter announced that the name has changed and that the formals are now known as Kanye West.
He's not the first creator to change his name, but he went the same way as did Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Comrade Ripper Snoop Dogges originally called Snoop Lions; the music legend Prince has changed his name to a symbol and later became known as Prince.

According to the police, this incident occurred in Balihakamore.
The defendant is expected to stand before the judge of Belfast on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed.
The Star of the "Sost Wars" Next Harington criticises the distorted view of manhood
The next Harington was the character of John Snau HBO in a fantastic series of adventures about the Middle Ages of the World Wars.
But the 31-year-old actor criticises the cat's great-grandfather stereotype. He says that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel like they should be tough to be respected.
Speaking of Sunday Times Culture, another said that he thought "something is wrong", and raised a question about how to combat the problem of distorted manhood in #MeToo era.
Another, who recently led a 31 - year - old colleague named Rose Leslie, who was the star of the Soviet War, admitted that this theme “has left him very much. ”
"I feel that I feel strongly about this issue now. Where did we make a mistake in manhood?" he asked.
"What do we teach grown men to face such problems?"
Another believes that partly because of this distorted wave of manhood, television could be responsible for its creation of a very male character.
He continued: “What is born again, and what is taught?
What is taught on television or on the street so that young people will be convinced that such a type of discipline is needed?
I think this is one of the important issues of our time: how can we change it?
Clearly, we made a mistake somewhere with young men."
He also confirmed in the interview that he would not participate in any of the prehistoric or continuations of the "Sosti Wars" when the next summer series ends, and said that "he already has enough fields and horses."
Since November, the next film by Samo Shepard in the modern version of "True West". It's a film about the film director and his brother.
The actor recently revealed the best thing he'd ever seen in the creation of the "Sosts Wars", where he met his wife, Rose.
"In this series I met my wife, so in this sense the series gave me a future family and a future life," he said.
The "Emmy" award won in the fantastic series Rose played Igrit, the object of the other character John Snowe's love.
The couple married June 2018 in the property of Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14 % in new cases of disease
China reports a 14 % increase in HIV and AIDS infection among citizens.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 people were infected in the country.
Only 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new infected people were sexually transmitted, and this differs from previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV infection in some parts of China is rapidly spreading due to infectious blood transfusions.
But this reduced the number of people infected with HIV by almost zero Õ indicated the representatives of the Chinese health authorities during the conference in the province of Junan.
Over time, however, HIV infection and the number of people living with AIDS increased to 100,000 in China.
The transmission of HIV by sex is a major issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
As conservative values prevail in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men are ultimately women.
Most of these cases of infection occur due to inadequate protection measures over such sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised global access to HIV medicines as one of the ways to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees have leaked data from the Senate of Republicans, condemning "dangerous art" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, the U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied the suspicion that one of its employees published personal information from three U.S. senators on Wikipedia's pages.
Los Angeles Democrat believed that the charges had been filed by ultra-right wing experts and websites.
"Malas, melas and again no melas," said Waters in his Twitter account.
It is reported that there were also the addresses of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcho, both from Juta, home and telephone numbers.
The information on the Internet appeared on Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from the Capitol Valley at the time when the Senate was accused of improper sexual behaviour to the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanauhu.
The missing information appeared as soon as the three senators asked Kavanauhu questions.
“Conservatories’ websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address, which identified the source of these records related to the Waters office, was disclosed to the Waters staff member,” is reported from the Capitol.
"These baseless suspicions are completely false and absolute melas," continued Waters.
‘A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these misleading and uncertain suspicions is in no way responsible for the destruction of this information.
These unjustified suspicions are completely uncertain and absolute lies."
Water's statement quickly caught up with criticism on the Internet, as well as from the previous press representative of the White House, Ari Flescheri.
"This hatred sounds bad," Flescheris wrote.
"It says that it does not have the right to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of things that he has not done, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't fight.
He should not doubt the guilty’s motives.
He should be calm and humble."
It seems that Fleischeris tried to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of having seemed too bad at the Thursday meeting.
Republican candidate Omara Navarro, participating in the mid-term election campaign to change Waters, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"True, if you don't lie," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters stated that its office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false accusations.
"We will make sure that the organizers will explain, "It has continued, "that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all without exception to my staff."
A review of the comedy "Jonis Ingleša again" – an exciting show with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for Brexit in any British film. The same is true, it can be said, of course, about the restoration of the "John English" French comedy – "John English" was started to show again in 2003, and in 2011 he returned to the screens with the "John English Rise".
Will this sarcastic self-satisfaction, as we have clearly achieved, become a new option for national exports?
In any case, the incompetent John English with wide eyes and rubber face has the second opportunity to go up to the unmistakable truth of the surface since the very name clearly indicates that this comedy is designed for non-English-speaking cinematograph regions.
Of course, this blind secret agent, who, although he has claims to enjoy, gained and a few of the Inspector Clouseau's qualities, a little of the characteristics of Mr. Byno's character and background similarity to that man, is wondering what was used to create the drama "Fire Transport" for the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
It is also a little based on a character about a traveler and a secret man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV advertisement.
In this latest John English film, there are a few beautiful moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing a medium - sized suit and scarf, and the art rotor came into his helmet.
The comical talent of Atkinson is obvious, but the same humour appears to be exhaled and strangely exaggerated, especially when serious film branding, such as 007 and "Mission impossible", boldly inserts the elements of the comedy.
Humor is as much as it would be for children rather than adults, and I don't believe Johnny English's adventures seem to be as inventive and pure as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Byne.
Today’s most common theme is the fact that Britain was in serious trouble.
The cybernetic hack successfully entered the British highly secret web and exposed the identities of all of this area's British taps, which is causing the agent's touch – the role of Kevin Eldon is too insignificant.
This is the last drop on the President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers, the Pompastic and the Anglican People's Cup, which is already suffering from the devastating political impatience: Emma Thompson from Teresa May prints everything he can, but in the scenario, good material is a little bit.
Wise advisers inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to look for people among those who have retired.
This means that you're going to have to go to John English, who is currently working at a school director in a law firm, but who provides illegal lessons as to how to work as a secret agent. Here were some good jokes when English offered a School of Rock.
The English is sent back to Vihihol to discuss the unusual situation and there agrees for a long time on his own Bough, again known as Ben Miller.
Bough is already married to the captain of the submarine, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays a high-level girl, seems to be under-exploited.
Thus, Batman and Robin, who are able to handle all matters in His Majesty’s secret service, take action again and meet with Olga Curylenko, a fatal beauty of Ophelija Buletova.
A charismatic billionaire is dangerous to the minister, claiming that he can solve the problem of British computers, i.e., the evil Jason Volt, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their playbook: after they are ready for the performers, they make a fire in the French restaurant, cause chaos in the delicious Volta yacht, and English starts a complete anarchy, trying to use virtual reality ears to get acquainted with Volta's interior.
All the stops were clear to keep this last series, but whatever it's nice or wild, it's all very fond of children's television.
Pretty vegetative.
As with other films, I couldn't get rid of my mind: a non-governing British film industry cannot give Rowan an Atkinson a role that would really be worth his talent?
The Lebanese Party rejects a plan for the British for four days a week, but to be paid five days a week
Jeremy Corby's Leborist Party plans to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but to pay a fee for five days.
It is reported that the party wants the company's leaders to share in savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution (DI) by giving their employees one day off.
This would allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend and at the same time to share the same amount of pay.
The source says that this is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to channel the country's development to workers in a positive direction.
The transition to four working days was also welcomed by the Congress of the Professional Unions as a way of exploiting the benefits of the changing economy for workers.
One of the high-ranking Leborist Party’s sources, The Sunday Times, said: “The review of the political provisions is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four working days week is consistent with the party's approach to economic balancing for the benefit of employees, as well as the overall strategy of the party's industry."
The Lebanese party was not the first to promote this idea; the Green Party also won a four-day campaign during 2017.
However, this idea is not currently supported by the entire Lebanese party.
The representative of the Leiborist Party said: "The week of working days is not a party's policy and this is not considered in the party."
The shadow government representative, John McDonellis, took advantage of the opportunity to present his vision on the socialist revolution economy at the Leborist Party conference last week.
Mr McDonnell said he was willing to withdraw the government from the "free dictators" and the "profit hunters" in municipal services.
Such plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover all of their share, because, in view of the theft done, the Lebanese government can read something.
It also approved plans to include employees in the corporate board and to create own funds to transfer 10 per cent of the capital of private sector enterprises to employees and they could receive up to GBP 500 annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answered the question "60 Minutes" whether an FTB study on B. Kavanaugh could change their opinion
In the case of an investigation by the FTB on the charges brought to Judge Brett Kavanauchu, at least one final vote was postponed for a week, whether he was assigned to the Supreme Court, and then a question arises whether the fact that the Bureau of Investigations could have an impact on the opinion of some senators of the Republic so that they would not accept this judge.
At the 60-minute interview held on Sunday, the correspondent Scott Pelley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether he might be able to find out something about the FTB that would change their opinion.
You see, Senator Kennedy has a more liberal attitude than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Well, yes, of course," replied J. Kennedy.
“As I said at the meeting, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When this happened, I called him and asked, “Did you do that? ”
He answered firmly, firmly, unintelligiblely."
Mr Graham's opinion, I think, would not change anything.
“I have decided on Bretto Kavanaugh,” he says.
"Because of Dr. Ford – I don’t know what was there, but I know one thing: Brettas is categorically negative," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘No one named it can confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anyone new will ever come up."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and how has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday in New York will be a World Citizens' Festival – an annual music event that shows an impressive number of stars and aims at at at least an impressive goal – to eliminate poverty in the world.
For the past seven years, the World Citizens' Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendess, but will also learn more about the real purpose of the event – by 2030 to eliminate a particularly large deficit.
The World Citizens' Festival began in 2012. It will continue the World Fight against Poverty Project – an international mediation group that wants to eliminate poverty by actively increasing the number of people fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform various tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the world's head, calling on the phone, or, in any other way, helping to raise awareness of their intended goal of eradicating poverty.
However, do the citizens of the world succeed in achieving this goal? Until the deadline is 12 years.
Is the idea to reward people for a free concert really will convince them to demand and encourage them to act? Maybe it's just another example of so-called clickivism, fictional activism, people think that you will really change the situation by signing an online petition or publishing a Twitter network.
According to the World Citizens' Festival, since 2011, the movement has recorded more than 19 million actions of its supporters, which promote the achievement of a wide range of objectives.
They say that, under pressure, the world leaders have announced the US$37 billion commitments and policy strategies that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group identified 390 commitments and statements that the Group's actions have already paid or collected at least 10 billion US dollars.
The group has already been affected by nearly 649 million people around the world by the number of funds provided.
Among some key commitments can be mentioned "The Power of Nutrition" – a partnership between investors and operators operating in the United Kingdom, which aims to "help children grow up and reveal their full potential". With more than 4,700 messages from the World's Twitter citizens, she promised to give Rwanda US dollars to help solve the food shortage in the country.
"With the support of the United Kingdom governments, sponsors, governments of countries and such as you, the World's citizens, we can achieve that social injustices such as the lack of food become a precedent," said Ambassador Tracey Ullman at a concert held in London in April 2018.
This group also indicated that after receiving 5,000 appeals calling for improved nutrition in the United Kingdom, the government announced funding for the "Mityba power" project, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In reply to one of the FAQs, which asks, "Why do you think we can eliminate a particularly high deficit?",
The world’s citizens respond: “That is a long and difficult path — sometimes it is a struggle and a failure.
However, like the great movements of human rights and against apartheid, we will win because we are all stronger together."
Janet Jackson, "The Weekend", Shawnas Mendess, Cardi B, Janelle Monae, is a few of the performers participating in this year's New York event. The event is attended by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
As said by the Secretary of the Interior, the United States may use the ship's blockades in order to prevent Russian energy exports
"If necessary, Washington may use the fleet to hinder Russia's energy from reaching markets, as well as the Middle East markets," says US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, as said Washington Examiner.
Mr Zinke said that Russia's participation in Syria, in particular when it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext based on the research of new energy markets.
"I think that Russia is going through the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy sector, as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," R. Zinke said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States may do so by a boat, may ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, can run a blockade, and can ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
R. Zinke said this to the participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance – not a profit group, named the US "in the voice of energy users".
He further compared Washington's methods with those of Russia and Iran, and noted that they are essentially equal.
"The economic alternative of Iran and Russia is to find a greater or lower focus that would change the fuel," he said, and he also called Russia a country whose whole economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements have appeared to the short-term administration in the mission of increasing their exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and changing the market for Russia, which offers European consumers a much cheaper opportunity.
As a result, officials of the short-term administration, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the wrong North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Mr Trump, has become free of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity up to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
According to Kremlin, the root cause of Washington’s opposition to this project is purely economic, which is an unfair example of competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novakas spoke after meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position called for the opposition to Germany's reaction, and it reiterated its willingness to continue the project.
The main organisation of the German industry, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I do not really support third-country interference in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following the recent meeting of German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Masachuset says that he is seriously considering the possibility of raising his candidacy during the 2020 presidential election
On Saturday, Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, seriously discussing the question of presidential candidacy after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting in the Holocaust in Massachusetts, E. Warren approved the opportunity to apply.
"The goal is for women to go to Washington to manage our corrupt governments, they must also go to the highest level," she said in the video.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential elections."
At a meeting in the town hall, President Donald Trump was struck by Mr Warren, saying that he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very pleased with the way Donald Shortas deals with our democracy," she said.
E. Warren openly criticizes Mr. Trump and his proposed candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in a Twitter message, Mr Warren said that "a FTB study must be carried out until the vote".
However, the poll published on Thursday shows that most of the voters of the country themselves believe that it should not apply to the presidents in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the political research centre at Safolko University and Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the electors of Massachusetts are expected to say that the senator should not participate in the elections.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The survey showed that more support was expected by former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 percent of whom supported his candidacy and 48 percent opposed.
Another discussion was on the names of the representatives of the party of demonstrators for the year 2020, former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Mr Biden says that the decision will be taken in January, as the Associated Press reports.
In the conference of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin speaks of Tracko Palino’s post-traumatic disorder
The 26 - year - old Trackas Palina, who served as a military officer in Iraq, spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, after an incident in the family of violence, he was arrested and accused.
"I see what my son is going through when he comes back to his day-to-day life, so I can understand another family that feels the effects of a trauma disorder, and some of the injuries of our soldiers with whom he returns," she spoke to the meetings of Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
S. Palin called his arrest the right to avoid. She said that the sons and other war veterans “returned a little bit, they return with a tougher heart, they return in doubt, or they will be honored for what their fellow soldiers and lacquered, and all the other soldiers have returned to their country”.
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilo, Alaska, to be charged with violence in the family and assaulted against the woman, as well as accused of reporting violence in the family with a gun and in the presence of the unwarranted, as Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasil Police Department, reported to the press.
The 18 countries and the Colombian area support the opposition to the new asylum policy of asylum seekers
Eighteen states and Colombia are supporting the legal challenge of the new US policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday, 18 countries in Washington and representatives of this district submitted friendly comments to the juriae (the court consultant) to support the defence of asylum seekers' policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the applicant in the process of Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union has launched against federal politics, is not disclosed.
She says her partner "and his gang members" raped her, but on 20 July the US officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawmakers from Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the United States receives a lot of asylum requests, as a state, to address the problems of permanent gang violence and violence in the family.
The New U.S. Asylum Policy repealed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Council, which allowed non-documented immigrants fleeing the family of violence to seek asylum.
In a statement on Friday in the Colombian district, Prosecutor General Karl Racine stated that the new policy "is not applicable to existing national, federal and international laws for decades".
"Federal laws require decisions on asylum applications to be taken in the light of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and thus this principle is violated," said friends in Cuiae.
In this comment, the lawyers also say that the country's policy of preventing immigrants from entering the US is detrimental to the US economy, and that immigrants are more likely to engage in business and "provide the necessary work services".
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions pointed out in June that immigration was no longer a matter of asylum for victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"The asylum is granted to those who leave their country of residence for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or certain political views," Mr. Sessions said in a statement on the policy of 11 June.
There has never been any attempt to solve all of the problems (not all of the serious problems) that people all over the world face.
Twice, the number of victims is rising for Palu, desperately seeking the rest of the living.
The situation of the remaining living is getting worse.
"A very big attack," says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, recalling her son's burning in the city's escape center.
"The migrants do not continue to carry more and more bodies.
There is no clean water."
It has been observed that the inhabitants return to their ruined homes, collect heavy water supplies, try to save as soon as they can.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and the ruined 7.5-ball earthquake hospitals are decomposing.
Some injured people, like Dwi Haris, who have had back and shoulder fractures, have been placed in the field near the Palu army hospital, which continues to be treated in the field with severe repeated injuries.
His eyes are filled with tears as he speaks of the earthquake of a five - room hotel in which he was standing with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save others.
I am shown to have slipped across the walls," said Dr. Harris "Associated Press" and added that he and his family had come to the city to participate in weddings.
“I heard a voice of my wife’s help, and I kept silent.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope she's healthy."
US Ambassador blames China for promoting advertising
Last week, when the official Chinese newspaper distributed four pages of advertising in the US daily, covering the mutual benefit of the US and China trade, US ambassadors accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Shorty mentioned the annex of the most expensive newspaper Des Moines Register, which was paid by China, and accused China of affecting the US Congress elections on 6 November. China has denied such a charge.
"D. Briefly accusing Beijing of attempting to influence US elections, marks a new step towards a stronger Washington campaign to press China," said US officials to the Reuters Agency.
While it is common for foreign governments to distribute advertising in order to encourage trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war and both countries are collecting tariffs for imports of each other.
According to Chinese and US experts, China’s responsible tariffs were applied to exporters from Iowa and similar countries who supported the short-term Republican Party.
Terry Branstadas, US Ambassador to China, former governor of Iowa and one of the major agricultural exporters to China, said that Beijing had damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
On Sunday, article T. Branstadas, published in the newspaper Des Moines Register, said that China "is more interested in printing propaganda in the press."
“By spreading the propaganda, the Chinese government used the respected freedom of speech and the press in America and ordered a paid advertising report “Des Moines Register”, T.Brandadas wrote.
"At the same time, you will not find each other’s opposing voices in the local press corner and you will not create a real image reflecting different opinions that China’s people may have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, because the press is under the firm support of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
T. Branstad also added that "one of the most famous newspapers in China had left the printing of the proposal" but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analytical warning: As regards the mid-elections, Mr Kavanaugh rejected the voter of the Republicans
Although many republican leaders remain loyal to the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is even accused of sexual harassment, analysts have warned that this will result in a negative response during the upcoming mid-elections, especially of women.
The emotions of the situation are very strong, and many Republicans are already officially saying that they want to vote.
Such things can't be taken back later," said Professor Grant Reeheri of the University of Siracuse at Maxwell School on Saturday of The Hill.
Mr Reeheris argued whether the last-minute invitation of Senator Jeffo Flake (R-Arizona) to launch an FTB study would be sufficient to discourage the bad voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will remember it both tomorrow and November," according to the Washington newspaper, the senior advisor of the Progress Group "MoveOn" and the national representative Karine Jean-Pierre said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protestors shouted, "Lapkritis is coming!" during the demonstration, the Senate fojo, when the members of the Judicial Committee decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite the evidence of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, kzip reported "Mic".
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will strike across the country,” said the news site's non-lateral political analyst, Stu Rothenberg.
– People say it was already strong, and they're right.
But it could still strengthen the positions, particularly amongst the premiers of undecided women voters and younger voters from 18 to 29 years, who, although not in favour of the President, are often simply not voting."
Even in front of Mr Ford's public statements, when she made detailed accusations to the applicant for sexual harassment to the Supreme Court, analysts said that if the Republicans approve the candidacy, this could lead to abuse.
"Republican parties have made a big impression," said former president of the National Committee of Republicans Michael Steele at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the committee's vote or the final vote, it is not only about the fact that Kavanaugh will be appointed a judge, but also about how the Republicans managed this situation and how he dealt with Ch. B. Ford," said Guy's news channel Cecila, the Group of the Priority USA, who assists the democratic elections.
However, it seems that the Americans do not yet agree on how much to believe in the evidence of Mr Kavanaugh and Mr Ford, even though she is waiting for a little more support.
The new "YouGov" survey shows that 41 per cent of respondents are fully or most likely to believe in evidence by Ch.B. Ford, and 35 per cent are fully or most likely to believe in B. Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that B. Kavanaugh really or probably lied in giving evidence, and only 30 percent said the same thing about Ch.B. Ford.
Mr Flake, FTB is currently investigating the allegations made by Ch. B. Ford and at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, has reported, the Guardian.
Mr Ford, after his oath, gave evidence to the Senate Court Committee last week, claiming that Mr Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Mr Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed her his genitals on the evening they attended at the University of Jelio at the 9th.
The author of the newsstore plans to create a new web to oppose Google and Facebook
World Network Developer Tims Berners-Lee has created a new start to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary designer "Inrupt" is a company based on the Bernerso-Lee Open Code Platform "Solid".
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who and to which information is available.
In an exceptional interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that the Inrupt goal is to manage the world.
“We have to do this now,” he said about the start.
– It's a historic moment."
The solid technology-based software allows people to create their own online personal data store – POD.
It may include lists, lists of works, calendars, music libraries and other personal or working instruments.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would be available in a browser at the same time.
The online store of personal data is unique to the fact that only the user decides what and to which information can be accessed.
The company refers to this as a person's mandate through data.
According to Director General John Bruce of the Company, the Inrupt idea is to provide resources, processes and the necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce’s, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of programmers appointed to work with this project, and a community of volunteers programmers.
Since this week, global technology developers have been able to create their own decentralised programmes using the tools provided on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook or Google about the changes that would turn up all the business models at night.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a news release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that "Inrupt is a mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the sustainability and quality of a new solid network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a Consortium of Knowledge at the University of Massachusetts Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Knowledge Consortium, the Knowledge Fund and the Open Data Institute.
"I feel a lot of optimism about this new era of media," said Berners-Lee.
Honored Bernard Vans — A Blessed Priest in the First World War of the Victorian Cross
The 100th anniversary of the celebration of the Church of the Anglican Church was honored in its hometown, the only preacher of the Church of England who was awarded the Victorian Cross as a fighter during World War I.
The lieutenant pastor Bernard Vannas won the award on September 29, 1918, during the arrest of Belenglizo and Lukura.
Sadly, after four days of the pastors shot the sniper, so he remained unaware that he was awarded the highest award for the British army.
During the parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, the monumental stone was opened by two rings.
One of the ancestors, Michael Vannas, said that the stone was opened at 100 years after the award of the prize to the old man was “excellently symbolic”.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the lieutenant led his battalion through the Canal of St. Kent, "twenty-twenty-highly-explored smoke, heavily suffocating the state and automatic fires."
Later, he rushed to the attack line and “especially gallantly” led the line before, and then one attacked the stage and struck three battlers.
Colonel Vanna was killed by the German sniper on 4 October 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
In 72 C.E., Michael Vanna said that his grandfather’s actions were “like anyone who is never equal to anyone but who is also very humble.”
After the parade led by the imperial youth orchestra of Brentwood, Michael and his brother, Dr. James Vanna, helped the victory.
Michael Vannas said that he was honored to participate in the parade and added: “A true high priest shows the support he will give to many people. ”
MMA astrologists did not sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but had to be satisfied with "Kikolyte Pepa"
Imagine: You don't go to sleep all night to see the so-called Bellator 206, but finally you haven't seen the main vision.
There were 13 battles in San Choze's office, six of them in the main card and broadcast directly in the United Kingdom all night through Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, Gegardi Mousai and Rory MacDonald, the film "Kyulytė Pepa" was filmed after the UK viewers stopped broadcasting.
Some observers were not surprised by the fact that it was because of this struggle until the end of the day.
On Twitter, one surgeon called a change in broadcasting a child's animation film "a little trick."
“In accordance with the rules established by the government, such content is not appropriate at 6 o’clock in the morning, so it was necessary to activate the children’s programme,” asked Bellator’s Chief Marketing and Communication Vice-President Dave Schwartz on the occasion of the broadcast.
"Yes, "I loved Pepa."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that in the future, efforts will be made to adjust the timetables in the light of the United Kingdom's views.
"When I think of repetition, I think we might do it," Coker said.
“But there are 6 hours in the morning, Sunday, and we would not be able to resolve that until Sunday, in their Monday time.
But we are already working on this.
Trust that when the broadcast changed, many messages were replaced, which were not all friendly.
We tried to fix the situation, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it's a government issue.
I can promise you this won't happen again.
We will reduce the number of battles to five instead of six – as usual and we do. We wanted to give the astronauts more, but just failed.
This is a failed situation."
Desert Island Discs: Thomas Daley felt worthless about his sexual orientation
The Olympic swimmer in the water, Thomas Daley, says that he grew feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
24 sportsman only said that he was not the same as everyone at the primary school.
For the first time, Lauren Laverne, in the play “Desert Island Discs” at Radio 4 he said he began to talk to the public about the rights of hostages because he wanted to give hope to others.
He also said that as a father, it was not so important to win Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent leader of this long-term career, retired from work for several months because of the disease.
In L. Laverne’s first performance, which guests are asked to imagine traveling to an uninhabited island, T. Daley said that growing feeling is less than all the others because it was socially unacceptable to love both boys and girls.
He said: “Even these days, the feeling of poverty and cynicism was a source of strength to me that helped me to succeed. ”
He claimed that he wanted to prove the existence of this value so as not to disturb the circumstances when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The winner of the two Olympic bronze medals became a high-level LGBT activist and, participating in the games of the British Society this year, took advantage of the opportunity to invite more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he began to talk to the public about it, for he believed that he had achieved that he could live openly without any consequences, so he would like to give that hope to others.
On three occasions the world champion said that he was not expected to fall in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance, with whom he met in 2013.
Mr Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar Laureate last night, but he says that the age difference has never caused problems.
According to T. Delay, as long as he was so young – in his first Olympics he attended only 14 and after three years of cancer, his father died, – it was difficult to meet someone who was of the same age, but experienced the same height and lowness.
In June the couple became the father of Robert Ray Blacko-Daley, the perspective of T. Daley, according to him, changed completely.
"If you had asked me last night, I would have said that it was important for me to win the gold medal," he said.
– But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robis is my Olympic gold medal."
The son's name is similar to that of Uncle Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011, when he was 40.
Anto T. Daley, father didn't want to face death, so one of his last questions was whether to buy tickets to the 2012 London Olympic Games, which he wanted to watch in the first row.
"I could not tell him that he would no longer live so long that he could sit in the first row," said Dally.
– I was more concerned about the hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that it is not intimidating,” said Mr. Daley.
After a year, the athlete competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and sought bronze.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life – jumping into the water to watch local spectators in the Olympics – there is no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired the first song selection for the song – Heather Small, the "Proud", which reflected his feelings as he prepares the Olympics and is still pleasantly spraying the skin.
"Desert Island Discs" is broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 a.m. in British summer.
Mr. Mikkelson lost his form on Saturday's Ryder Tournament Tournament on the sun
American Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday, because he will be participating in the Ryder Cup tournament 47 times, but in order not to be successful, he will need to improve his form very much.
Ph. Mickelson, who has already played for the 12th time every two years in the competitions, has played Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's quarter.
Instead of being at the former centre of action, as often was in the United States, five times the main winner spent part of the day on the support team, and the rest improved his technique on the platform to correct the obstacles to play.
Even if you are not very focused on your career, 48 athletes are not the ideal player in Le Gold National’s slots, whose long strawberry meadows are extremely unpleasant for subtle blows.
In addition, as the site itself would not be sufficiently horrifying, on the ninth match that will take place on Sunday, Ph. Mickelson is playing ahead of the very goal of the British open tournament champion Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches this week along with the new guy Tommy Fleetwood.
If a four-point American can get a good start on the next 12-unit match, Ph. Mickelson's mother can become absolutely decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in his player, but he probably could not speak differently.
"He well understood the role he played today, he slapped me over my back and wrapped his hand and said that he was ready to play even tomorrow," Fury said.
- He doesn't lack confidence in himself.
He is on the list of the most famous athletes both in the past and this week very much gave to these teams.
Maybe I didn't imagine he was playing two cats.
I figured more, but it went out like this, so we decided we would.
He wants to play like everyone."
On Sunday, Ph. Mickelson will improve Nick Faldo's record and become the most successful athlete in the Ryder Cup.
This may mark the completion of his Ryder Cup career, as well as the heights of his personal records.
Ph.Mickelson belongs to 18 winners, 20 losers and seven equals, but Furykas claims that his presence has brought no material benefits to the team.
"He's kind, sarcastic, conscious, he likes to laugh from people and he's a great man with whom he's happy to be in the team room," he explained.
– I think the younger players this week were also hard to deal with, it was good to look at.
It brings much more than the game."
European Captain Thomas Bjørnas knows that a great deal can be done quickly
Thomas Bjørnas, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great deal of overcrowding to the recent competitions of the Ryder Cup can easily be made into a difficult fight.
The Danish sportsman debuted in 1997 in Valderamom, where Captain Seve’s Ballesteroso was led by a team of opponents with five points against the Americans, but the finish line was only cut at the very first result 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"We remind ourselves that we had a great advantage in Valderamom; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valderamo, where we won, but only so," said T. Bjørnas (in the picture), watching the victory of the race in 2018 as a result of 5:3 Friday and 10:6 at Le Golf National.
Then history will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll need all the power.
Go and do everything right.
Until there are no points in the board, the game is not over.
We have the goal of trying to win this prize, so we have to pursue it consistently.
I always said I trust the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well who is on the other – the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the appearance of his players in a complex space, T. Bjørnas added: “I would never want to run away from my eyes.
Tomorrow will be a whole different matter of hair.
Tomorrow will be the most important individual game – it is everything else.
It's great to play with your partner when it's all right, but when you're on the platform alone, trying your ability to play golf limits.
This idea needs to be installed for players – tomorrow you will have to push everything out of your mind.
Now you're going to have to separate with your partner, and he's going to have to print everything out of himself."
Unlike T. Bjørnas, opponent Jim Furyk expects his players to appear better individually than partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points from four.
For the last day, Fury experienced the unexpected side of both sides, because Brooklyn was on the winning team until Europe did the miracle of Medina and did not value their losers."
“I remember every damn word,” he replied, asked Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 as he motivated his players to prepare for the last day.
– We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you are looking for a quick start – as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When a speed occurs in one direction, the middle cats become very tense.
We formed our team accordingly and released the players in such a way that we, you know... we're trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Mr Thomas will be tasked with trying to wear a responsible fight and meet with Rory McIlroy's highest-level match, and among Europeans is the first Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jonas Rahmas, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulteris.
"I have selected these men in exactly this order, because I think they will successfully win the whole game," said T. Bjørnas about their choice to meet the units.
New German military ship rescheduled
The latest German military fleet had to start working in 2014 and change the Cold War Time military ships, but, according to local press, we will not see them at least until next year because of the ever-growing systems and the very high prices.
According to a military representative, quoted by Die Zeit, Rheinland-Pfalz, the main new Badeno-Viurtemberg cargo ship, the suspension of operations has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The vessel had to join the military ship in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project had already been arrested by the ship which had taken over the problems.
Four Badeno-Viurtemberg ships, which were ordered by the military ship in 2007, will replace the Bremen Class Fragata.
It is believed that they will have a powerful look, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-shipcraft missiles and certain technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Another important feature is longer supervisory intervals, which allow the latest frigates to sail far from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, the military fleet of the most advanced technologies that, as it has been said, should allow Germany to direct military power to the overseas territories, gradually before they start using them.
The unsuccessful F125 frigate last night came to the headlines when the German military ship officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This is the first time a military ship returns the ship already delivered to the builder.
The reason for the return is not known, but the German press has mentioned a number of major software and equipment defects that would have caused the ship to have no faith in the military mission.
The lack of software is very important, as the Badeno-Viurtemberg class will manage about 120 marine crews – it is through a smaller force than in the older Bramen class frigates.
In addition, it has been shown that this ship is extremely difficult – it reduces its effectiveness and limits the ability of the military fleet to put in place various improvements in the future.
It is believed that 7 000 tonnes of Rhineland-Pfalz are twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the whole project – alongside the training of technical equipment, including team training – is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it rose from the initial amount of EUR 2.2 billion to the sinking of EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The recent problems of the frigate have become very significant after recent warnings that the German military fleet is losing its power.
Earlier this year, Mr. Hans-Peter Bartelss, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the military ship is in fact "missing the proper use of ships".
The officer said that some time had passed since the old ships had already been registered, but he did not find any way to change them.
He regretted that none of the Badeno-Viurtemberg class frigates could join the military fleet.
"National Trust" Listens to the Life of a Secret Squirrel
A new study conducted in one of Scotland’s two altitudes is aimed at discovering how smallpox use the landscape when hunting for food.
The sources are expected to provide new knowledge of the behavior of unique flying mammals and to provide some guidance for future nature conservation activities.
Scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will monitor the snouts in their research, soprano snouts, red aulyses, and water-pulls in the Vester Roso Inverevo gardens.
Special recorders will be issued in certain areas of the territory allowing for the follow-up of small-scale activities throughout the season.
Staff and volunteers of the National Health Service will also carry out mobile research by hand detectors.
The analysis of all audio recordings shall be carried out by the experts to determine the frequency and activity of the low-voltage signals and of one or more types of activity.
Then a map and a report will be created for living areas to help form a detailed picture of the behaviour of the entire landscape.
"National Trust for Scotland" (NTS) natural protection adviser Rob Dewars hopes that the results will reveal which living areas are the most important for the poor and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of residential area maintenance, such as the creation of caves, as well as how best to monitor forest areas so that they are suitable for small-scale and other related species.
In the last century, the smallpox population in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have been in decline.
They are threatened by construction and real estate development, affecting the periphery and destroying residential areas.
It also threatens wind power and lightning, as well as mosquitoes, some chemical tools used to treat building materials, as well as house cats.
The bad guys aren't really blind.
However, catching a grave during the night’s fishing season helps the ears more than the eyes.
The location of the obstacles in the tramway or flight shall be precisely determined by means of the appropriate echolocation.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country, is particularly responsible for the poor.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, cross-border checks and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even created the first and only reserve for ski resorts in Scotland, in the three-storey, which is located in the Threeeve, where eight of the ten species of ski resorts in Scotland live.
The Dwarf overseer, David Thompson, says that the territory of the court is ideal for them.
"We have a great place in Thrave Two," he said.
– We have old buildings, lots of oak trees and beautiful areas to live in.
However, we do not know much about poor people, so work here and elsewhere will help them to understand what they need in order to thrive."
It emphasises that it is essential to check whether there are no malaises prior to the start of the supervisory work, since the accidental destruction of one shift may result in the death of up to 400 women and young people, which may lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Slippers shall be protected and shall be prohibited from killing, excavating or interfering, and shall be prohibited from destroying their shells.
The Scottish Small-Storage Protection Fund official Elisabeth Ferrell urged society to contribute to the rescue of small-Storage.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our poor people, and we don’t know how many local populations follow. ”
Mr Ronaldo rejected the allegations of abuse – the lawyers intend to refer the German Journal to the court
Cristiano Ronaldo called the charges he was accused of using “miracles” and said that people, using his name,“ try to get out of the way. ”
His lawyers prepared a German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which printed the charges and brought them to court.
The Portuguese and Juventus Clubs' opponent is accused of using the American Kathryn Mayorg in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
"Der Spiegel" reported on Friday that he then allegedly paid $375 000 to women so that this would end the event.
Speaking of 142 million followers alive on Instagram, a few hours after reports of accusations, the 33-year-old Ronaldo criticized them and called them “megagens”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today is melagies, they spoke five times the Ballon d'Or laureate looking at the camera.
– By using my name, they want to burn.
It's normal.
They want to be loud, to say my name is part of my work.
I'm a happy man, it's all right," the sportsman added.
According to Reuters, Mr Ronald's lawyers are preparing to refer Der Spiegel to the court on charges they called "unacceptable suspicions about the publicisation of private matters".
Judge Christian Schertzas said that the athlete would seek compensation for “moral damage, which would correspond to the significance of this breach – something good, one of the most serious violations of human rights over the past few years.”
It is claimed that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the casino and hotel apartments in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted to the Nevados Clarko District Court, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the gym, where he allegedly took it out in an anal way.
Mr Mayorga said that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo was on his way and told her that he was "99 percent good man", which was issued by the remaining "one percent" of his personality.
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted that he had sexual relations, but he claimed to have been contractually married.
Mr Mayorga also said that she had appealed to the police and that her injuries in the hospital had been photographed, but later she agreed not to agree in court, because the "very responsible actions" and did not care that they would be "publicly humiliated."
A 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to withdraw the agreement because she continues to feel the trauma of the alleged incident.
At the time of the attack, Ronaldo was incarcerated from Manchester "United" to Madrid's Real Club, and this summer, after signing a 100 million-euro value contract, he joined the Italian giant "Juventus".
Brexit. The United Kingdom would regret losing car manufacturers forever.
According to the secretary of business, Greg Clarko, the United Kingdom would "have pity forever", if Brexit had lost the world's car production leader.
It added concern over the statement by the United Kingdom to the BBC of Toyota that, if Britain withdraws from the EU without an agreement, production in the factory of Burnaston would be temporarily suspended near Derbio.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer claimed that the strike at the border would result in a loss of jobs without the agreement.
The Toyota factory, which produces the models Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% are exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of the war, our factory will have to stop production," said Toyota Director-General of Burnaston Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, also expressed concern about leaving the EU without agreement and its effects on international trade.
For example, BMW says that after the month Brexit will close its Mini factory.
According to car manufacturers, the threat posed by the supply chain Brexit without a contract is not the most serious.
The Toyota production line operates when necessary because the details of the cars produced by the order are delivered from the UK and from existing EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If, on 29 March, the EU leaves the EU without a contract, there may be problems at the border; say to these industry companies, it may be delayed to provide details or to lack them.
Toyota said that the Derbishyr factory could not keep more than one day's supplies, so production would stop.
According to Clark, the future relationship with the EU's Theresa May Chequers plan is "prepared precisely to avoid such border checks".
"We need a contract. We want to have the best contract, which, as I say, would allow us not only to enjoy the success of today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio 4 programme "Today".
"Not only Toyota", but also the data from other car manufacturers shows that it is necessary to continue to use a very successful supply chain system."
Toyota could not say when production would be suspended, but warned that, in view of the long-term perspective, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately priced jobs.
For 24 years, Peter Tsouvallar, who worked at the Burnston factory and was responsible for the "Unite" trade union meetings, said that his professional members were increasingly concerned: "I say from experience that if these jobs are lost, they will never return."
The government representative said: "We have proposed goals and confidence in future relations with the EU plan."
According to the White House, a short meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed
"In the course of the fight against the candidate for the Supreme Court's judges, a very important meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rodu Rosenstein may be withdrawn for a week," the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller – the latter is investigating Russia's interference with the elections, the relationship of short supporters with Russia and the possible impediment of the President's right to justice.
The question of whether short-term dismissal of the Deputy Attorney General, thus endangering the independence of Mueller, has been the course for months in Washington.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
However, on Monday, he went to the White House to hear reports of his resignation.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations, would take place on Thursday.
A short claim was made that Rosenstein was unwilling to forgive. Later the meeting was withdrawn so that he could not meet with the Senate's judicial committee, where he witnessed and Kavanaugh, and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford was one of the women who had been accused of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, the Short FTB decided to investigate the allegations made by Kavanaugh as well as to postpone the vote at the plenary meeting of the Senate.
The short representative of the press, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “His date is not fixed. It may take place this week, but in view of all the events associated with the Supreme Court, it may be withdrawn for a week.
But we'll see, I'll always like the press to report the news."
Some journalists do not agree with this statement: since 10 September, Sanders has not held any press conferences in the White House.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the press conferences rarely take place because they do not like TV journalists looking for effects. He added: "I have to agree with the fact that they are looking for effects for viewers."
Then he recalled that the Shorts are more common with the pressure in general directly.
"The President answers questions more often than any previous President," she said, and without any evidence, she added, "We have reviewed this statistics."
According to Sanders, press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do this and you have seen that over the past few weeks this has been done many times. Press conferences will replace your direct communication with the President of the United States."
A brief response to the questions is by leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with honored guests.
One person's press conferences are rare.
The free and sometimes strange appearance of the president before the journalists this week must have explained why.
Minister of Health for Scottish NST workers from the EU wrote about Brexit's misconceptions
The Minister of Health of Scotland sent an EU letter expressing the country's gratitude and the wish to remain after Brexit.
A member of the Scottish Parliament sent a letter to Jeane Freeman less than six months before the withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to meeting the cost of permanent residence applications for EU citizens working in the public service sector entrusted to it.
In a letter from Mr Freeman, he wrote: “The Western UK and the EU's withdrawal negotiations have continued and are approaching the forthcoming decisions this autumn.
However, the UK Government has begun to prepare for a possible scenario without a contract.
I know you're all very worried now.
That is why I wanted to repeat how I appreciate the contribution of all the workers – no matter what their nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system are useful to our patients and communities.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Emergency surgery performed by Christion Abercrombie
On Saturday during the result 31:27 "Vanderbilt Commodores" team lost their head trauma to the defense of "Tennessee State Tigers" for Christon Abercrombie, reported the journalist "Tennessen" Mike`s Organ.
The top coach in Tennessee State told reporters Rods Reeds that the trauma occurred before the break.
"He came to the side line and just smug there," Reed said.
Trainers and doctors at the side line Abercrombie were able to breathe oxygen, then put on the powder and sent it to further research.
"Tennessee State" officer Chris Harris from Neschvili (Tennis) told WSMV that the operation of Abercrombie was completed in the Vanderbilt medical centre.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type and extent of the trauma", while Tennessee State tried to determine when it happened.
The first season is played by the second race of Abercrombie from Illinois and Tennessee State.
Before leaving the match, he recovered five balls on Saturday, and the total number of balls he recovered during the season reached 18.
The buyers of the UK real estate will have to pay a higher significant fee
According to the new tax plans, the UK real estate buyers will have to pay a higher significant fee and the additional money to be obtained will be used to help the needy
This step will reduce the risk of a successful Corbyn campaign for young voters
The adult tax will be taxed on persons free of UK taxes
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will be able to raise up to 120 million pounds per year, and will allocate them to help the beneficiaries
Today, Theresa May will announce that the UK is intended to tax a higher rate of charge on the purchase of real estate by foreign buyers and the additional money received to help the needy
In order to ensure more affordable housing and to apply to large-income people, it is believed that this step will reduce the risk posed by the Jeremy Corby's campaign to attract young voters.
An increase in the tax will be taxed on people and businesses free of UK taxes, and additional money will be provided to promote the government's fight against unemployment.
The additional fee shall be paid in addition to the current flag tax, including two years ago, for the second or three-percent leased houses or houses.
The Ministry of Finance expects this step to raise up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built property in London will be purchased by non-US residents, making it more difficult for buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time away from the country, so many of the rich countries and especially the capital areas became city figures.
The new strategy was presented just a few weeks ago, when Boris Johnson called for a significant reduction in tax and thus helped more young people to buy the first houses.
He accused large construction companies of quickly purchasing land, but not using it, of maintaining high real estate prices, and urged May to address the neglect of the British housing by rejecting purchased household allowances.
Corbyna has published several proposed housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the prohibition of landing without guilt.
He also wants more power to build new homes for municipal councils.
“ In the years that followed, ” said May, “I said that I would be able to return to the British dream as a prime minister, and life would have to be better for every new time.
This means that we need to set up our damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work here, and create life.
However, it is wrong that non-EU citizens and foreign-based companies can also buy homes as easily as those working hard in the United Kingdom.
Many people's dream of having a home has become almost unimplemented, and the threat of undermining the estate is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish team"
Sunderland's leader, Jack Ross, says that his ultimate goal is to ever become Scotland's elected leader.
The 42-year-old Scout likes the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which is currently in the third place of the first league and three points away from the first-place club.
After returning to Scotland's championship last season, St. Mirren moved to Stadium of Light this summer.
"As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I went to a crowd of B and that's all over," Rossa told the BBC program "Scottland's Sportsound".
“But in my childhood I grew up in Hamden Stadium with my father in view of many Scottish election competitions, and that always attracted me to return.
True, this opportunity will only take place if I have managed the club successfully."
Iki Rosso "Sunderland" led Dick's lawyer, David Moyes, Sams Allardyce, Martin O'Neillas, Roy`s Keane, Gus Poyetas and Paulo Di Canio.
Previously, after rejecting the Barnsley and Ipswich Town proposals, the former head of Alloa Athletic said he was not worried about starting to work after such well-known leaders in such a large club.
"Now my success will be assessed by the answer to the question "Can I return this club to the Premier league?"
According to the structure and conditions, this club certainly belongs to the "Premier" league," he spoke.
"It's not easy to take him back, but I'm probably just going back to the club and I think I worked here successfully."
Rosso's leadership career lasts only three years. Prior to that, he worked as a manager at the Dumbarton Club and for 15 months replaced Hearts coaches.
Later, he helped restore to the third division of Alloa, and the St Mirren Club, which was threatened to fall, turned the winners into the next season.
Rossa says she is now more satisfied than ever in her career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic clubs.
"This change was probably radical," he recalls about the leadership of Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that it was better for me to be guided than to play.
That sounds strange because I have succeeded, I have made a lot of money, and I am happy with the success I have enjoyed.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many problems each week.
And now it's not easy – working stress and stress, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it. I've always felt like I'm in my heart, but leadership gives me the greatest satisfaction."

Studies have found that the best year of brewing is on Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer’s heat wave increased the income of the poorly growing British cables, but the burden of the restaurants’ networks was even more heavy.
The figures revealed that the sale of lipids and bar groups increased by 2.7 per cent, but income in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
According to CGA, Peter Martin’s business consultant, who prepared this data, said: “Inexhaustible sunshine and longer than expected, England’s participation in the world’s championship showed that July continued to be a similar trend as in June when the income of the deaf increased by 2.8 percent.
In June, trade in restaurants decreased by 1.8 percent, and the situation worsened in July.
The main income from the sales of beer and bar results was undoubtedly the best, and trade in them grew stronger than in restaurants.
Although not as strong as restaurant companies, the sunflower also suffered major revenues from food supply.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sale of beverages in well-functioning beer and bars increased by 6.6 per cent this month and the sale of food fell by 3 per cent."
“ These results continue to be visible from the end of April,” said Paul Newman, from the RSM analysis of the leisure and fertility sector.
As regards food establishments, the main factors continue to be air and the impact of the most important social and sport events.
Thus, it is not surprising that restaurants continue to suffer. True, not one year’s sales of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful, as it will contribute to an unfavourable cost-related pressure.
Most of the income from food-producing companies could not come in the worst time in the summer. Time will show whether a milder August feeling will give the necessary refreshment."
The overall sales growth in the deaf and restaurants, including newly opened sites, was 2.7 per cent and reflected the slowing of the development of networks belonging to trademarks.
The UK's guidelines for the deaf, the bar and the restaurant sector recognise the "The Coffer Peach Tracker" sales monitoring tool collects and analyzes operational data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds.
One of the five children has social media subscriptions from their parents
The study revealed that one of the five children – some of whom are only 11 years of age – have social media subscriptions hidden from parents and teachers
20 000 high school students survey revealed that more would be found on the Insta pages
The news strengthened the fear of the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had to show their parents the main heading
One of the five children – some at the age of 11 – is a secret social media account and is hidden from adults.
The 20 000 high school students survey revealed that a rapid increase in the insta pages would be seen – this refers to the Instagram website of the photography community.
The news strengthened the fear of the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students have said that they are using a censored main item to show their parents, but they also have hidden items.
One mother, who happened to be on a secret Web site in her 30 ’ s, learned that the teenager was provocatively offering: “Get me out of here. ”
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and independent Directors' Conference (MDK) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-old students had two chapters, and half of them admitted to hiding.
The MDK leader Mike Buchanan said: “The fact that so many teenagers are willing to create virtual spaces in which parents and teachers cannot find them is a matter of concern. ”
Elidha Doyle will vote in the Scottish Sports Council
At the general annual meeting of the Scottish Sports Council Management Authority, Elidha Doyle was elected as consultant at her director.
Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for sports-leading people to benefit from a variety of international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidha earned great respect throughout Scotland, the UK and the world's sports community, and we are sure that its inclusion in the Scottish sports council will be of great benefit," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to serve as a sportsman's voice and hope that I will really contribute and help guide sports in Scotland."
A 200-400-metre match in 1996 in the Atlantic Games and a total of four Olympic gold medals was won by an American, now a permanent BBC expert, after the short-term ischemic attack.
"Twitter," he wrote, "I experienced the stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I would succeed.
I had to work before the execution, but I was completely healed, and I learned to walk again, and today I am doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging message."
A breast-feeding advertising that compares mothers to cows on the Internet has received different evaluations
The pregnant woman’s production company received different opinions about her advertising, which compared breast-feeding to dairy cows.
In order to mark the product described as the world's first silent breast development, the beginning of trade, the technology company for consumers "Elvie" issued an in-depth advertisement of the ironic music video video. It aims to demonstrate the freedom provided by the novels to the feeding mothers.
In this full caravan, four real mothers dance according to the sound recording they hear, for example, the words: "Yes, I lie to myself, but no offense" and "If you haven't noticed, here is no gossip, here is my breast."
The appendix continues: “Take him away, take him away, feed him, take him away, take him away, take him away, lie down with my beautiful ones. ”
However, advertising published on Facebook led to an online dispute.
In the 77,000 times reviewed and several hundred comments received, viewers responded differently. Many claimed that it was viewed per finger in the dairy industry’s greed.
"The advertising of cows for this product is a very bad decision.
Like us, they must be pregnant and born to produce milk, only when their newborns are removed from them a few days later," one woman wrote.
"Elvie" breast ring invisible space in the feeding trough ("Elvie" / "Mother")
Another commented: “It is understandable that it is traumatic for both mother and newborn.
But why not take advantage of the advertising of breast-feeding for mothers whose babies are not taken from them?"
Another added: “Advertising is a complete misunderstanding. ”
Another commentator’s advertisement was defended – one woman admitted that her song turned out to be “very heavy”.
“I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy it if I'd still feed.
When milk stopped, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit pointless, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is brilliant," wrote one.
Another comment was: “This heavy advertising is intended for mothers who take their milk off (often in jobs or in toilets) and feel like cows.
Its purpose is not to drink or condemn the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group reveals that all shocks with tapes are undetected.
The campaign’s idea is based on the perception that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie sticker does not reveal any sound, has no tapes or tubes, and is invisible in the dining room – so women can, when milk is stopped, move freely, keep the babies or even leave the house.
The "Mother" partner and executive director of creation Ana Balarin commented: "Elvie" is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative start to trade it.
In comparison with milk cows, we wanted to draw attention to the withdrawal of milk and to all its challenges, but also to the extent possible by showing the incredible sense of freedom that will be granted by new ticks.
"Elvie" was not the first time on the press.
During the London fashion week, a collection of designers Martos Jakubowski, a mother of two children on the podium, demonstrated using this product.
These migrant children quietly moved to the tent camp at the Texas border
The number of people crossing the border during the month has not changed substantially, but the number of children of detained migrants has increased considerably, partly because of the severe rhetoric and policies of the Short Administration made it harder to accommodate them with the guardians.
Traditionally, most of the guardians themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid that when they asked for the child’s care, they would risk being able to stay in the country.
Following the announcement by the Federal Government of June that potential guardians and other adult members of their families will have to present fingerprints and these data will be shared with immigration authorities, the risk has increased.
Last week, the Chief Officer of the Immigration and Customs Service, Matthew Albence, confirmed to Congress that the institution had detained several ten people who had applied for the care of adult minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had not been convicted in the past.
“Approximately 80 percent of these people — their guardians or their family members — live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
We will therefore continue to pursue these people," Albenz said.
According to the authorities, new rules have been introduced in order to deal with cases of children. According to them, some children must appear in court within a month of detention, not within 60 days, as was customary in the past.
Many will attempt to defend the legal status of the lawyer on immigration issues, not by personal arrival, but by means of a conference video call.
Unrecognised beneficiaries will be deported quickly.
According to the report received by the undercover staff and in the last few months of the system, the longer children remain detained, the more likely they will be to become restless or depressed, which may lead to forced passage or attempts to escape.
The defenders say that this causes even more anxiety in large institutions, such as the Tornyl shelter: they increase the likelihood of not seeing signs of child fighting.
They added that moving children to a tent town without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say good - bye to their friends can enhance the trauma they have experienced.
Syria immediately withdrew from the United States, France and Turkey's occupying forces
In addition, when addressing the UN General Assembly, foreign minister Walidas al-Moualemas has invited Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been taking place for eight years.
Moualem, acting as Vice-President of the Prime Minister, said that the anti-terrorism campaign against foreign forces in Syria is illegal and will be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately without any conditions," he said.
Moualem claimed that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died since 2011, and millions had to leave home, the war on terrorism was almost over.
He said that Damascus would not be able to fight this war until we destroy both terrorist groups and any illegal foreigners in all the territory of Syria.
There are about 2,000 United States soldiers in Syria who mainly train and consult the Kurdish forces and President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land soldiers in the devastated country.
As to the problem of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for returning them are good, and he accused some Western countries of spreading unjustified fear that they would refuse to return.
"We have created an international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return," he said.
"They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would receive recovery aid only when Assad and the opposition reached a political agreement and ended the war.
The UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey in the last major fortress in Idlibe has created conditions for faster progress in political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented the large-scale seizure of the Russian-supported Syrian forces, directed towards the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the terms set out in the agreement were clear. He also expressed hope that military action would be directed to the jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra front, which would be destroyed.
The UN envoy, Staffana de Mistura, is hoping to convene the first meetings of the Committee of the Government and Opposition Members, which will prepare a draft Syrian post-constitution and prepare soil for the elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions under which the Syrian Government would participate in the Committee: the work of the group must be limited to the revision of the current articles of the Constitution, and warned not to interfere.
Why will the Short be chosen for the second term?
On the basis of this logic, in 2020, the short will be chosen, unless, as many liberal observers are expected, its presidency would have been condemned and scandalized in the past.
Without a doubt, it would be the most dramatic ever after the end of the presidency!
Until the sights are too tired to see signs of fatigue.
From 2014 the best broadcasting time ratings on CNN television increased by more than twice ¢ to 1.05 million and the MSNBC was nearly tripled by 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million best broadcasting time viewers, with an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" takes the first place in cable television rankings with even 3.5 million viewers' main news evenings.
"The fire that attracts people because of something we don't understand," says Nealas Baerer, producing the ABC series Descedent, about the secretaries of the Cabinet of Ministers, who, after the collapse of the House of Congress, becomes president.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and “Just a few pieces of passion and a few incredible truths, how secretly to get to the Hollywood Boys Club”, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.

"Why?" she asked.
"He said, "He's making fun of me," said Scovell.
Chaos is worth missing.
Of course, contrary to what is shown on television, the events that are coming up from Washington can determine the future of the Roe before Wade, the possibility of bringing together immigrant families and the world economy.
The lack of insight is a pleasure that only privileged viewers can afford.
And yet this is more than necessary, in order to be informed by a citizen, when you realize that for six hours you have been watching a group of experts discussing how Bob Woodwards uses unpublished data for his book "Baimė", Paul Manafortas demonstrates the US $15,000 priced leather strip ("the Washington Post") (the "big cover") and what is meant by the description of Stormy Daniels Trump's anatomy.
At least I'll never see Super Mario again.
"His actions remind you of a reality show, because every evening he calls you something", about the changing actors and day-to-day bets (incarnation with N.F.L. or honoring Kim Jong-un) says the Director General of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars" Brent Montgomery.
You can't miss a single series, otherwise you'll be back.
When I contacted Fleiss this week, there were 27 degrees of heat and education in the north of the Kauai, but he was inside the tunnel and, writing CNN, watched MSNBC.
He could not open the door – indeed not when Brett Kavanauchu was stationed against the Senate Courts Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the hair.
"I remember when we made those stupid shows, people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," said Fleiss.
"I thought it was a trick here, but it turns out they were right."

In the forced mid-term elections to the House of Representatives, the fight for the money comes from the environment
It is no wonder that, due to the reorganization of the congresses, which ended with the attempt to win the same post by the two members of the Board of Representatives, the 17th quarter of Pennsylvania fell to the money.
The recently reorganized Pittsberg district included a Democratic Member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb – last spring he won his place during a special election in another district.
Lambas competes with another member of the House of Representatives, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania. Much of it transcends with the new 17th.
The maps were changed when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided on its own that in violation of the Constitution, the former districts had been falsified for the benefit of the Republics.
During the fight against elections in the new 17th round, the financial institutions of the main parties, the Congress Committee of the Democratic Campaign (DKK) and the National Commission of the Republican Campaign (NRC), have come together on the financial side of the campaign.
Lambas in Pennsylvania was thrilled when in the 18th district of Congress, a small surplus of votes won the wide-ranging special elections that took place in March.
More than a decade ago, the Republicans took over, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
The political leaders gave the Democrats such an advantage.
The United States considered El Salvador punishing for its support for China, but then drowned.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, but did not in principle receive adverse reactions from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump took part in a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and until the partners launched the "Trump Organization" management, he had a hotel in this country.
"Because of the recent decisions taken, officials from the State Department of Taiwan have decided to revoke the heads of the diplomatic missions of the United States of America from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama," said Heather Nauert in a previous report published this month.
However, sanctions are being considered only for Salvador, who received approximately US$ 140 million in 2017, as well as for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions involving the reduction of financial aid and visa restrictions applicable to individuals would have been painful for the Central American country with a high level of unemployment and murder.
During the internal meetings, the North and Central American officials held a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to be held after the same meeting last year, which was held an important step forward in order to prevent migrants moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior administrative officials clearly indicated the wishes for the conference to take place, thus essentially ending any discussion of the sanctions against Salvador.
"In order to show the importance of this meeting by the administration, the list of speakers for the conference planned in mid-October is now included by Vice-President Mike Pence," the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without reporting any threats or penalties to Washington.
The representative of the White House refused to comment to Bolton on the details of the discussion that three American officials, including two diplomats, expressed. They agreed to discuss internal discussions only if their anonymity is preserved.
Their statements are confirmed by a close external analyst to the administration, as well as by speaking if its anonymity is preserved.
Learn History
The Special Adviser Robert Mueller’s report on the possible impediment to the justice of the short-term can be expected to be inevitable – his very strong evidence is now available in public archives.
In addition, as it is said, Mueller's investigation is asking whether the short campaign has not been carried out in secret in cooperation with our elections, Russia is damaging.
If Congress were to move to other hands, Trump would have to assume responsibility in this institution at the same time as he is preparing to stand before voters again, and perhaps even before the Board of Governors.
There is a lot of "if" here and I do not say that the end of the trumpet is inevitable – just as it does in Europe.
We will all have to choose on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will determine whether the fight will continue for a long time.
In 1938, German officials were ready to take Hitler away — it was necessary for the West to oppose him and support the Czechs in Munich.
We took our time and missed the opportunity to stop the path that lasted for several years.
History revolves around such essential points of action, thereby speeding up or suspending the mark of democracy.
Now the Americans have come to a number of such important points.
What will we do if the short one is fired by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man from whom the fate of the Mueller investigation belongs?
Rosenstein’s troubles began when this newspaper reported that last year the official proposed to register the president secretly and considered his incompatibility with these duties.
Rosenstein says the "The Times" is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the new FTB is being investigated by Bretto Kavanaugh or if, despite the sexual pressure and false evidence, this candidate will be appointed to the Supreme Court?
And finally, at the mid-term elections, will we vote for Congress, which will force the Short to assume responsibility?
If we do not keep these tests, democracy is threatened by a long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will keep them.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, and she was taken to Osvencium by the same nation regime as I used to live in homes where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and after 60 years, I was sent to burn a shabby candles on a table with a pillow.
When I have such a legacy, how can I look at our future unoptimistically?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers' settlement with Rapid Vienna waiting optimistically
On Thursday, Rangers will accept Rapid Vienna, knowing that if this month the impressive competitions with Villarreal that had been held in Spain earlier this month could be successful in a strong position to leave the G group.
Because of the road trauma, the middle player Graham Dorrans was only able to appear this season for the first time only at 2:2 in the final match with Villarreal. But he hopes that the Rangers Club can use this result as a tramplin for more important goals.
"We were good at this because "Villarreal" is a great team," a 31-year-old player said.
“We started to play by believing that we could achieve something, and we ended this achievement.
Perhaps at the end of the day, we could be more peaceful, but in general, the competition was not bad.
They're probably better at playing the first cell, and we hit the second one and showed us what we're better team.
There will be another important evening in the European League on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points. The game will be difficult, because in the last competitions their results were great. But I do not doubt that with the support of the spectators we can advance and achieve a good result.
Last year was really hard – and what was going on with my traumas, and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the boys are really happy; the training is great.
I hope we can now get ahead, forget the past season and play a successful game."
A woman with fear of these pensions is insinuating
Although the audience had a clear picture of what kind of care they would like to receive, few spoke to family members about it.
Approximately half of the Nationalwide respondents claimed that they were talking to their spouses about the price of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said he talked to the children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't have to talk about it," said Vice-President Holly Snyder of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
That's what we need to start with.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you do not report your wishes in advance, you will not be prepared to take care of your family.
Please discuss with the consultant and the family where and what supervision you would like to receive, as these factors may be important to predict costs.
Call the financial advisor. The advisor can also help to figure out how to pay these costs.
You may decide to pay these costs by means of a traditional long-term insurance certificate, a combination of a cash-value life insurance certificate, or by insurance your assets as long as you have money.
Select legal documents. Prevent legal disputes in order to protect documents.
Choose your health care authority. Select a reliable person who will take care of your medical care and ensure that specialists respect your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Also, think of the authority to care for your finances.
You should choose a reliable person who would make financial decisions for you and make sure that the accounts are paid if you become ineffective.
Do not forget the details. Imagine that your elderly parent or mother needs emergency medical attention and that he or she is being taken to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
To prepare, write down these details in the plan.
"Not only financial matters are important. What are doctors?" asked Martin.
‘What medicines?
What will the dog care for?
Plan it too."
In Ilfrakum, the pneumatic shooter was shot several times by a man.

Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
"At least 384 died when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday," officials say.
As a result of the destruction of the communications aid services, officials were unable to obtain any data from the Dongal Regent – north of the Palais region near the 7,5th earthquake epidemic.
In the face of disaster, more than 16,000 people are evacuated from Palu.
Here are some of the most important facts about Paul and Dongal on the island of Slaves.
In 2017, about 379 800 inhabitants owned by Palu are the capital of the central province of Sulaves, created at the end of the valley on the west coast of Sulaves Island.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city was celebrated for 40 years.
Dongala is a regent with a coast of more than 300 km (180 miles) north of the island of Slaves.
In 2017, about 299,200 people lived in the smaller administrative region.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Province of Slovenia, in particular in the coastal region of Dongal.
It is also important in the province that the fortress of Nickel, the truth, concentrated mainly on the other side of the Sulavesi coast in Moravia.
According to the Indonesian disaster reduction agency, Paul and Dongala suffered several times over the past century from tsunamis.
In 1938, the tsunami in Dongal killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, Dongal was killed by nine people.
On the six - ever - active ramie fires, Indonesia is constantly being struck by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have taken place in recent years.
On 26 December 2004, a severe earthquake in the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and then killed 226,000 people, more than half of them in Aceh.
At the end of March and early April, several strong tremors struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Nearly 100 people died on the island of Nias.
In 2006, the shock of the force of the ball hit the southernmost denser part of the Indonesian island of Java and caused a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
In 2009, a 7.6-threshold earthquake hit the area near the western capital of the province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
In 2010, the shock of the 7,5 ball force struck one nearby island of Mentawa, and caused a tsunami with up to 10 metres of waves, which swept ten villages and killed about 300 people.
In 2016 Paddy Jaya's regentness, which is due to the insatiable earthquake in Acehe, was destroyed and panicked, as people's memories of how everything was destroyed after the terrible earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This is not the case with the tsunami, but the devastating buildings have killed more than 100 people.
In 2018, strong quakes struck the well-run island of the Indonesian tourists, Lomboka, and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists temporarily collapsed on the coast.
The chief son of Sarah Palin detained for domestic violence
As a result of the charges, Trackas Palinas, the son of the chief former governor of the Allies and the candidate for Vice-Presidents Sarah Palin, was arrested.
The report published on Saturday by the Alaskan Police states that 29-year-old Palinas from Vasil (Aliaska) was arrested in the face of domestic violence, the prevention of domestic violence and the detention of opposition.
As stated in the police report, when a known attempt was made to call the police to report suspected crimes, he picked up the phone.
As KTUU reported, Palin returned to the pre-trial detention facility in Mat-Su and released for $500 security.
"Today he appeared in the court where he was asked to justify himself was completely innocent," the network reported.
The strike is charged with three Class A offences, which means that up to one year may be charged and punished with a fine of US$ 250 000.
He is also accused of infringing class B, punishing the day in prison, and punishing $2 000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palino.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a suspected assault.
The case is currently being considered by the Alias Veterans Court.
This event is linked to the submission of charges of domestic assault in January 2016, preventing the reporting of the crime of domestic violence and the detention of the armed forces.
His girlfriend said that he had hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism from the veteran groups when harsh behaviour of her son was linked to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after Friday in the tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Slaves.
7.5 The earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.

Federal Prosecutors of the New York terrorist attack are seeking the death penalty rarely applied.
In New York, federal prosecutors are seeking death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack committed in New York City that killed eight people. It is a rare penalty that has not been committed in this country for federal crimes since 1953.
On 31 October, it is suspected that 30-year-old Saipov from the Home Depot took the truck off and set up an assault on the bicycles so near the western highway in the Land of Manhattan – while driving there, the pedestrians and the riders were dropped.
As stated in the report on the intention to pursue the death penalty in the south of New York, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipova deliberately killed eight victims and deliberately caused serious bodily injury.
According to the court's document, both of these accused points may close the death penalty.
After a few weeks of assault, the federal high-ranking jury announced to Saipov a 22-point indictment covering eight counts of murder related to the use of assets (usually in cases of organised crime by federal prosecutors) and the prosecution of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors say that the attack was very well planned and preconceived, and that what Saipov did called it was cruel, cruel, and immoral.
“The actions of Sayfull Habibulaevicius Saipov have caused the loss of the following family members and friends: Diego Enrique Angelino, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darreno Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernano Ferruchio, Hernano Diego Mendozos and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucco,” says the report on intentions.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case of the death penalty was discussed in the South New York District decades ago.
Khalidas Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but finally in September 2009 he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The death penalty was last executed in 1953 in the New York federal case for Julius and Ethelai Rosenberg, when they were sentenced to two years ago for bribery to the Soviet Union in the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death on June 19, 1953, in an electric seat.
According to the case-law, Saipov, who was born from Uzbekistan, did not suffer for his behaviour either immediately after the assault or after a few months.
According to the police, he told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipova revealed to officials that he was inspired by the images of the Islamic State (ISIS) on his phone to carry out the attack.
The police also told him that he had asked the hospital to reinstate the flag of the Islamic State.
He did not confess his guilt on the basis of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the defenders of the federal state funded by Saipov, said that they were clearly disappointed in the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than to acknowledge the guilt and to punish the living head without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma of these events to all those involved," Patton said.
Saipovo's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to reach the death penalty.
The honourable Member says that Brexit must be responsible for the negotiations of NIGELAS FARAGE
Today, during a protest at the so-called conference, Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the nation's army.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must feel the heat of Eurosceptics, and one of the MPs in Theresa May suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Community Chamber, Peter Bone, told demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would have already left if Brexit had been Farage.
But the difficulties that May is facing in trying to bring together those who are in conflict with them have revealed the paths that the EU has promised to leave, which have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
It is difficult for the Prime Minister to implement a compromise plan agreed in the Czech Republic when it is imposed by Brexit's supporters, opponents and the EU.
The allies strongly demanded that it seek to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the adverse reactions and force Eurosceptics and the Libyan Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bone, during the "Leave Means Leave" meeting, Solihale said he wanted to destroy the Czech Plan.
He said that Farage had to be an equal partner and that he had to be given the responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been a leader, we would have already left the EU," he said.
The member of the Velingbor parliament added: "I am fighting for Brexit," but we must reject the Chekers plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We fought in world wars, not to obey others.
We want to adopt our laws in our own country."
'Bone's denied the impression that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'I believe that British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is absolutely not true'.
Brexit removed the tower Andrea Jenkyns also participated in demonstrations and journalists said: "I just say: Minister President, listen to people.
The Chekers' plan is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is not popular among our party members and activists who go on the streets and, above all, vote for us.
Answer the Chekers plan and start listening."
In her critical report, May added: “The prime ministers kept their posts when they kept the promises.”
Farage said that wet politicians must be forced to feel warm if they issue a decision taken by the referendum in 2016.
"This is now a question of confidence in our people and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to issue Brexit, so today we're here to tell them that we're not going to let them do this."
He added in his appeal to the enthusiastic mine: "I want you to force our political class, which almost released Brexit, to feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the army of this country, which has brought us the Brexit victory, and we will not stop until we become independent, municipal and glorious in the United Kingdom."
And the enemies of Brexit, two hours before the meeting in the city center, were marching through the streets of Birmingham.
After this weekend, the group was set up by the bartenders, who had been active in mystic posters "Torias v. Brexit".
Leborist Lord Adonis seized the conservative on the security problems they experienced as a result of the party's programme at the start of the conference.
"Those people who say they can install IT systems and all the technologies needed for the "Canada plus Plus" option for borders without borders and free trade with Ireland," he said.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to take a serious look at the presidential elections
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections she would seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential elections.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat was talking about his future in a meeting with the public on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who constantly criticises President Donald Trump, participates in the November re-elections that will meet with GOP's representative Geoffu Diehlu, one of the leaders of the short campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was assumed that it could meet with Trump in 2020.
Since the time that Short became president, the Saturday afternoon event in Holjok has been 36 meetings with voters using the format of a public meeting with the public.
One participant asked whether she was planning to participate in the presidential elections.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and set up a sub-government, which must be directed by a woman.
Detained suspect in the LSU Sims case
The police of Baton Ružo, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that he had arrested the suspect who had been charged with killing LSU's purse in Wayde Sims.
At 11.00 a.m. press conference, the Baton Ružo Police Department reported that 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was detained.
The police distributed a video of the shooting on Friday and asked to help identify the man who was seen in it.
Twenty years ago, Samson was shot and died near the city of the South University on Friday.
According to "247sports", police chief Murphy J. Pauls reported on Saturday that Wade Simss was shot in the head and died of injuries.
Wade stood up to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having a gun and a show at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was held without opposition and was imprisoned in the Eastern Baton Rose Police Department.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the world championship title when the team told him to give the victory to Sebastian Vettel
When Walter Bott took over Lewis Hamilton on a six-day qualifying ride, it immediately became clear that the instructions of the Mercedes team would be very important in the race.
In the first place, Bott began a great start and, taking his position in the first two stages, did not just stay in Hamilton’s trouble, encouraging Vettel to attack his team friend.
The first of them went to the two open garage, left Hamilton, and he went back to the train station, so it was decisive.
Mercedes entered the two open garage behind the wheel and returned to the road to Vettel, but Hamilton, after not having finished contact, set out in advance when the driver of Ferrari after double manoeuvre, in order to maintain his position in the third stage, accidentally released the internal side of the road.
On the 21st day of the celebration, Max Verstappen began at the end of the row, but at the end of the first wheel was already seven.
It was the fastest part of the race, because it was driving without changing the tires to be the fastest finish, hug Kimi Raikkonen and the fourth finish.
At the end of his 44 ’ s, he entered the two-hole garage, but in the remaining eight wheels he was unable to increase the pace and the Raikkonen finish line by a quarter.
“It was a difficult day for Walter because he had followed him well all weekend, and when I was asked to leave, he acted like a real gentleman.
The team worked well and found the first two places," said Hamilton.
It was really a dead body language.
President Donald Short met with the people during the Saturday meeting with Senator Diane Feinstein because of the negativeness of the letter by Christine Blasey Ford, in which a candidate for the Supreme Court judge Bretta Kavanaugh is accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking in Western Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's evidence to the Senate's legal committee, but said that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are poor, dishonest and wrong.
"What has happened and actually happens in the last days of the Senate when you see anger when you see that people are wicked, poor, dishonest and unjust," he said.
“When you see official statements and disappearances, and then you say, ‘ Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you find out?
Do you remember her answer to the question, or did the document come out?
Not really.
I didn't fall."
Well, wait a minute.
If we die... no, we don't die," he added, seeing the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's accusations to Kavanaugh and which had been executed earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letters had been removed from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein's committee said, "I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations and her history."
"She asked to keep it secret, and so did I, as she asked."
However, it seems that the negative president did not agree with her, saying at a meeting with people on Saturday evening: “You know, it was really a bad language.
Maybe it didn't happen, but it was the worst language I've ever seen in my body."
The President, in continuing to refer the candidate to the judges of the Supreme Court, who had been accused by three women of sexual misconduct, said that the democrats had used accusations for their own good.
"They have chosen to restore power by any necessary means.
You have seen cruelty, inability; they don't care what they hurt or have to move to gain power and control," another president's speech "Mediaite".
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer's match with Dandi Club "Giants" won two prizes
"Dundee Stars" came back for the defeat of Belfast's "Giants" on Friday's Elite League and won a Saturday's responsible match with Dandi score 5:3.
"Giants" soon set out in advance, when the two adventures won Patrick Dwyers and Francis Beauvilliers.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownieis were a comparative result, before Dwyer again took the Giants forward.
Francoi Bouchard of the Dandi team compared the result, but later two of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's teams won the victory.

The flight manager died to help hundreds of passengers escape the earthquake
The head of Indonesia’s flight was announced by a giant when he was killed by an airplane with several hundred passengers safely flying into the air.
More than 800 people died, and the majority are considered to be the worst of tsunamis on the Friday of the island of Slaves.
The site continues to carry strong repeated underground strikes and the majority of people are trapped in the ruins of the city.
Although the colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavans Aggang refused to leave his post in the heavily floating management box in Palu Mutiaros Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He stayed at his place of work to help the flight of 6321 to the Batik Air, which had already been on board so safely.
Then, thinking that the flight control tower is broken, he jumped out of it.
He died in the hospital later.
According to Australia's ABC News, Indonesia's air navigation representative Yohannes Sirate stated that his decision could save hundreds of lives.
We took him out of Kalimantan to a larger hospital in the city.
Unfortunately, we're missing him this morning, and he won't reach Pale.
"This is a message to us without any harm," he added.
And the government is afraid that the number of fishermen can rise to thousands, as the country's disaster reduction agency reports that the cities of Dangal, Sigio and Boutongo are very difficult to reach.
"It is believed that the number of victims will increase, because many victims are still behind the traps and we cannot reach them," said the Agency's representative, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which is six meters high, shall be destroyed: it shall be built on the day of the month of the month of the feast.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and reserves.
A 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma, Sky News, said: “The fast cars bring the victims every minute.
There's no clean water.
All around the retail shop."
The head of the International Indian Red Cross, Janis Gelfandas CNN, said: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is eager to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation can get worse."
Indonesia’s President James Widodas came to Palao on Sunday and asked the country’s army: “I am writing to all of you to work day and night in order to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" Reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that when the plane crashed into the lagoon, one person is dead.
The flight that ended the plane crash in the Pacific Ocean, which is part of Micronesia, now on the airline, says that one man is dead, although he previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members were rescued from a stunning plane.
In the report, Air Niugini said that on Saturday afternoon they had no knowledge of a passenger man.
The air lines indicated that they cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and researchers when looking for a man.
The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for further information on the journey, such as its age or nationality.
The local boats helped to save other passengers and crew when the plane, attempting to land at the airport of Chuk Island, fell into the water.
On Friday, the officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airlines said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, all of which were stable.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and what was the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. military ship reported that the plane had landed in the camp without such landing.
Some Witnesses have found that the plane did not have a chance to land on the landing like this.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane fell from very low.
"That was very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to crash before the crash.
He said that the flight attendants were panicked and shouted, and he himself experienced a minor head trauma.
The U.S. Navy ship reported that by repairing the nearby bay, their mariners also helped to rescue people who were forced by the boat to the edge before the plane crashing into a depth of about 30 metres.
According to Air Safety Network data, over the last two decades, Papua New Guinea has killed 111 people in aircraft accidents registered in Guinea, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
The analyst set out the sequence of events at night when the woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor set out the facts available on Saturday in the case of a man who was accused of having burned a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how they used mobile phone records to connect the death of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the Nineteen-year-old victim Jessica Chambers movement.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber at the time of her death, and this contradicts previous statements.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with Michael Sanford, the police came to ask Sanford.
On Saturday Sanford expressed his position and testified that he had not been in his city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth, saying that he was on Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he "was lying because his trucks were in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after this died.
Mobile phone records show that they met each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis from his phone, he picked up Chambers' messages, calls, and addressed information.
"He got her out of his life," said Hale.
It is expected that the defence of its final arguments will begin on Sunday.
The judge told me that the case would be handed over to the jury later that same day.
"The High Breed": what is a conscious hippopas?
Hiphopo third wants to change the negative attitude of this genre by spreading positive messages to his music.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hippopus is far from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social problems.
They want to go back to the sources of the hippopus and repopulate the conscious hippopus.
The performers such as The Fugees and Commons recently reborn the UK in the works of Akala and Lowkey.
One more black?
New York court dismissed a couple after they were fired from work for a "racist" message.
The New York court handed a couple to the court for dismissal from work for discrimination after receiving the wrong message sent by the mother saying that she was "another black man".
The couple denied the racists and claimed to be "useable".
The mother of two children Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman was surprised to learn that the new child supervisor Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on the first working day of 2016.
"NOEEEEEEEEE, AND ONE JUDGMENT," Mr Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in his letter.
But she was sent twice to her husband, but not twice, but to Mr. Maurice.
On the basis of the New York Post, the ignorant Plasco-Flaxman felt uncomfortable and fired from Mr. Maurice's work, claiming that the former afro-americite, who was ill did his work and instead hoped to meet the Filipinos.
Mr. Maurice was paid for one working day and was sent by a Uber car.
Now Maurice has given a couple to the court demanding compensation for forgiveness and seeks to adjust even after 350 USD a day for half a year and work at the client's home, for which she was originally hired even without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things cannot be done," she said on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination".
The couple turned away from charges of racism by denying it and claiming that Maurice's dismissal was reasonable because they feared that she would not be able to trust her after she was injured.
“My wife sent her what she did not want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasca.
"Would you trust your children to whom you were not married, even though it was a mistake?
Your new birth?
I don't know."
Plascas said that the wife was pregnant just two months ago and was “in a very difficult situation”.
Are you going to judge that?
This is not very nice behavior," added the investment banking specialist.
During the trial, the media tried to condemn a couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
New messages reveal that Paddington’s publishers are afraid that readers will not understand the tongue of the forest
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bonde, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to feel at another place, reading the book for the first time before it was released.
Now it's very interesting to know what we know about the enormous success of Paddington."
In saying that her father, who worked with the BBC operator before finding inspiration, would not have been too surprised if his work had been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the release of the book after his father’s death was pleasant and sad years ago.
Speaking of Paddington, which she describes as “a very important family member, ” she added that her father was quietly proud of his success.
"He was quite a quiet man and did not like to drink," she said.
“When Paddington was like him, he felt like he had a child who had achieved something: be proud of him, though it is not your job.
I think he similarly appreciated the success story of Paddington.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave his own reward to Paddington.
My daughter was worried, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter was released, she was quickly taken to Nicos Louis Pasteur’s 2 hospital, where doctors were unable to save her life.
“Nada kept calling and said that the situation was really bad, that she was not expected to survive,” said Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I received a call from Nado, who called to tell her that she had been living for two minutes and had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I told her: “Tashi, dear, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Doctors who supported her heart rate gradually ended up working and removed from the body.
She died a little while earlier, and it was the end of everything.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing that all of this is happening.
I couldn't fight, fight or fight because I was in the environment, surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it in my own hands."
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperous, now grieving his dead daughter, entered the plane along with other passengers who did not understand the difficult test she had to face.
"No one knew," she said.
“My head was crushed, and the tears began to flow all the time.
It's hard to explain why, but that's exactly why I felt great compassion for Nadu on the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's openers are designed to prevent suicides on the bridges
Two women who have lost their loved ones in death try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Wells Bridge distributes the openings with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that people can call and ask for help.
Mr. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he got depressed, and he killed him in the 18th.
"I don't want any father to feel like I have to feel every day," she said.
In the 45th century B.C.E., Dr. Davis said that her son was a very promising boss, separating from the crippling smile.
"All knew him about his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up the room."
However, he did work before his death, for he was “in the place of darkness. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother murdered.
Mr Davis said, "I am not afraid that a chain reaction can occur."
“ To make people know that there are people in the environment who can be approached and talked about, ” wrote Davis, “even if they are friends.
Don't sit still, you have to talk."
Mr. Humphrey, a longtime friend of Mr. Davies, died of his 15 - year - old partner, Mark, who left his life shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say that he felt depressed, overwhelmed by depression and did not complain," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his changed attitude.
During Christmas, the situation was completely bad: when the children invented their gift, he did not look into their eyes and did not respond at all."
She said that his death was a major trauma to them, but they had to overcome it: “In this case, it left empty.
That makes our hearts glad.
But we all have to live on and fight."

Following an FTB study, the future of Bretto Kavanaugh was changed to hair
I thought that if we could really get something he asked for — a study of a limited length and scope — we might have some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the Committee would be in the ranks of the third parties.
Why did the sponsors of Mr Kavanaugh and his Republics not want the FTB to start the investigation?
Their opposition is only a matter of time.
Until the mid-term elections, which will take place on 6 November, only five weeks remain and, if the Republicans are expected to appear to be poor, their efforts to select people to the highest court of the country will be much weaker.
George’s W. Bush called senators in an effort to convince them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and met his wife Ashley, former Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen when the FTB submits its report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will have a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh Senate can receive 50 votes to allow Vice-President Mike Pence to withdraw his contact and approve him to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserts in North Korea, when the government came into power, "was reduced"
The South Korean legislator said that the number of North Korean deserters to South Korea was reduced when Kim Jong-uns came into power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-segret, quoting data from the South Korean Union Ministry, said that 1 127 deserters had been identified last year compared to 2,706 deserts in 2011.
Mr Park said that the main factors were increased control of the North Korean and Chinese border and increased human smuggling prices.
Pchenjan did not make any public comments.
Most North Korean deserts are finally offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border in 1953.
Many fled across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers deserts to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them to their parents.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still being fought, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pchenjane, where negotiations on nuclear weapons had been closed.
This happened after the historic US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un's meeting in Singapore in June, when both agreed essentially that the Korean side would become a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
However, on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of not changing their sanctions from that time on.
"If there is no confidence in the US, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to fight unilaterally," said Mr Ri at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosios Brett Kavanaugh removes "sister" and claims that he does not deserve to serve at the Supreme Court
The representative's minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the candidate Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court judge and said that he did not deserve to serve at the Supreme Court for his temperament.
Mr Pelosi made these comments during an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival.
"I just cannot believe that if a woman did so, she would be said to be a woman," Mr Pelosi said in his response to the evidence given to the Senate's judicial committee on Thursday.
B. Kavanaugh was emotionally reluctant to accuse him of taking sexual assaults against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom were still teenagers.
During his introductory talk about family and high school times, B. Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes unbecoming or unscrupulous.
He also fully condemned the former democrats in the committee, who had accused him of being "a big disco and a coordinated destruction of reputation", which was not organised by the Liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton had lost his presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi argued that the evidence given by Mr Kavanaugh had shown that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he had revealed his country's attitude to the Democrats.
"I believe that he has discredited himself with his statements and the attack by the Clinton and the Democratic Party," she said.
The question was whether it was intended to eliminate Mr Kavanaugh, if his candidacy had been confirmed and the majority of votes received in the House of Representatives, Mr Pelosi objected.
“I will say so – if he is lying to Congress or the FTB, it is not proper to go to the Supreme Court, but also to the court where he is working now,” said Mr Pelosi.
Currently, Mr Kavanaugh is the judge of the Court of Appeal of the District of Colombia.
Mr Pelosi added that she was concerned about the possible decisions made by Mr Kavanaugh on the current Health Care Act or the Roe v Wade case because he was considered a conservative lawyer.
During the approval meetings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether to withdraw certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for us to become a judge on the east side of the country: "How wonderful!" said Mr Pelosi.
Possible for women to use
This is a legitimate criticism: finally, months and even years of accumulated tension, which it cannot express without tears.
"When we are confused, we pray," after 45 years, the Panel told me.
"I don't think it's an unusual thing, do you?"
She went on to say: “One woman, the head of a company, helped me very much by saying that she also suffered when she died, but she developed a certain method: I was beaten, and she said to the man with whom you were talking at the time: ‘ You may think I’m sorry, because I’m crying.
I'm really mad."
And she just went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Ashras is considered to be an acceptable expression of anger partly because it is basically misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is from one of the first jobs in which the men worked most and where I started to cry once because of the insatiable insomnia, and then I was the older woman in the trunk, and the manager, who was always a little nervous, pushed me up the stairs.
"Never let them see your torment," he told me.
- They don't know you're in.
They think you're sick, so you'll be happy to beat you."
Democratic Party Congressman from Colorado Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Harts was captured by a stranger on the Monkey Business (aforism, which means an easy time) and withdrew the candidacy, after deeply disappointed Mr. Schroeder decided that there was no reason why he could not apply to the president himself.
“This was not a good idea,” he said after 30 years.
– There were seven other candidates at the time, so there was no need for one more.
Someone called me "Snow with seven noodles."
Later, after the campaign, there was little time left to raise funds, so she promised not to announce the candidacy until she made $2 million.
It was an unparalleled struggle.
She noticed that some sponsors, offering $1,000 to men, only 250.
“Did they think that I was getting discount?” she said.
The language in which it was announced that it started a formal campaign included emotions such as gratitude for people, a system of despair that made it very difficult to collect money and to reach voters directly, not representatives, and the anger of sexism, that it was a rumor.
“You would have remembered that I was nervous,” recalled Mrs Schroeder, who had responded to her speech.
– You'd think I'd be supported by the Kleenex server business.
I remember thinking what's going to be in my grave's memory.
"Did you hear?"
How the US and China Trade Can Be Useful for Beijing
The U.S. and Chinese trade wars have been created, and although the battle has not yet ended well, experts say that the long-term disadvantage can be beneficial to Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Shortas gave the first warning this year of the earlier taxable main products exported by China, including solar elements, steel and aluminium.
The strongest opposition took place this week, when new tariffs on goods with a value of $200 billion (150 billion) were in force, i.e. a substantial part of Chinese exports to the United States will be taxed.
The price of all the measures was the same as the most recent decision on US goods with a total value of $60 billion from five to ten per cent of the duty.
China has sworn to fight US teeth for teeth, and it seems that this second world market is not really going to get worse in the near future.
Washington's sanctions would only be mitigated if China complied with the requirements, but the US would be too vulnerable to China's President Xi Jinpingui.
However, experts say that, if Beijing properly destroys its party, the difficulties of the US war on trade may have a long-term positive impact on China, as it will reduce the interdependence of these markets.
"The sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for the economy of both countries is in fact far more dangerous than observers have so far recognized," said Abigail Grace, a member of the research institute, Asia's New American Security Centre.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is ready to accept returning refugees
Syria claims to prepare for voluntary return of refugees and requests for assistance in restoring a country that has been killed in war for more than 7 years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walidas al-Moualemas said conditions are improving in the country.
"As a result of progress in combating terrorism, the situation in the territory has become much more stable and safer," he said.
The government continues to seek to restore the damaged areas of the terrorists and restore the normal situation.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they have had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions directed against daily life and well-being have already been established.
Since the start of the war, the United Nations has left Syria about 5.5 million cheeses.
Humanitarian aid is needed for six million people living in the country.
Al-Moualema said that the Syrian regime would be pleased to accept assistance in restoring the country.
However, it also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from the countries supporting the rise.
Europe abolished the victory of the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team, following the final U.S. team score 16,5:10,5, won the Ryder Cup in 2018 at Le Golf National Square near Paris (France).
The U.S. has lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in this country since 1993.
Europe returned to the crown when the Danish-born captain Thomas Bjorn's team gathered 14.5 points, which were used to defeat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mikkelson, who had a hard time at the whole tournament, launched a blow from the starting site directly into the water, slid the 16th-day match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian player F. Molinari caught sight in all rounds and became one of the four players who scored 5-0-0 since 1979 when the tournament won the current form.
American Jordan Speed 5:4 won the lowest ranking European team player Thorbjørnas Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranking Dustin Johnson 2:1 lost the English to Ian Poulter, who may have played his last tournament of the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia of the eight tournaments of the Ryder Tournament became the most successful European player of all time, gathering 25.5 career points.
"I really do, but I can't manage today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Mr Thomas that he chose me and believed me.
I'm very happy, very happy to get the cup back.
It's all up to the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," said Mr. Garcia after the European victory.
He transmits the staphyte to his father John Ramu, who in the game of Sunday units 2:1 pulverized the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods.
"I am unbelievably proud of the victory of Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him play," Rahmas said 23 years old.
Woods lost all four of his cats in France and now belongs to him 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
This changes the statistics to one of the best players of all time, the winner of the 14 biggest prizes and the one that only sends to Jack Nicklaus.
For the US team all weekend failed to get into the heating bay, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated a high-level game during the entire tournament.
“ I am proud of these men, ” said Captain Jim Furyk, after the dejected team.
There was a moment this morning when we started printing Europeans.
We're stuck.
I'm taking my hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Council Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to put your head down.
Our enemies were more infrequent."
