Members of the National Assembly for Wales are afraid of confusion with the Muppets
In the case of some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to amend their title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Wallisian Parliament).
The purpose of this is to amend the name of the National Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
National Assembly members of all political directions fear becoming the target of the spot.
One member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly said that his group was concerned because the name ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’ is covered.
For non-valisive readers: In Welsh there is "twp" for "doof" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A national assembly member of Plaid Cymru stated that the whole group was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the change of name, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the walysic letter w is spoken in the English language spoken in Yorkshire, similar to the letter u.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Committee), which is currently drafting a law on the name change, said: "The final decision on the names of the members of the National Assembly is of course with the members themselves."
The government of Wales Act of 2017 enabled the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Board published the results of a public hearing on the proposals from which broad support for the name ‘Welsh Parliament’ was drawn up for the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly, the board of Welsh Parliament members or WMPs preferred the largest support during a public hearing.
The National Assembly members seem to propose alternative options, but the call for a consensus for President Elin Jones, who should present a draft legislation within weeks, could be a problem.
The Law on Reforms will contain further changes in the way in which the National Assembly is working, including rules on the disqualification of members of the National Assembly and on the design of the Committee system.
The members of the national assembly may finally vote on their names in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum was set up to wage a decade-long dispute with the neighbouring Greek country, which has a province with similar name Macedonia.
Athens has long known that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim is raised in the Greek territory, and has repeatedly spoken against its inclusion in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not acknowledge the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name of accession to the EU and NATO is the price to be paid.
The bells of St. Martin's give way to the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner," Adams said.
"Today there are both no more."
He said the disappearance of the bars was detectable.
"People's social life looks different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood in which people are regularly located."
He fears that the money from the sale of assets does not last as long as the church leaders assume, and that they will “be at the beginning sooner or later”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with property apartments in which people live who do not support the remaining resorts.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy properties in these buildings will be white," he said, "and in order to accelerate the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who enter these properties will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community came out in the 1930s.
A black community that took up their services in the vicinity became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who launched a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem, who refused to set up or support blacks.
At a fire in 1939, the building was badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's community members planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly referred to the bell game as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the bell game in July used other words: "a cultural treasure" and "a non-legislative historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first world-wide bell game played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. It was changed 18 years ago to the largest bell game in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in the last few months in St. Martin's is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been brought up in part by the lay leaders of the church and in part by the bishop diocese.
In July, the board of directors of the community, which was composed of lay leaders, expressed written concerns about the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the community board, although it was not involved in the commission of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the community complain about lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Hai injured 13-year-olds in California when diving to Lobstern
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the season of the Lobster season, according to official statements, a 13-year-old boy has attacked a shark in diving to Lobstern.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the broadcaster KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been with friends for about half an hour on the dive on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry of help and rode with several others to the boy to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he had first thought that the boy was happy to have caught a praiser. But then he realized that the boy shouted, “I’ve been bitten!
I've been bitten!".
When Hamel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire cell bone had been broken up.
“I write that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was fled to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego and is in a critical state.
The nature of the Hais responsible for the attack was unknown.
The rescue pain Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier. However, it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials stopped for investigation purposes and for security reasons 48 hours the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Encinitas.
According to Giles, there are over 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks cosmetic departments that are used to shop houses with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and Debenhams.
In the context of a major breakthrough in the UK's 2.8 billion global cosmetic market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow, while fashion and budget revenues decrease, the larger cosmetic divisions will be tested across the country in eleven branches. If they prove to be successful, they will be extended to other branches in the coming year.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to the search for supermarkets to make different use of charging surfaces used for television, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, the scope of its cosmetic offer is doubled for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also available series of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees receive more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like boats.
In addition, the supermarket conducts a relaunch of its makeup series "Boutique" so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly required by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test in two Sainsbury's branch sales outlets. The first sales outlet was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and a second one will be opened during the next year in Sely Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local supplies means that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, sales outlets will increasingly look like shops, as the supermarket chain with more services and non-food items will try to fight the discounter Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has established a number of habitat sales outlets since the purchase of the chain Argos and Habitats two years ago in hundreds of branches of Argos sales outlets and also increased the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, but ended after a dispute over the distribution of proceeds from the drug dealer's branch offices in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 affiliates to Celesio, the owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million British pounds three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds would play a role in the plan when an extended palette with luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, was added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Managing Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our cosmetic departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in highly educated colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand palette is tailored to all needs. Because of the lockdown environment and the favourable locations, we are now an attractive goal for cosmetic purchases, which is inquiring of the previous type of purchase."
Peter Jones "suffering" after Holly Willoughby's retreat from a business worth 11 million British pounds
"Dragons' Star Peter Jones is "suffering", after TV moderator Holly Willoughby has returned from a business worth 11 million UK pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand True.
The two were compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Mark Goop.
The "This Morning" moderator, 37, announced their withdrawal to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby crushed "Dragons' The" Star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on her own new connection agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was to be "suffering" as the "Golden Girl" of television during an intense discussion on Tuesday at the center of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, added, due to its new business – in the value of up to 1.5 million British pounds – the common homewear and accessories brand Truely can no longer devote enough time.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Mark Goop and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million British pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from True at Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to one of his holiday resorts.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly at a distance.
It should ensure their long-term future over the next decades.
Their decision to withdraw was quite surprising for all the parties.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the introduction of the market.
In the center of Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" moderator, which is one of Britain's most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investment in products from kisses and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in the introduction of the market.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been closely associated with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truely in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, came in March as president.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40% share of Baldwins TV production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as moderator of the ITV broadcast "I'm A Celebrity".
A nearby source of Jones said last night: "We do not comment on his business matters."
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He complained about the criticism he would have received from the news media for a comment that some would view as 'non-presidential' and expected such positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said that the voice of a news moderator follows:
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the first meeting in Singapore in June was celebrated as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on denuclearisation have come to the fore.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the top North Korea diplomat, said on Saturday to leading politicians from all over the world on the occasion of the UN General Assembly that the North did not see any “consistent reaction” of the United States to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he identified, the United States imposed sanctions that should maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We faced a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: the end of the rocket tests, support in the release of hostages and the re-overcoming of the mortal remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of speaking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, showing the crowd directly to him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastated an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the earthquake of Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok have been displaced, no national level has been declared as a prerequisite for the mobilization of international aid.
"In many cases they have made it very clear that they do not require international support, so this is something difficult," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children prepares a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work on the spot.
Sutopo, spokesperson of the disaster protection authority, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu as to whether international actors should participate in the aid measures.
In view of the earthquakes with which Indonesia has a constant struggle, the country is still being prepared to deal with natural violence in a deplorable way.
While in Aceh Tsunami protection events were built, these are not daily sights on other coastal strips.
Despite a warning in force, apparently missing tsunamis in Palu have probably contributed to the deaths.
Travels between Indonesia and many islands already pose a challenge in the best case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A Lazaret ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new catastrophe in three days earlier.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the proposed Indonesian infrastructure for the core of his campaign and has made a lot of money for roads and railways.
However, the government of the next year's re-election suffers from financing deficits.
Joko is also under pressure from constant confessional tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of their homes and homes were expelled, when bands of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with Mackenzies, arrows and bows, as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at the London Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a premium league loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 back stand of his team in about 27 meters away from the door of Chelsea.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot him towards the back of the pop.
The shooter was sailing high above the sternum and drove to the right upper corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I just tried to get in this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much as possible forward, so I just tried to make as much time as possible for me,” Sturridge said against LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came to see edge and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just accepted the shot."
Chelsea led after a hit in the 25th minute through the Belgian Star Eden Hazard for a half-time with 1:0.
The blues-stormer gave a pass with the verse back to Mateo, then turned off near the middle field and sprinkled into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle field.
Then he took a good break, so Hazard arrived in the courtroom.
Hazard left the defender behind and locked up with a left-wing squad at Liverpool's Alison Becker past the net.
Liverpool plays at the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples.
Chelsea stands at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London at UEFA Europe League Videoton.
The number of Tsunamis deaths in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of deaths of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, as reported by the disaster protection authority on Sunday morning.
Many people were to be caught in the ruins of buildings, which were brought to the ground by the earthquake of the Force 7.5 on Friday, which had triggered up to six metres high waves, the public speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was translated with the ruins of broken buildings.
Police take man, 32, for murder suspicion, after a woman has been raped
After finding a female corpse this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder suspicion.
The police ask the residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask everyone who has stayed close to John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask all the persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have entered something with a Dashcam, to contact us. They may have information that is of utmost importance for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
Today afternoon, friends who believe in the woman are in the tator to explore where she was found this morning.
The investigation was under way, and the police informed her that she was informing the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get to his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was silent when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours to enter the building again.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a tator.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
She always repeats, "that's so terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the lockdown and another vehicle before the lockdown.
Several police officers were in the lockdown who were watching the housing block.
People who have information will be asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers under number 0800 555 111 anonymous and to refer to protocol entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell stand before Parliament will be the latest topic of the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their bond would be poetic justice for its destruction to the Taliban of so many cultural and religious art products of England by its fanatic Puritan adherents.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "tority" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the image of Oliver Cromwell was set as a target in front of the Palace of Westminster.
The image tower in the English Civil Wars was neither organized nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have sacrificed for the deeds of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence to be celebrated for the 19th century's dominant opinion and part of the historical writing of a figure that is still valuable to many.
Goldsmith said regarding the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is being defended by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century, more than today than anyone who considers Parliament to be against pressure from outside, in his case, of course by the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully relevant presentation is the subject of further historical debates.
It is certain that in the middle of the 17th century the conflict formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this scourge.
Its services as Lord's Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, to whom only the last name "Yuan" was named, was found with a separated bloodstream artery near a pigyard on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou dead, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject pigs vaccines in the province of Qinghai, China on 30 May 2005.
According to reports, on Wednesday, he and his cousin from neighboring Yunnan traveled to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door was open to a nearby pigyard.
He said that in the stable a large male pig with blood was found on the snout.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that the 250 kilos of heavy pigs had consumed the farmers.
"The legs of my cousins were bloodthirsty and stung," was quoted by Guiyang Evening News, the cousin to whom the last name was called "Wu".
Recordings of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man belonged neither to Yuan nor to his cousin.
One market manager said the Evening News, the pig was blocked to prevent attacks on other people, while the police collected evidence at the Tatort.
Yuan's family and market authorities negotiate reports on compensation for his death.
Although it is rare that pigs attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-kilogram heavy pig caught a whale farmer between himself and a tractor until the woman of the farmer was able to swallow the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said against CBC News that pigs were usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as "solvent".
“They are just played.
They like to wander and they're very curious, ... they're not about to hurt someone.
You only have to treat them with the right measure of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread strong rains to the South West of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens on the way over the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring raining floods to North Mexico and the South West of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 p.m., Rosa opened wind speeds of 136 km/h, corresponding to a category 1 Hurricane, and was 620 kilometres south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific begins to form a Trough, which leads east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical humidity is transported north into the Southwest of the United States.
Rosa is triggered on Monday in parts of Mexico up to 25 centimeters of precipitation.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical humidity produces a wide range of strong rainfalls in the south-west due to interactions with the rising trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous fluctuations, water-driving protection and possibly soil in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west, in particular in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation is expected.
Due to the fluctuation of tropical precipitation, the possibility of fluctuating floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions is present.
In view of the threatening tropical defeats, it is urgent to step into the desert.
Strong defeats can result in canyon-driving currents, and winds bring local winds as well as wind, the dust leads with it.
The nearby Trog brings strong rains to parts of the coast of southern California.
It is possible to have a total impact of more than a centimeter, which can lead to a low level of protection in the water and smooth roads.
This would be the first defeat of the rainy season in this region.
The first isolated tropical rain shows reach Arizona on Sunday and Monday. On Monday and Tuesday it rains.
On Tuesday, strong rains spread into the Four-Corners region and stopped on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States as the Arctic cools, while the valleys remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example in the middle of the United States of America for drastic temperature differences.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the constant summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the central and eastern United States, a warmer October beginning with wide temperatures is expected at 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of excessive temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
Over 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million viewers have seen on Thursday at six television networks the festive statements by Brett Kavanaugh and the woman Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political Pattis situation began. On Friday, television broadcasters interrupted their regular program due to a change in the last minute: a deal negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, and the FBI should therefore conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Justice Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party, she had stressed and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure this didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company detected the average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that had broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring viewing numbers in offices.
To reverse this in the right perspective: This corresponds to, for example, the number of spectators in a play-off football game or in the Oscar award.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, listed Nielsen with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the entire day's hearing the highest numbers of all networks.
ABC came to second place with 3.26 million spectators.
According to data from Nielsen 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest continued to grow after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had published a statement that he would therefore vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by CNN and CBS, as protestors in the chair on the way to a hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stood for minutes with a gentle look while he was trained. The scene was transferred live at CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you believe that he tells the country the truth?"
"They have power, while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement and added before the chair concluded that he would have more to say in the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks sent live hours later than the Justice Committee should vote on the continuation of the appointment of Kavanaughs to the whole Senate.
Flake said, however, that he would do this only on the condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, would investigate the charges against the candidates next week.
Flake was partly convinced by insults with a friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subjugation with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes without the investigation for the confirmation of Kavanaugh.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges brought against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May accused in an interview with the Sunday Times critics of their plans for the withdrawal from the European Union, of using the future of Britain for political purposes and of undermining the interests of the nation.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet on September 29, 2018 at the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
In addition to an interview with her on the title page of the newspaper, other interviews published by her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called "Checkers Plan" for Brexit by means of a proposal that provides for the mutual entry of duties by the United Kingdom and the EU as "totally absurd".
Killed shots on Wayde Sims: Police take Suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the LSU player's death
In connection with the deadly shots on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU), the police arrested a suspect.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested according to the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities published video recordings of the conflict between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reported, the police assured the glasses at the tator and said that Simpson's DNA was found at the glasses.
After an interrogation, Simpsons told the police that he had stood the deadly shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gun on the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the criminal lab of the state police, the Southern University Police and the citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement authority for "their care and their pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m big bird player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season he achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach of LSU, Will Wade, said that the team was "deeply frightened" and "stand under shock".
"For this, you're always scared," Wade said.
Vulcan comes ash in Mexico City.
Asche designed by the Volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity was increased in the crater and 183 gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of strikes and injuries.
Pictures in social media showed thin ash sheets on the windshields of cars in quarters of Mexico City, for example Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have established, since September 2017, an earthquake of 7.1 central Mexico, increased activity at the 72 kilometres south-east of the capital volcano.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between the police and Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six persons were arrested on Saturday after clashes between the preparedness police and the pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands took part in other demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the polarising independence reference in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, who were detained by the preparedness police, buried them with eggs and also smeared colour powder, so that dark dust clouds emerged in the streets normally inhabited by tourists.
In the course of the next day, there was also hand-held with the police who used their bullets to stop the fights.
Several hours of scandalous pro-independence groups "Don't forget, don't forgive", when they faced Unionists who called "long live Spain".
As local press reported, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in protests.
However, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which was seen by Madrid as illegal, by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had decided by overwhelming majority on independence, although the electoral participation was low, as the dissidents boycotted most of the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the Wahllokals.
Pro-independence groups had camped in the open on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to take another path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatists' protest, said he saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, no more with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out of joy because they could choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
In spite of an important, though notable, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulties maintaining the momentum this year. Many of their most well-known leaders are either in exile or in prison, where they await their procedures because of their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said the conflict was cut by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in investigation since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best way to reduce democratic values and suppress oppression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after the car house was destroyed
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been built by a car several times.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, it may have been shot on the car with an armbrush.
Menga hit means for Livingston 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengas's first gate for Livingston won the victory.
The uplifted Livingstone FC surprised the rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas hits proved crucial to Gary Holt's team being able to compete with hibernian in the second half of the year.
Gerard's team stays in the premiere during this season without a victory outside and is facing the hearts that are eight points behind the next Sunday.
Earlier on Thursday, the rangers in the Europa League are hosts for Rapid Vienna.
In the meantime, Livingstone can increase its victory series in the division to six games, which means that Chief Trainer Holt has not yet recorded a defeat since his acquisition of Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against freely playing guests
Holt's team should have been in charge for a long time before the hit, as its directness put the Rangers in the face of the various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, however, slowed down before the door. Then Alan Lithgov could only shoot far after he was here to meet Craig Halket's head shot at the door.
The hosts agreed to let the Rangers play ahead, as they knew that they could prevent the guests in standard situations.
In this way, the decisive gate was standing.
The Rangers left a free shot, and Livingstone prepared a chance to bring the Declan Gallagher and Robinson Menga together in a shooting position. This shot the door with a ball contact from the center of the scene.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but they could not overcome the resistance of the host, and Torhüter Liam Kelly remained largely indifferent.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly had to defend himself once.
Scott Pittman was rejected by the Rangers-Torhütter Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgov slammed the ball from another standard situation of Livingstone.
Flanen has always come back to the scene of Livingstone and has been regularly taken out of the danger area, while two required fines – one from a necklace against the confused Glenn Middleton and one because of a handplay – have been refused.
"Phenomenal" by Livingstone – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingstone.
They were excellent without exception and have again exceeded the expectations of this upward trend.
Her playing habits and her team have barely changed since they returned to the top teams, but Holt has paid a great praise for the way he has guarded the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worall were on the job throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As well as they were under Gerrard in time, they could not reach this standard.
Her last ball was not enough – only once they were able to pass through the host team – and this is something like a weekend call for the rangers in the middle of the table.
Receive Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), smiling faces and blue sky ruled when the government chief of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and EU accession to Turkey.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called security reasons for holding a 25,000 people strong enough to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters came in close to see their presidents.
Hundreds of anti-erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also became heard. They condemned Erdogan's politics as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, which is praised by some German Turks as heroes and mocked by others as autocrats.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Cycling killed by car crash
With a car crash, a bike driver was killed in London.
The crash took place around 10:15 a.m. in British summer time near the crossing of Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic-rich road in Deptford in the southeastern part of the city.
The driver stopped the car, and the ambulances took care of the man who died in the accident.
Months before the accident, another bike driver had come to life in an accident with a driver's flight in the Children Street, about 1.6 kilometers from the accident from Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and notify his next family.
Road closures and routes for buses are set up, and drivers have been made to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six officers injured in unrest
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in unrest in a prison for men.
The unrest broke out on Sunday around 9:30 a.m. British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and continued.
Specialized "Tornado" officers were added to end the disturbances involving eight seats and restricted to one wing.
The officials were treated locally for minor injuries in the face.
One spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “It was specially trained prison personnel to resolve a still ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we want to make it clear that the police are being handed over and maybe spending longer behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison manager was treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, officials were sent to prison to deal with serious disturbances in which the staff were attacked with pools.
Hurrika Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with floating overswimmings (may be profiting areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa take over the southwests marked by deserts and bring the risk of fluctuating floods with them.
The National Weather Service has already issued alerts against air currents on Monday and Tuesday from west of Arizona to south and east of Nevada, as well as to the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to get closer to rain on Monday night and on Tuesday directly across Phoenix.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have come near as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a Hurricane within 64 kilometres of Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation with a single size of up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west, including central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and combined in total up to 10 centimeters.
For those who do not have the risk of fluctuating floods, the floods associated with Rosa may be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, these rains are likely to be useful in part because they are now in the south-west of Dürre.
According to the U. S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is entering at least extreme holes, the second highest category," said weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane means that Rosa will meet on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have herring strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometres per hour and will be 620 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Afterwards, the Hurricane will move 19 kilometres per hour to the north.
In the Pacific, the storm will meet on colder water and thus weaken.
Therefore, it is expected that Rosa will meet on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on the ground.
The precipitation can occur in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora desert, precipitations of 7.5 to 15 centimeters are expected, with up to 25 centimeters possible," said weather.com.
Then, Rosa will be drawn as a tropical storm in the north direction of Mexico, on the early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression reaching the border of Arizona and then by the late Saturday through Arizona to the top in the south of Utah.
“As a major risk, very strong defeats are expected in connection with Rosa or her remains in Baja California, the north-west of the Sonora Desert and the south-west of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center reported.
As a result of these downfalls, Earthquakes are expected to be found in the deserts of life-threatening flooding and in the water-driving protection as well as in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After the end of a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three boys were arrested in their teens and a 20-year-old man under the suspicion of attempted murder.
The teen was found injured on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
The officials asked everyone who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered "under the community, the wrath" of the Democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the skrupulous and unheard tactics of the Democrats," Trump said at a news conference in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered during the entire nomination process "under the community, the anger" of the Democrats.
Kavanaugh said on Thursday before the Congress and returned the charge raised by Christine Blasey Ford, he had sexually harassed them decades ago, when both teenagers were.
Ford also stated in the hearing that he had been charged with.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw this day the Brillanz, the quality and the courage of Kavanaugh.
"A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in the service of the public," he said the number of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not going in, but I'm actually going in," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission to "resist and block".
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place at the latest on Friday in the Senate, a senior member of the GOP leadership said against CNN.
Hundreds of earthquakes killed in Indonesia, victims rising
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were hunted by a strong earthquake and a tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi by giant waves on the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu, when up to six meters high waves struck on the beach, causing many people to rise to death and destroy everything that was in their way.
The Tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of the magnitude of 7.5.
"When the threat came through the tsunami yesterday, people were still on the beach, and they did not get caught up immediately, and they fell victim to him," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Disaster Protection Authority BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
"The Tsunami did not come alone, he swam cars, wooden stables and houses with, he hit the ground with everything," Nugroho said. He added that the Tsunami had been dragged over the open sea at 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
Some people on the flight before the tsunami were climbing on trees and had survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and kept in 24 centres in Palu.
Many destroyed buildings and shops, fenced and destroyed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water, were published by the crash protection authority.
On Saturday, the coastal city was excavated by other descendants.
The earthquake series was to be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the massive energy released from Friday was the 200th aspect of the energy emitted by the Second World War on Hiroshima.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have increased, the authorities said.
Nugroho described the damage as “absolute” and stated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found among the ruins of damaged buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said the number of victims and the damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the baby.
The communication with Dongala was completely broken by the words of Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," said the statement.
On Saturday, the Authority was often criticized for not informing her that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves reportedly received official information at the time of the warning.
In social media, amateur recordings show a man on the top floor of a building who despairs with calls the people on the street beneath him in front of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes a water wall enters the shore and swims out of buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately check the authenticity of the recordings.
Through the Bebe and the tsunami, there was a massive power drop that disrupted the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities with support, but the evacuations still need food and other vital goods.
The airport of the city remains closed until October and has only been reopened for aid measures.
For Sunday a visit was planned by President Joko Widodo in evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of Tsunami victims has increased to over 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Dondgala reached the city of Palu, where the employees were held in tent halls in the interior of their office, but came to the words of Dosebas on the way to scenes of desertification.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the aid groups began with the hard task of putting the disaster relief in progress, some had demonstrated that experts from abroad would be prevented on their journey to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible if the site of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened so far.
"At the moment it is still a disaster on the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'okay, this is a national disaster', we can accept international support.
While the second night since the earthquake and tsunami fell from Friday over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing people hoped for them on one of the wonders that brought some light to the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue forces release a woman who had been beaten for two days by drummers next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian Paragliding National Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the beginning of this month in Indonesia at the end of the Asian games.
Others who were imprisoned in Roa-Roa-Hotel, as Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon related how in the hours after the message from the Roa-Roa-Hotel's tour under the paraglids made the rounds, whatsapp news had been sent to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach party.
However, his messages only led to gray questions instead of blue hooks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Diebe steal 26.750 US dollars while filling in a cash machine in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release by the Newport police, on Friday morning, Newport on the Levee Diebe stole an employee from Brink’s while filling in a cash machine 26.750 US dollars.
The driver of the vehicle had learned a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to deposit more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, "a man came behind the staff of Brink's" and stole a bag full of money that was intended for the machines.
According to the press release, several suspects fled the tator. However, the police did not tell how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information on the identity of suspects will be asked to contact the Newport police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
At the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The Beings officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been the peak Ye for some time and has used it as the title of its eight albums published in June.
The change takes place at Saturday Night Live, where the publication of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He acts as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has given up "emotional reasons".
The word is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it has religious significance, according to its own statement, for the West.
“I believe that “ye” is the most common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “du”, said West this year in a conversation about his album with Radiomoderator Big Boy.
"I'm you, I'm us, we are.
From Kanye, which means “the only” only “Yes” – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, by all.
The album reflects on what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with the West, has already written his name with and without string and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military violence against the civilian population, while the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country is approaching.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers had fired a peaceful demonstration on the scene and killed 300 people. At that time, left-handed students were moving to establish themselves in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans through monthly student assistance and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training led to young criminal gangs.
US should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's enhanced activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research expenditure in this field, says investor and KI practitioners Kai-Fu Lee, who was active in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow KI announcements from different areas of the US government, even if the US generally lacks a formal KI strategy.
In the meantime China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become the No. 1 in the area of KI innovation by 2030.
"The duplication of the KI research budget would be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the USA, we are looking for the next KI breakthrough," Lee said.
The duplication of financial resources could double the chances that the next major success in the US would be achieved, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Synovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on a KI system that won the highest-ranking U.S. Othello player. Later he was the leading leader of Microsoft Research and President of the Google Netherlands in China.
Lee appreciated previous technology competitions of the US government such as the Robotics Challenge of Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked after the date of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to read, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"China does not take away the academic superiors, but the companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have set up corypheus in recent years from universities to work at KI.
According to Lees, an amended immigration policy in the USA could also be supportive of the US's KI efforts.
"I think that in the area of KI promotion, Greencards should be offered automatically," he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of KI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lees, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances people in academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the US Ministry of Defence founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to be involved in the partner of industry and science. The White House also announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month the investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million annually in the KI research.
In the meantime, U.S. laws on the education of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence have done nothing for months.
Macedonians agree in the referendum on a change of country name
The population of Macedonia agreed on Sunday in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed in "the Republic of Northern Macedonia", which would have been a decade of old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that it raises this claim in the Greek territory. Therefore, Greece has put a veto against Macedonia's inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. Nationalist opponents argue, however, that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign raises doubts as to whether the election will reach the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the voting list was: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU through the adoption of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belongs, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth the price in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union, as this means a safe life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they would stick to the result so that it is decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said it had no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the vote was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of registered voters voting.
"I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, gave their vote in the referendum on the change of country name, which Macedonia would open the way to accession to NATO and to the European Union on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs to tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we would like to join the high level, not through the back entrance," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonians, we can join others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will result in urgent investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that there will be a large majority for this because more than 80 per cent of our citizens for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
According to him, a 'yes' result would be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote with "yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, the vote must be at 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first difficult battle for the politics of the provincial government since its takeover in May.
View: Sergio Aguero by Manchester City maneuvered by the entire Brighton rebellion to reach the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling passed on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester at the 2nd victory of Manchester City.
Aguero made his hit in the 65th minute look ridiculously easy.
The Argentine attacker was given a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton fighters and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green triangles.
He played around a defender and then took over several other defenders on the edge of Brighton's punishment.
Then he shot a pass to the left of Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the courtroom to play the ball back to Aguero, which with his right shoe Brighton-Torhüter Mathew Ryan and shot to the right side of the network.
"Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola against reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he got a door right now."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This door fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball at this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good score pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker aimed the ball into the net just before he went out.
City plays in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim v. Hoppenheim.
Scherzer wants to destroy the rockies game
Since the nationals are excluded from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force another use.
However, the always powerful Scherzer hopes to stand on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies on the hill, but only if this is relevant to the Rockies that have a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, for the Playoffs.
The Rockies achieved at least one wild card with a 5:2 victory over the nationals on Friday night, but they still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play at all, we can at least throw away because we know the atmosphere in the audience here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not participate in this competition?"
Nationals have not yet announced a starting player for Sunday, but according to reports, they are inclined to leave jokes in such a situation.
Scherzer, for which this was the 34th use as a starting player, practiced in the Bulgarian on Thursday and would throw it on his normal rest day on Sunday.
Washington's right hand has this season a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 inches.
Trump stops advertising in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation in connection with the Brett Kavanaugh, whom he elected for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“All we have done is in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our lives.
That's one of the big, big ones – I don't come in, but I actually come in, so I fight everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it now.
And they're determined to take power again with all their means, you see the community, the despicability.
It is not for them who hurt them, who must overcome them in order to obtain power and control, that is what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission as "to resist and block".
"And you will see it in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "angrily and incitingly and indiscriminately and indiscriminately".
He called it the highest-ranking democracy in the Senate's Justice Committee, Senator Diane Feinstein, which triggered a riot in the audience.
“Do you agree with her answer?
Did you get the document outside?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, no, I'm waiting for you one – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer applicable to all opinions.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party agreed to beat me, this came a little surprised.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members to whom it is said that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly, since she had strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised by the table application for having a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, of ironically similar issues that Jeremy and former top politicians did not have in mind.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "the meetings should all be inclusive and productive".
Most of the GC meetings in my eight-year-olds as local Labour Agents were exactly that.
Unfortunately, most meetings today are not marked by this tone, and the promised "friendly, more friendly" policy has been forgotten for a long time since it started at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion will then be assessed whether it is accepted by the party's point of view.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a party leader. My colleagues, with whom I previously believed to share similar political views, now expected me to make a conversion and take up positions with which I would otherwise never have agreed – whether in terms of national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – while it doesn’t matter what I say – there’s a period of skiing in the social media, which calls for my selection, the political centre, and says that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am doing better than some of my colleagues, because the comments that have been made to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who are facing a daily flow of seismic or racist abuses and yet never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that abuses have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn called last week for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we no longer allow all opinions to be taken into account, and with each motion for adjournment and any amendment to the rules of the election, the party will be more committed.
In the last two years, I have often been able to raise my head and not express my opinion so clearly, and then I would be "no problem".
But I didn't go into politics.
Since 32 years ago, as a student, I have been motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because my classrooms in the whole school have literally joined the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – as a community as well as as the Cabinet Minister.
I've never made a hero out of my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be in the dark about my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the Friday application that, given the fact that the country will fall too short of a Brexit, the households, companies and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I do not address this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my electors, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that I will not be deprived of so many threats or political intentions of acting in my opinion of the best interest of all of you.

Ayr versus Melrose 38:17: Unbeatable Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr won the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tannent's Premiership.
They are now the only ten teams unbeatable at the top of the table.
Last but not least, the success of the home team was due to its over-debt as well as to its better use of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been put to the test in our games so far, and we are still unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie von Melrose said: "Recognition for Ayr, they have made better use of their chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Climo, led by Ayr. However, due to a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, was able to let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot began an unprecedented attempt.
Climo built the leadership of Ayr with a penalty step before he achieved a hit directly in half time and then achieved an increased attempt alone, so it was for Ayr to pause 17:5.
Melrose, however, began the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was raised by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Then it came to a longer interruption due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, which was carried from the playing field. After the continuation, Ayr built his advantage by an increased attempt by Climo by Stafford McDowall.
Then, as Captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again Melrose paid the additional man at the end of a period of enormous pressure by a non-extensive attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card without a ball against Climo, MacPherson achieved a touchdown from the penalty gas behind the leading Ayr package.
Climo has increased almost since the breakup, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong's box kick was arrested and Flying Player Gregor Henry sent for the fifth attempt of the home team.
Still Game Star seems ready for new careers in gastronomy
"Still Game" Star Ford Kieran appears to be ready for a change in hospitality after it turned out to be the manager of a licensed restaurant.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC release, whose spin books he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his longtime Comedy Partner Greg Hemhill.
The two have announced that the leading nine staff will be the last of the shipment, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the managing director of Aföringmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one of the Scottish Sun's sources suggested that Kiernan was interested in raising "floating restaurant business" in Glasgow.
'The sea belongs to us': Bolivia, including the country, hopes that a court will open the way for peace
Matrosen patrol the marine capital quarter in La Paz, decorated with Tauwerk.
In public buildings there is a more blue flag.
Fleets from Titicacasee to Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our legal property.
It is a duty to win back."
Throughout the country, Bolivia is still alive as much as the desire to travel over the Pacific once again in a bloody conflict with resources lost to Chile in the 19th century.
These hopes may not be as strong as for decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court of Justice, which should be held on 1 October following five years' consultations.
"Bolivia has the tendency, a spirit of unity and peace and expects the result of a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Throughout the country, many Bolivians are following the decision of the IGH on large screens, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide for the benefit of Bolivia's demand. According to this, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea after decades of sporadic talks.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who next year advocates a controversial fight for his re-election, there is also much at stake in the judgment on Monday.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the Court would decide for Bolivia, and believe that this would also make little change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands is not authorized to speak to Chilean territory, and has stated that it will not be decided on the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that IGH's decision has been in place six months after the conclusion, in the view of Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, concludes that the case was “not complicated”.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also mean a return.
"The current Bolivian government has raised the question of access to the sea," Zárate said.
She pointed out that Morales' military rhetoric has stifled any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will sometimes continue their talks, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, reiterated the view that the court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia has “an extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations to Chile” and an opportunity to “end the 139 years of struggles for mutual advantage”, he said.
Calzadilla also argues that morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – use the topic of the sea as a political bridge.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to recognize that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament only takes place if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be able to disarm their nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement commitments made during a summit between the Heads of State of the rivals in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to have been in Singapore for more than three months after the summit with the North Korean state chief Kim Jong-un just ahead of bringing the established nuclear diplomacy back into progress.
Ri pointed out that other sanctions and resistance of the United States would ever force the North into the knees as a "Hergespinst" against a declaration to end the Korean war.
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the statement without Pjöngang taking major disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, it prevails widely distributed Skeps that Pjöngang seriously means giving up an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pjöngang for next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris the latest collections for huge head coverings that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to extend your Hut collection or completely clear the sun, you don't have to look any longer.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed on the run a palette of crazy oversized head coverings for their summer collection 2019, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Extremely impractical cabins have flown Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their spectacular creations over the course.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagance of beige-coloured hat with a federated wide edge that just pushed the heads of the models.
As other super-dimensional accessories, watermelons, a magic hat and even ananas were shown with jewelry. However, they are not meant to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were provided with upholstered lips and had more similarities with Hannibal Lecter than with skin Couture.
One creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkel and fogglass, while another looked like a molten iron.
And if you want to set up another huge fashion status, you're lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge head coverings could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The over-dimensional huts follow directly the "La Bomba", the stork with 60 centimeters wide edge, which all carry from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpracticed hat, which hit large waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the track: a beach bag made of straw, which was almost as big as the model wearing a bath suit that held the bag.
The bass bag in red orange with bass francs and a white leather ring at the Paris fashion week was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection "La Riviera".
Prominent-stylist Luke Armitage said regarding FEMAIL: “I expect large huts and beach bags to be available for the next summer in the shopping streets. The designer has taken such a lot of attention that the demand for over-dimensional accessories will be barely ignored.”
John Edward: Languages for World Citizens Essential
Scotland's independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence. In 2018 this continued with outstanding results and is supported only by individual and joint success in the fields of sport, art, music and other community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) aim to provide their students and their parents with the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak with someone in a language he understands, you will reach his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot leave ourselves in English only if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current results of this year's examination show that languages with the highest existing rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who learned foreign languages achieved note A in higher tests.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin achieved Note A in higher examinations, while 72 percent of students who learned German, 69 percent of students who learned French, and 63 percent of students who learned Spanish also achieved Note A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are considered to be electoral subjects as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the teaching plans of independent schools and other places.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons were the employers called for the problems of maintaining open positions in connection with a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills will increasingly be required when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more open places require languages, these knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the profession chosen, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such lifelong ability.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically be given an advantage to competitors.
According to a survey by more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent did not speak foreign language well enough to conduct entertainment, and French was spoken as the only language by a double percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is important for children today that we now invest in language learning.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages from developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the classic modern languages, while other languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom, for example Mandarin or Japanese, will be taught.
Wherever the interests of your child lie, independent schools will always have a number of languages with appropriate specialized teachers to choose.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, as always the future looks.
At this time in a global economic environment, languages cannot be denied that they are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country. Therefore, this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as 'international communication capacity'."
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this opportunity, diversity and excellence.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James arrive for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait will soon end.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton announced that on Sunday James will play in the opening game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the number of minutes he will play is not yet fixed.
"There will be more than one and less than 48" said Walton on the official website of the lakers.
Laker's reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play only a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week, James was asked after training his plans for the six games of the lakers.
"I don't need pre-season games in this phase of my career," he said.
Time for Trump's announcement in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of election campaigns.
This is the first of Trump's five clients planned for the next week, including well-known places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the sworn vote on the confirmation of his election for the Supreme Court's holiday, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections in November, as the Republican danger is running, thereby losing control of the Congress.
When does Trump's announcement take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's announcement in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (east coast time).
You can track Trump's advertising in West Virginia as livestream at YouTube online.
Trump will probably address the hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, on charges of sexual misconduct conducted this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on confirmation remains in Sweden for up to a week, while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main objective of this series is to support Republicans who have to make difficult choices in a November.
Therefore, President Trump's election team told Reuters that these five events will serve next week to “mobilise volunteers and supporters while the Republicans try to obtain and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives”.
"The control of the Congress is so important for its plans that the President will travel in as many states as possible, while the operational election season is approaching," said a trumpet speaker who did not want to name his name against Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the announcement planned at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could be shared by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and reported by the media from Pittsburgh for the evening.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month in West Virginia, the federal state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team shows readiness to maintain hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds the four parties on Saturday morning may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The floating pendulum of the moment is a pure invention as a sport concept, but one that the players really believe, and that especially in competitions like these.
So where is the moment of her opinion now?
"They were in charge with six points, and now there are four, so I think that this means a small moment for us," Jordan Spieth said while leaving the playground.
Of course, Europe is in favour and is ahead of four points, while twelve others follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and can present three of four points each.
Spieth was extremely strong from the slaughter to the green and went ahead with a good example.
The Guttural Exhibit was louder in the further course of his round than he narrowed down an important path to decide the fourth match with four points for both after he and Thomas had returned after two holes with two points.
His Putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for her, solved a similar step that leads to the fact that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"I really need to clean up and take care of my own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have achieved as the only player in the last two days more points than Spieth and Thomas, thus no doubt writing the story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal but sympathetic duo is at four of four points and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who didn't beat a Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Boley's on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and on the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the released amount undermines that they are the players to beat it on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to win a possible European victory at the fall of the Sun over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
Speaking of European fame, however, it would be too late.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the fourth hero of the morning who played with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Swedish into a glue that they could not overrun.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them.
The four and four pairs are as fascinating as the interaction between the couples, the advice they give or do not give, and the way in which a strategy can quickly change.
The Europeans have so far played better as a team and are in the lead on the last day. However, this round has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the USA, have hesitated.
Europe goes on the last day of Ryder Cup with 10:6 in leadership
Europe is ahead of the four and four parties from Saturday to the United States at 10:6 and is taking a strong lead in the last day of Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the difficult Tiger Woods and could book four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, referred to by Thomas Bjørn, who wanted to recover the trophies lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the fourths on the morning against the wrong-playing American team and won the 3-1 series.
In the four parties, the United States won more resistance and won two matches, but the resistance could not be lifted.
Jim Fury's team needed eight points in the twelve items played on Sunday to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood won four points as the first European Neulling, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend of Molliwood, won only four points as the second duo in Ryder Cup's history in their four opening match.
After they had beaten Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they perfectly harmonized and beat the destroyed Woods and the American Newling Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who had slipped through two matches on Saturday, occasionally let his brilliance shine, but now 19 of his 29 matches have been lost in fours and fours and sevens.
Justin Rose, who had retired during the four days earlier, returned and played the four parties as partners of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopka, the number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day in the south-west of Paris, not everything was according to their ideas.
The three-fold major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the measuring slot for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
In the four, they won a 2&1 victory over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3, after losing the first two holes.
In the history of Ryder Cup, it has only occurred twice that a team came back after it had gone into the individual with a remainder of four points. However, as a holder of title enough for Fury's team to keep the trophies.
After only two days in second place, it doesn't look like they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea Foreign Minister said on Saturday before the United Nations that continued sanctions would deepen her mistrust towards the United States and that under these circumstances the country would never give up its nuclear weapons on its own.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea had taken "essential measures of good will" last year. For example, it has stopped nuclear and rocket tests to decompose the nuclear test site and has committed itself not to increase nuclear weapons and technologies.
"But we don't see a corresponding response from the USA," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will never be alone first."
While Ri reiterated his confidence in North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-wise" approach in the process of denouncing, in North Korea for successful steps, his statement seemed significant when she did not reject unilateral denounization from the past, as Pjöngang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an official U.S. president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore. Kim had assured him that he would work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean war from 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said that Pjöngang must first cease its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes claims after a lockdown of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States is on "first denuclearization" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and they are even opposed to "the declaration of the end of war," Ri said.
“The assumption that we can impose sanctions on our knees is a breast-feeding of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not go into plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. state chief had highlighted at the beginning of the week with the United Nations.
Instead, at three meetings between Kim and South Korean state chief Moon Jae-in over the past five months, the Minister added: “If South Korea were the other party to the nuclearization issue instead of the United States, it would not have come to this stop in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”
However, the tone of Ris spoke differed enormously from his speech last year, when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea rockets on the mainland of the United States after "the evil president" Trump Kim referred to himself as "Raketenmann" as a suicide mission.
This year Trump, who had threatened North Korea's "full destruction" last year, took over Kim to the United Nations with praise for his courage in terms of disarmament. However, he said that there was still much work to be done and that the sanctions should remain in force until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for it: "whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pjöngang for the steps taken.
On Thursday, however, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said regarding the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued energetically in any case until we have achieved the complete, final and verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unilaterally strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to finance the withdrawal of Pjöngang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the side of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjöngang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July he said at the departure from Pjöngang that progress has been made, only for hours later to be charged by North Korea, he has made “walking demands”.
North Korea promised this month to reduce a meeting with Moon, a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States took appropriate measures.
He said that Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" sought were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep during this year's basic study. This is a measure against the growing macho culture, to stay awake with caffeine and to learn over the whole night.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is his opinion according to the first such course in the USA.
He was inspired to call the course into life after having held a lecture on the effects of sleeplessness on learning.
“At last, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I have to learn from it just now, in my last year?’
After their words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. I was surprised," he said about The Telegraph.
This year's first course explained to the students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance and also improve the general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said that the University had decided to introduce the course after she found that students were under heavy sleepiness during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, the students see the picture of a room in a living room and click on coffee tables, curtains, training shoes and books. They receive information on the effect of caffeine and light as well as on the effects of sleep deprivation on the sports performance and the importance of a sleepoutine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleepiness can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer.
They are then encouraged to reflect on their daily routine by means of a map of the university field with interactive symbols.
“We know that students’ behaviour will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of moving a 'night shift' was still widespread, he said and added that modern technologies and the ever-growing pressure on students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
To ensure adequate sleep, he said that all students' "treasures" should be against stress, exhaustion and fear. Furthermore, a weight gain was avoided, as sleeptuck put the brain in the hungry mode, so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. He had a course in Harvard last year in his first year.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to press on to a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be invited to complete a similar study programme before taking up their studies at the competitive university.
Following the recommendation of Professor Czeisler, students should set themselves up a weekend for sleep and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that comes from electronic screens and LED lighting and can bring forth the zircadian rhythm out of the touch.
Livingston against Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor against Gerards Players
The Rangers lost another outside game when the hit by Dolly Menga for Steven Gerard's unifying team meant a 0:1 downfall at Livingstone.
The Ibrox team wanted to book its first outside victory since the 4:1 Triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holts team added Gerard the first defeat in 18 games as manager, so that his team left eight points behind the leading Hearts in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before half-time, and the inspirational rangers seemed to have no chance of compensation.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingstone rises to the third place and is only behind hibernian at the Tordifference.
The Rangers also threatens further anxiety after having to be treated by a guest block object due to a head wall.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that took over Ayr and reached the half-final of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, among the same eleven Livingstone players, who took one point to their hearts last week, he must have been thrilled to see how his well-trained team kept their opponents on their steps and steps under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingstone reached more when they had the ball.
They were supposed to get a door after only two minutes when Mengas first delivered Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gate. However, the middle-field player missed his chance and took a shot.
Then a long walk from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halket, but his rebel partner Alan Lithgov was only able to pass through the back alley.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously the view that after a quarter of an hour, he would have had to get a penalty for a clash between him and Steven Lawless, but the judge Steven Thomson did not apply the Colombian complaints.
The Rangers arrived in the first half of the day only two torso, but the former Ibrox-toorhüter Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibalys headball and a shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston hits in the 34th minute probably did not match the game course, it is not to be lied that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were unable to handle a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who held the peace and sought Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerard acted for half-time and replaced Coulibally against Ryan Kent. The change almost immediately showed effect when the player brought Morelos into position, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the ball.
However, the guests continued to play exactly the game they were sitting on, with Lithgov and Halkett getting a long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded its leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stood well and refused Jacobs before Lithgov passed a headball out of the corner.
The Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton also asked for a penalty later on after a match with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning German: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger counter.
Since then, the geiger numerator has become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the whole world is this?"
Rogers: “It is a geiger numerator used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Indeed, I hear a knock!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can cause the immune system to "see"
A new cancer vaccine can cause the immune system to “see” and destroy discarded cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to detect delayed cells in the course of treatment.
The method allows a patient to remove immune cells that are modified in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a lot of cancer-like common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
The egg cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that causes the immune system to detect delayed cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method allows a patient to take immune cells that are modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” the many types of cancer common protein HER2. Afterwards, the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promots the growth of different types of cancers", including breast, eggstock, lung and intestine cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which immunosuppressive cells are removed and added to cancer cells has helped in the treatment of a leukaemia type.
Kanye West released a pro-Trump triad after his appearance at SNL and carried a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It wasn't good.
Kanye West was promoted to Saturday Night Live in the studio after he widely praised US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to become a presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and wearing a Make-America Great-Again hat, he continued with a ski cannon against the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trump.
“I will be asked so often by white people, “How can you like Trump? He is racist.”
So if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the mission with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made a fun of the charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford, about Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Justice Committee.
Although the record of the West Shipyard was not sent, it was uploaded by the comicist Chris Rock in social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the publication about the West.
West also complained to the audience that he had difficulties behind the stage because of his head covering.
“They fooled me behind the stage.
They said, “Don’t go out with the hat.”
You fucked me up!
And then they say I was in a pitiful area," he said to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the dark area?" He said he would "draw my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. Do you want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
His remarks triggered at least twice the noise from the audience, and SNL-interferents had a painful effect, reported Variety. One person said in the magazine: "It became fatal in the studio."
West was later obliged to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a talk entitled "I Love It", where he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: DANKE, THAT YOU ARE MASSE DEFENDED HOST."
However, the talk show moderator Karen Hunter tweeted, West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I would like someone who, in my opinion, makes himself too harmful to my community and gives himself no reward (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his “art”).
He's free.
The same applies to us." she added.
Before the broadcast, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and now "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The officially known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg brought the name Snoop Lion, and of course changed Prince, the deceased musician, his name in a symbol and then in "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".

"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington Attacked Toxic Humanity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword swinging Jon Snow in HBOs of violent medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said that such roles on the screen would have to be strong as a result of the fact that boys often had the feeling of being strong to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believed that something had gone wrong, and asked how the problem of toxic humanity in the #MeToo season was solved.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, who is also involved in the Game of Thrones, and 31 of them, added that he felt that the solution to the problem was “very important”.
"I personally find the question very important at the moment, what has been wrong with humanity," he said.
"What have we brought to the attention of men who are growing up with regard to the problem that we are now watching?"
Harington believes that because of the very masculine characteristics, television may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is born again, and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the street that the boys feel they have to incorporate this particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change this?
For there has been a manifest error in the case of young men."
He also stated in the interview that after the end of the series, he will not participate in prequels or sequences of “Game of Thrones”. He has “enough of battlefields and horses”.
Since November, Harington is in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West" to see the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently boasts that for him the best was "Game of Thrones" that he had known his wife Rose.
"I have known my wife during this mission, so this is how I received my future family and my life from now," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantastic Ygritte, with numerous Emmys, the favorites of Harington's character Jon Snow.
Both married in June 2018 to Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported increase of 14% in new cases
China reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, the transfer took place in the vast majority of the new cases by sex.
So far, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected in this way with HIV was almost zero, Chinese health officials reported at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was eradicated in 1997 in China, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community should be widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are finally married to women.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to insufficient protection in the transport of sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees have been able to secure the data of the GOP senators, criticizing "hazardous lies" and "swearing theories"
Maxine Waters, member of the U.S. House of Representatives, is fighting allegations on Saturday, a member of her staff has published the personal information of three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the MPs.
The Los Angeles Democrat believes that the claims of "ultra-rights" would be spread by experts and websites.
"Flying, lying, and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information is intended to include the private addresses and telephone numbers of the US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. During the hearing of a Senate committee on the charges raised against Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh for sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the contributions, was associated with Waters' office, and published the information of a member of Waters' staff, reported The Hill.
"This unsubstantiated charge is absolutely wrong and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations, was in no way responsible for ensuring this information.
This unsubstantiated charge is absolutely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement triggered fast criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This Dementi is angry," Fleischer wrote.
“This leads to the conclusion that she does not have the right temper to be a member of the Congress.
People who are accused of something they have not done should not be angry.
You mustn't be proud.
You must not question the motives of the defendant.
You must be calm and let go."
Fleischer Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats at Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics, seemed to have worked too hard on Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, also a Republican candidate who attends half-time elections to solve water, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that's true," he tweeted.
Waters stated in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and the prosecution authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the workers are revealed," she continued, "and that they will be taken into account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my staff".
Critics about "Johnny English – You only live three times" – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for new Brexit references in any British-coloured film. It also seems to be applicable to this re-recovery of the action comedy parody “Johnny English” which began in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spion, which started it” and in 2011 with “Johnny English – Now only right” relived.
Will an ironic self-paraody on the topic, as we are obviously aware, for the new exportance for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glaucoma, grimases cutting and incompetent Johnny English was extended for the second time. His name signals more than anything else that he is a general comical creation for cinema visitors in the non-English space.
Of course, he is once again the busy secret agent, who looks strangely cool and world-class, while in reality he has contributed something from Clouseau, a prize Mr. Bean and a clatter of this bursary, which, at the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London, has contributed a single note to the title song of "The Hour of the Winner".
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos behind retired travelers and international secretaries who played the Atkinson in the recently forgotten Barclaycard TV stores.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked the way Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor leaves were close to his helmet.
Atkinson's performance for physical comics is increasing, but humor seems to be quite weak and rare, especially because the "serious" films such as "007" and "Mission Ni" are currently offering self-evident comedian elements.
The humor seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy misdemeanours are not as impressive and focused as Atkinson's stupid movie gags in the role of the bean.
The eternal present prize is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, much to the detriment of the serving agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, a blond and tense figure already standing before the complete collapse because of her political infidelity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script does not give much to her work with.
Their secret service advisors inform them that all active spies have been removed and therefore they have to get someone out of rest.
This is also part of the excellent Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a sent institution, but there is unofficial teaching in the work as a undercover agent. There are a few gags in it, because English offers a espionage academy that reminds the "School of Rock".
English will be brought back to Whitehall for an emergency appointment and reunited with his former heavy-tested Kumpan Bough, which is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-boot commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin, who always make everything terriblely wrong in the secret service of your Majesty, are back in action. They meet Olga Kurylenkos beautiful Femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister is dangerously involved in the bonds of a charismatic tech billionaire, the window Jason Lacy played by Jake Volta, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain.
English and Bough start their odyssey of the grotesque spas: As Kellner dressed, they put a cool French restaurant in fire, they make sure of chaos when they dive on board Voltas luxury yacht, and English opens clean anarchy when he tries to make himself familiar with the interior of Voltas house with a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, although all registers are drawn, but so sympathetic and funny she is also, the subject is already dealt with in detail in children's television.
Pretty moderate stuff.
As with the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself, "Can't the British film industry Rowan Atkinson really play a role that is really right for his talent?"
Labour disputes to work on a plan after which the British work four days a week but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The party intends to report that the company managers will pass on the savings achieved by the KI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional day free of charge to the workers.
In order for employees to have a three-day weekend, however, they would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country for the benefit of the workers is 'appropriate'.
Turnover to a four-day week was supported by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A high - ranking source from the Labour Party said regarding the Sunday Times: “A directive review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"A change will not occur overnight, but a work week of four days is an effort that is consistent with the party's approach to restoring economic balance for workers and with the party's general industrial policy strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the general election campaign 2017.
However, the approach is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A speaker from the Labour Party said: "In a four-day week it is not a party policy and it is not taken into consideration by the party."
The shadow Chancellor John McDonnell made his presentation at the Labour Conference last week of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "profitmakers" in public supply companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not retain their full share, as a labor government could take "abductions" due to alleged misbehaviour.
He also confirmed the relevant plans to recruit employees in the company's offices and set up inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who cancel annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy said in the news magazine "60 minutes", whether the FBI's investigation in the case of Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation into the proposals against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has a final vote on his appointment as Judge at the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Authority could influence Republican senators in order to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to the fore, which could eventually change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I announced in the debate that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him back, this claim was made, and asked if he had done it.
He was determined, determined, and unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be fixed in stone.
"My opinion is clear about Brett Kavanaugh, and it had to be a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know this: Brett has fought this very hard," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called could not confirm it."
It's 36 years.
And I can't make any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has been helped to reduce poverty in the framework of this festival?
On this Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival will take place to fight a annual music festival with an impressive lineup to stars and an equally impressive mission – the poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place this year for the 7th time, not only to experience the events of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness of the actual objective of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group is trying to combat poverty by motivating more and more people to actively participate in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks. These include actions such as voluntary work, communication with a leading global politician (by e-mail or telephone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – the fight against poverty –.
How successful is the project if you consider that Global Citizens remain 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is it the idea to look at a cool free concert, a meaningful opportunity to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called cliquetism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizens have reported that the project has been able to list more than 19 million actions from its supporters since 2011.
These actions should contribute to attracting leading politicians from around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least 10 billion US dollars were already paid or entered by fundraising.
According to the group's estimates, the funds secured so far have a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the The Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of investors and implementers with headquarters in the United Kingdom, who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million in combating malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition to a footnote in history," the ambassadors of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions called on Britain to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the The Power of Nutrition project to reach 5 million women and children and provide food interventions.
As a response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
They replied: “There will be a long and challenging path with heights and depths.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will have success, as we are together stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who took part in this year's New York event, including Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The US could use the Navy for blockage purposes to prevent Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington can return to the Navy if necessary, so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets, including the Middle East, the US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke shared.
Zinke claimed that the use of Russia in Syria is a pretext to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently active at the invitation of the legal government in these areas.
"I think that the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is to negotiate new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are means and ways to do this.
"The United States can ensure, together with the Navy, that the sea streets remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that is known as "the voice of electricity consumers" in the United States.
He drew a comparison between Washington's practices in dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they were practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while he described Russia as "One Trick Pony" with a fossil-dependent economy.
The declarations were made when the government was under Trump to extend exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thereby replace Russia with the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unmeasured" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, became Moscow's "capture".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion US dollars, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters to be an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US received a counterwind from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third country joins in our energy supply," says the board of the BDI Dieter struggle after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "examine" a presidential candidacy 2020," says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "examine" a presidential candidacy after the interim elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to examine a presidential candidacy after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is heading in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about the way Donald Trump is dealing with our democracy," she said.
In her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, Warren did not take a sheet in front of his mouth.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that a FBI inquiry was, of course, necessary before the vote.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of the Warren Elections do not believe that they should apply for 2020.
According to the survey of the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not run.
32% of voters supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent who advocated a potential candidacy, and 48 percent who are against it.
The other names of prominent democracies that come to the fore in terms of a possible candidate's 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden shared that he would officially decide until January.
Sarah Palin speaks on the Donald Trump-Rally for post-traumatic load disturbance, suffering under the track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son can do, what he can do, when he comes back, can sense everything other families that feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds that our soldiers will return with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as an elephant in the room and said about her son and other war veterans that she had changed, that she had returned to the country, that they had returned and wondered if there was this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused a woman of domestic violence, as said Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Police Department of Wasilla.
18 states and D.C. support a legal aid to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal aid to the new US policy that refuses victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 federal states and the district made a statement by a judge on Friday in Washington in order to support an asylum-seeker who questioned politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace-against-session complaint, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the Federal Policy, has not been declared.
She reported that her partner "and his violent bandits" abused them, but the US officials refused their asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace, known as El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States as nations that have major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy raised a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals of 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants to apply for asylum before domestic violence.
The District of Columbia, Karl Racine, in a statement on Friday, stated that the new policy "in the decades of law ignored at state, state and international level".
‘The Federal Act requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application and that this court is in breach of this principle’, was stated in the Court’s statement.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policies that immigrants refuse access to the country have an adverse effect on the US economy, as immigrants could be more active than entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
In June, the Federal Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered that immigrants who flee from domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs should no longer provide asylum.
"Asyl is there for all those who leave their home country because they are persecuted or afraid because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction," the session said in its announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan to remove all problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems people have to struggle with every day around the world.
Suspected rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of deaths in the race doubles with time
The situation has become increasingly worse for survivors.
"It's all very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma and calms her little fibrous son in a rescue center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute a new hospital car comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is short."
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed houses to collect their most fertile Hab and good and to mount everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the employees of the hospitals, who were damaged by the earthquake with the force of 7.5, were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who raised vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of the constant strong descendants.
With tears in his eyes, he related how the severe earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and his daughter.
“All went too fast.
I think I was trapped under the fallen walls," he reported to the Associated Press, adding that the reason for the city's stay was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s relief, but then there was peace.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
US ambassadors complain to China of tyranny with "Propaganda Shows"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper had turned on a four-sided display in an American daily newspaper, in which the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China were announced, US ambassadors in China accused the state capital Beijing of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
Last Wednesday, the United States Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid supplement in The Moines Register, the most-selved magazine in Iowa, after he accused China of joining the US Congress elections on 6 November, a charge that China disputes.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the US waves are consistent with the U.S. officials' announcement to Reuters; a new phase of a escalating campaign, triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to switch advertising to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently being turned into an excessive trade war, with duties on imports for both countries.
Chinese payrolls at the start of the trade war should meet exporters in countries such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who exports large-scale agricultural products to China, shared that Beijing workers, owners of agricultural holdings and companies had been damaged.
China, then Branstad in an opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday, now doubles this tyranny by switching propaganda into its own free press in the United States.
"With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government advocates the tradition of freedom of opinion and independent press, which has been proven in America, by switching the country's advertising into the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, you will find only a limited number of votes on the press in Beijing and not a real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have on China's disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article. However, he did not call the name of the newspaper.
Republicans sell voters in front of the interim elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warns observers
As many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of several allegations of sexual violence, observers warned against a counter-reaction during the upcoming elections, which could in particular leave women.
The vote in this connection was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already indicated that they continue to vote.
"Such things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last minute's advance of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) was sufficient for an FBI investigation to recruit angry voters.
"Do not forget what was yesterday, they do not forget it tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first adviser and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn, so the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called on the Senate's floating area "November is coming!" when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to hold the Kavanaughs nomination and reported that despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important theme, shared by Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political observer of the news site.
“People say it's already high, that's true.
But it could be higher, especially for voters in the suburbs and younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not choose."
Even before the Ford’s public statement, in which its charges of sexual assault against the candidates of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans gave the confirmation.
"This situation is a true one for the GOP," said the beginning of last week's Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, NBC News.
“It is not only the body’s vote, the final vote or the Kavanaugh review; it is also the way in which the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it,” said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group supporting the election of Democrats, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be unconcerned about whom they should believe because of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly greater share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced by the statement of Ford, while 35% indicated that they were definitely or probably giving Kavanaugh faith.
In addition, 38% indicated that they were of the opinion that Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied to his statement, while 30% indicated the same about Ford.
After the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported, The Guardian.
Ford made a statement last week before the Senate Justice Committee that she was attacked by drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had betrayed her genitals when she was at a party during her study period in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, currently launches a startup to the market with the aim of establishing a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, inrupt, is a company based on the Open Source Platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data will be stored and who will receive access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the intention behind the collapse was the "welcomeness".
"We need to be active now," he said on the topic of startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app sets up the technology of Solid so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library as well as other tools for the private and corporate field.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in a browser and at the same time.
The particular thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can decide alone who can access the data.
The company refers to this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to the CEO of John Bruce, the idea behind the collapse is that the company uses resources, processes and corresponding capabilities to make solid for all.
Currently, companies include Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been set up to work on this project, as well as a community volunteer programmer. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM is used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers can create their own decentralized apps worldwide with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee shared that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google if a comprehensive change is to be made when their entire business model is completely redesigned overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a contribution to a medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy production and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee provided a redesign of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee was involved in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Victorian Cross in the 1st World War, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was distinguished as a fighter with the Victorian crusade during the 1st World War, was honored in his home city 100 years later.
Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his use in the attack on Bellenglie and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sharp shield and never found out that he had won the highest British war award.
On Sunday, his two grandsons revealed a monument to a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the uncles, Michael Vann, thought that this act was full of symbolism, since the monument was revealed exactly 100 years after the hero's date for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918; through dense fog and under heavy fire of field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he pushed the fire line and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before moving forward with a single-armed field weapon and three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot by a German sharp shield on October 4, 1918; something more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the deeds of his grandfather were something he could never be justified, and at the same time something that would make a humble one.
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he placed a skull under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band after the parade.
Michael Vann said that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the bravety of a real hero would be visible primarily by supporting many people.
MMA fans have stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The calculation of San Jose included 13 battles, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock, just as Ggard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, the audiences in the United Kingdom were not bad when Peppa Pig was suddenly seen.
Some remain unaffected after staying awake until the early hours of the morning to see the battle in particular.
A fan described on Twitter the change to the trick film figure as a kind of bad joke.
"Because of a government regulation, these contents are classified as non-youth free, so they had to be changed to a child shipment at 6 o'clock," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in the area of marketing and communication with Bellator when he was asked about the transfer.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The company board at Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will be working on the expiry plan to take into account visitors from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think the problem could have been solved by the game," he said.
“But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday with the visitors in the United Kingdom, and we will not solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay here.
There was a lot of communication during the change, and it was very nice and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and we have come to the conclusion that it is a technical disturbance.
What wasn't the case was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 fights, as in the normal case, and we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experience.
The whole situation is pretty sad."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "delay" on the topic of sexuality
Tom Daley, who took part in various Olympic games, says that he grew up with the feeling of being subject to everyone else because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to be so successful.
The 24-year-old felt that he had only realized at the secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken on the subject of Schulen rights to encourage others.
He also meant, since he became a father, the victory in the Olympic games is no longer so important to him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses disease condition for a few months.
In the first shipment of Laverne, he said that he once viewed himself as inferior in comparison to others, since the love of boys and girls was totally unacceptable.
He said: "To this day is the feeling of being inferior and different from the others, the reason for my power and strength and finally for my success."
He wanted to prove that he was a very special person in order not to disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation was known.
The double bronze medal winner in the Olympics is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his performance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he had expressed himself on this subject because he could happily live without restrictions and without discrimination and would like to make other courage.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The recognition of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old winner in the previous year, but he told me that the age difference had never been a topic.
He thinks that if you had to spend so much as a child and young people – he took 14 for the first time in the Olympics and his father died three years later in cancer, it is hard to find someone at the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple have had a son who bears the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley thinks that his whole view has changed since then.
Even last year, he had turned everything around with gold medals.
But for him there are now more important than Olympia gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the imminent death, and one of the last things he asked was the tickets for London in 2012, as he wanted to be with it in the first place.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that it was finally clear to me that he was not inaccessible," he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
"I only knew that it was always my dream to dive in Olympic games in front of the home audience – that was the nonsense," he said.
His first selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced. He heard the song in front of the Olympics and was still caring for genshehaut.

Mikkelson, who is currently not in shape, is sitting at Ryder Cup on Saturday at the replacement bank
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to make a lot of effort so that the whole thing doesn't become a debacle.
Mickelson, who played at the 12th time event, was sent by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday to the replacement bank.
Instead of being at the centre of the event, the five-year-old Major spent his day in order to fire others and work at his game, in the hope of solving the problems he was charged with.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mikkelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal crew for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misdirected balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself was not encouraging enough, Mikkelson met on Sunday in the ninth game on the perfectist British Open-Champion Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, Neuling at this tournament, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points retreat at the 12 individual games a hot start, Mikkelson's game could prove to be absolutely decisive.
Fury expressed his confidence in Mikkelson and could not add much.
"He was fully aware of his current role in clarifying, gave me a stick on my back and put his arm around me and thought he was ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is one of the world's best-known personalities and has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn't think he was in two games.
I had more to imagine, but that's how it's been, and that's what we've been expecting.
He wants to be like everyone else."
Mikkelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup race path that never entirely matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson could record 18 wins, had to score 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Fury announced that his presence alone had enriched the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original and he likes to make a few delays, and he's a great man who's popular with the whole team," he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little closer this week. It was fun to watch them.
He's a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can be over soon with the lead
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage that leads to the last individual games in Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seven Ballesteros had a lead of five points against the Americans, but only came just over the target line and went in the lead with the least possible lead and gained a victory of 141 1⁄2-13 1⁄2.
"The thought remains that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only recently," said Bjørn (pictured on the photo), after he saw the victory 5-3 of the class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it's not over.
It's gonna be okay tomorrow.
Put yourself in the good news and do exactly the right thing.
The whole is only over when the points are on the display table.
We have a goal, we want to win this trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I've always said that I've focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're completely clear about what we're facing on the other side: the best players in the world."
Fear of the performance that his players had completed on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never miss it.
Tomorrow's gonna be another caliber.
In the morning, the individual services are in the foreground and this is a completely different matter.
It's great to work with a partner when things go well, but if you're out there alone, then you'll be tested to the limits of your abilities as a golfer.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you let your partner behind you and he also needs to get the best out of himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Fury, will note that his players individually cut better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Fury himself stood on both sides of that big turn on the last day of the tournament. He stood in Brookline on the winning side before he stood on the sides of the losers after Europe's "Wonder of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the fast start you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the moment hits in a direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to spell tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of combating the challenge, he had to enter the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the upper half of the rankings.
"I have decided for the boys in this order, because I believe it covers everything," Bjorn said about his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship is lagging behind.
The newest freighters of the German Navy were to be put in service in 2014 to replace warships coming in the years from the Cold War. However, it will be delivered by local media due to faulty systems and fast-growing costs only earlier next year.
The launch of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been moved to the first half of 2019, according to the time it took on a military speaker.
The ship was supposed to be put into service in 2014, but the ambitious project of worrying problems after delivery was planned.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old frescoes of the Bremen class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a series of flight defence rockets and sea target bodies, as well as tar technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflexion.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest fregats do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delays can lead to the ageing of the high-modern warships, which are intended to represent Germany as a seafarer, at the time of their entry into force, as Die Time.
The F125 F125 Fregate, which was followed by accident, has been on the battlefield for the last year when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the Werft Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship after its delivery to the shipyard.
It was little known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a series of significant "software and hardware errors", which made the new ship useless in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious as vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of only 120 mattresses, only about half as many as on the older frescoes of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too difficult, leading to performance gains and preventing the marine being able to carry out construction measures in the future.
The 7000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany in the second world war.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the costs of the whole project, including the training costs of the occupation, were also a problem.
It appears that the costs increased to adegradable €3.1 billion compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregats are particularly significant in view of the latest warnings that Germany's maritime fleet is crashing.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag's military commander, confirmed that the Navy "is going out of the capable ships".
Bartels said that the problem with time was increased, since old ships were taken apart from service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the freshties of the Baden-Württemberg class could be removed from the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Federmäuse
In an estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research works are being carried out to show how Fledermäuse uses the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the results will allow further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help to encourage future nature conservation activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will be researched by Zerg- and Mückenfendermäuseen as well as the Braunen Langohr and Waterfedermäuseen in Inverewe Garden in Western Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the ground to record the activities of the bat during the whole season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
In an analysis of the noise of all the recordings by experts, the frequency of the flue-mouse calls is determined and determined which species does what.
Then a map and a report of the living room will be created to create a detailed picture of its behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Adviser, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are the most important and how they are used by each species.
These data will contribute to determining the benefits of measures to manage the living space, such as the creation of meadows, and to showing how to obtain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The stockpiles in Scotland and the entire United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect sleeping places and lead to the loss of living space.
Windscreens and lighting can also present a risk, as can fly-flights and chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Fledermäuse is not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful because of their nightly hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching bees.
They use a failed escort to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the whole of Scotland takes the issue of bats very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who carry out regular surveys, sleep-place inspections and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even set up the first and only Fledermouse Reserve in the Thrave property in Dumfries and Galloway, the home for eight of Scotland's 10 Fledermouse species.
Goodman David Thompson explains that the possession of the ideal living space was for her.
"Here in Thrave we have a great area for fledermäuse," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living room.
But there are many things that we do not yet know about Federmuse, so here and to other people, we do these works that will help us to learn more about what Federmuse needs to feel."
He stresses the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance in the goods, as it is possible that the accidental destruction of a single nesting site would kill up to 400 females and young animals and destroy the entire population on site.
Fledermäuse is protected and it is illegal to kill them, to harm them, or to destroy their nests, respectively.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish member of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We still have to learn much about bats and we do not know how their populations are."
Ronaldo argues about rape while his lawyers want to declare the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to the allegations of rape raised against him as "Fake News" and said that people want to "be famous" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to declare the news magazine The mirror that published the charges.
The stormer of the National Team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Supposedly he paid her $375.000 to buy her piggyback for the event, says The Mirror on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video to its 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports only hours after their release as "Fake News."
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," the player added smiling.
According to Reuters, lawyers are prepared to present the mirror on the basis of the charges they claim to be 'inadmissible report on suspicions in the field of privacy'.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a compensation for “moral damage in an amount equal to the severity of the legal breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged event was to take place in 2009 at a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
When they met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped them, according to documents submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to the knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "99 percent a good guy", which was the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say it had been agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later admitted to an extrajudicial agreement, since she had “feels before revenge” and made sure to be “publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old said that she was now trying to withdraw the agreement, as she was still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was shortly before he moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid and changed this summer into a 100 million euros heavy deal for the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “defeate forever” the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "permanently regret it" if, after Brexit, it lost its status as a world-leading car manufacturer, so said Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He further said that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that the production in the work in Burnaston at Derby would be interrupted temporarily, Britain should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," says Clark.
The Japanese automaker stated that the influence of delays on the border could lead to job losses in a no-deal bug.
The work in Burnaston, in which Toyotas Auris and Avensis are produced, produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will experience production stops at an uncontrolled Brexit End of March in our work”, says Marvin Cooke, Toyotas Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also allowed concerns about a hard EU withdrawal without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its mini-work in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns lie with car manufacturers with risks within the supply chain in a hard Brexit.
Toyotas manufacturing plant is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be interruptions which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and disadvantages in the parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to lead a stockhold in Derbyshire, which lasted longer than a day, the company explained why the production had to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa Mays Chequers' plan on future relations with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows us, as I have already said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he explained in the BBC Radio 4 broadcast today.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not state how long the production had to be interrupted, but long-term warnings that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the work and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the United Nations trade union, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience never comes back when they’re just gone.
One government speaker said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's planned meetings with Rosenstein could be moved again according to White House data
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "moved for another week", while the dispute about the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, was called from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has been monitoring the work of the Special Ombudsman Robert Mueller, who is investigating the whale mixes by Russia, the connections between Trump's consultants and Russia, as well as possible injustices by the President.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Minister of Justice and thereby endanger the independence of Mueller has been the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had the opportunity to record his secret talks with Trump as well as the President's meeting with the addition of the 25th Constitution.
Rosenstein decomposed the report.
However, he moved to the White House last Monday, while new reports of his likely retreat were announced.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then held at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for the next Thursday,
Trump explained that he would not let go of Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to prevent it from collying with the hearing before the U.S. Senate's Justice Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, said.
On Friday, Trump arranged a one-week FBI investigation of the proposals against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press spokesman Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
On a question about meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set for this. It could be this week, but I can still imagine that it will be moved for another week, given all the things that go directly with the Supreme Court.
This will show up, but I always like the press on the run."
Some reporters would object to this claim: Sanders has not held the White House press conference since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of the press conferences did not lie in a refusal to the "Effect hat" of the TV reporters, but he said, "But I wouldn't argue that they were operating an effective hat."
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
The President makes more questions and answers rounds than any president before him," she said, without giving clear evidence: "We have seen these figures."
There will still be press conferences, so Sanders, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States direct questions, it is far better than to talk to me.
We often try to do this and you've seen that we've done this often in the last few weeks. This will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is so when he turned out to be a bit strange in front of assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes because of Brexit's concerns about EU workers of Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health is addressing persons from the EU abroad who work in Scotland for the National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and to express the wish that they remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared itself willing to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
In your letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the withdrawal negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the British government has also reinforced the preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm aware of what disturbing times this must be for you all.
That is why I once again wanted to express how much I value each person and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues and colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is full and full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christon Abercrombie was subjected to a head injury to a noto operation
The linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrombie was reported by Mike Organ of Tennessee State after a head injury that he suffered on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat against the vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, chief coach at Tennessee State, reported that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time break.
"He came to the side line and was simply broken up there," says Reed.
Trainer and medical personnel provided Abercrombie on the oxygen sideline before being placed on a carry and transported for further investigations.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the OP in the Vanderbild Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details of the nature or extent of the injury” and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 Tackles, thus increasing his total number in the season to 18 Tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax in the future for the purchase of properties in the United Kingdom. The additional revenue will benefit from the new plans of the Conservative Party without delay.
This step is intended to end the success of Jeremy Corby's campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will be all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance estimates more revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy properties in the United Kingdom, where the multiple incomes are to benefit homelessly.
This step is an attempt to dampen the success of Jeremy Corby's young voters, who promises to provide more affordable living space and take top valuers into the vision.
The increase in stamp tax will be raised on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional revenue will be provided for the government campaign against unemployment.
The increase, in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago on second apartments and the rental of residential property, could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is counting through the step with multiple incomes of up to 120 million pounds per year.
Estimated 13 percent of new properties in London are purchased by investors who are not resident in the United Kingdom. Thus prices are driven up and it will be harder for first-time buyers to take foot in the real estate business.
Many well-being areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "priorities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson said he would reduce the stamp tax to allow more young people to own the first home.
He accused construction companies of holding the real estate prices by buying land without using it, and then forced Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end Britain's "dwelling" damage."
The opposition leader Corbyn announced a spectacular series of proposals for residential reforms that range from a rental price bond to the prohibition of rooms for no valid reason.
He also wants to include more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May stated: “Last year, I said that I would devote my time as prime minister of the restoration of the British dream, which would improve the life of generations.
And that means repairing our broken apartment market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be true that it is as easy to buy property for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as for companies with a seat abroad, as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become too much for many people and the worthlessness of the homeless remains a very big problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My greatest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that it was his “greatest goal” to become the manager of the Scottish team sometime.
The 42-year-old shooter is facing the challenge of raising a new life for the North East England Association, which is in the third place in the League One, and lacks three points to the top.
He took this summer to the stadium of Light after taking St. Mirren back in the last season to the first Scottish league.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that was’s,” said Ross of the BBC Scotland Sports Sound broadcast.
“But I’ve seen my father often play in Hampden as a child, and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this option would only come if I were successful in the management of the association."
Ross predecessors in the role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic insisted not to be afraid to enter the steps of such established names at such a club after he previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment if I can bring the Association back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities of this association, he no doubt belongs to the Premier League," he explained.
“It is not a simple task to get him there, but I would probably appreciate my time here as a success only if I bring the association back there.”
Ross can present a first three-year management career, after a phase as deputy chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month activity as coaches in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever before in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That was probably a real faulty way," he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds funny because I didn't get sick, I could live well of it, and I experienced some very pleasant stages.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I still do this with regard to stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it. I've never felt so good in my skin in my whole life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass beer is Saturday at 17:30 a.m., so a study
The heat wave in the summer missed the revenues of British crissling pubs, while restaurant chains ran under greater pressure.
In July, pub and bar companies recorded a sales growth of 2.7 percent. However, the revenues at the restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's Board of Directors, who compiled the figures, explained: "Remaining sunlights and England longer than expected constant participation in the football World Championship meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, in which the pub's sales increased by 2.8 percent. However, it was even harder to find a restaurant.
The fall of 1.8 percent, which was recorded by the restaurant industry in June, continued in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed the best performance at a distance, with a surface-adjusted sales development that increased higher than it dropped at the restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food are also left in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
Looks like the people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, the drinking rates increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the food paragraph decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, of the analysts for the RSM leisure and hospitality industry, explained: “These results continue the trend that we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for the sales in the Out-of-Home market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to be struggling with problems, but sales revenues of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at any worse time for business operators with a focus on food, and it remains to be expected that the more adequate temperatures will be supplied in August."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The Sector Exchange Monitor Cache Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant area in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized branch benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts in social media that it hides from his parents
A study shows that every fifth child, sometimes once 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret in front of parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in higher education has found an increase in the so-called "Fake Insta" pages
The message suggests that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students indicated to have a "main account" to show it to their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, creates social media accounts that can keep it hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in higher education showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, an exposure to the Photo-Sharing website Instagram.
The message fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of the students indicated that they would have a clean “main account” that they could show their parents, but also have private accounts.
A mother, who stood on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who urged the other to "enforce me."
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half access to private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of the HMC, stated: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being driven to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Elidh Doyle will be "vote of the athletes" in the Scottish Sports Council
Elidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member at his annual General Assembly in the Council of the Scottish Literacy Association of Scottish Athletics.
Doyle is the most outstanding light athlete in Scotland and President Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilid will be respected in the light athletic society of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that light athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their election in the Council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am happy to act as a voice of athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won a distance of over 200 and 400 meters in 1996 at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, called his own four Olympic gold medals, and today often appeared as BBC experts, could no longer run after a temporary bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell me if or how far I'm going to heal.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to run again and make mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertising for milk pumps that compares mothers to cows, ensures excitement in the network
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided for excitement in the network with a commercial clip, in which the still mother is compared to the milk of cows.
In order to start the market, according to its own statement, 'the first cloudy milk pump worldwide', Elvie publishes a non-serious music video to highlight the freedom that the pump gives to the silent mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a bowl filled with cows in the background to a song containing the lines of text like: "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see me" or "if you haven't noticed it, it's not yours, it's my breasts."
In the refrain, it goes on to say: “Push it out, pump it out, feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladyes.”
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has triggered a controversy on the web.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video came up with mixed reactions among the audiences, many of whom say it is harmless to the "fears" of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
Just as we do, they have to be tender and bring a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys will be taken away within a few days after birth," it was said in a comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits in a quiet BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Truthful Traumatic for Mother and Baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: "This is a strange advertising."
Others defended the advertisement and a woman said that you found the song "urcomically".
“I think that is a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought me one if I'd still be quiet.
When I was pumping, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to translate it.
This is a brilliant product," wrote a person.
Another person commented: “It’s a wise advertising aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or at toilets) and feel like “sweet”.
This is not advertising for or against the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discreet pumps in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps are showing themselves to feel like milk cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely cloudless, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a still-BH, so women get the freedom to move to keep their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, explained: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a sudden and provocative market launch.
By comparison with standing mothers with milk cows, we wanted to address all the challenges associated with milk pumps and at the same time to reflect the incredible feeling of freedom that enables the new pump.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump runs into the strike lines.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski appeared a double mother on the catwalk while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly and quietly brought to a tent town at the Texan border
The number of internally displaced children is as high as ever, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively similar, among other things, where stronger rhetoric and measures of the Trump government have made it more difficult to bring children into contact with caregivers.
Traditionally, most administrators were illegal immigrants themselves and are now afraid to become even the target disc for an exhibition when they report to pick up a child.
In June, as the Federal authorities announced, potential administrators and other adult members of their household had to give their fingerprints and share these data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs Immigration and Customs Force, declared before the Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of people who had complained about the care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior entry into the criminal register.
“Approximately 80 percent of the persons who are either a manager or a member of a household of a manager are illegally staying in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we will continue to persecute these people," Albence explained.
In order to be able to process the cases of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules which, according to the employees of the accommodation in some children, required to appear within a month instead of 60 days after the court's hearing, which was the standard before.
Many will appear by video switch and not personally to appear before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the case of negative decisions, the person will be quickly removed.
The longer these children stay safe, the more likely it is according to the information of the accommodation staff and reports that have been announced from the system in the last month that they are afraid and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreaks.
Defenders say that these concerns are reinforced by a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there signs that a child has problems will be overlooked because of the size.
They also explained that traumata, which many of the children are already suffering, could be strengthened if they were brought to a tent town without emotional preparation or sufficient time to decide with friends.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish “testing troops”
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in the middle of the eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces were unlawfully on the Syrian ground in the face of the fight against terrorism and were "treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he explained to the assembly.
Moualem pointed out that the "war against terrorism was almost past" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus "will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are clean" both by terrorist groups and "even illegal foreign presence".
The United States has set up some 2,000 troops in Syria who train and advise, mainly, both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces, who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 ground troops in the war-based country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions were laid down for their return and that he accused “some Western countries” of ‘dispersaling irrational fears’ and of keeping refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable the return of their homes," he said.
"They are actually policing a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warned that no building aid would be granted to Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition in order to end the war.
The UN diplomats explained that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last large rebel hilly Idlib represents the possibility of pre-launching political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a widespread offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia into the province in which three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military action against the Shihadites, including combatants of the Nusra Front, which is "removed".
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene as soon as possible the first meeting of a new committee that consists of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem called the conditions of the Syrian Government for its participation in the Committee and stated that its work should be limited to "recasting the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his election again in 2020, not how many liberal spectators are likely to end his presidency in advance, an official survey or a scandal.
This would certainly be "the most dramatic final of a presidency of all times".
So far, there are no signs that the viewers have been sitting there.
Since 2014, the key rates for the best transmission time at CNN have doubled to 1.05 million more than doubled and at MSNBC almost spread to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News achieves an average of 2.4 million viewers for the best time to send, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBCs "The Rachel Maddow Show" conducted the auction rates with up to 3.5 million viewers at evenings with important news.
"This is like a fire that magically attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," says Neal Bear, Showrunner, the drama series "Designed Survivor" on TV broadcasts by a cabinet member, the president, after an attack destroys the capital.
Nell Scovell, an old-fashioned Comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Five Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
"He said, 'because he makes me laugh'""" told me Scovell.
The chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, Washington's stories can, in contrast to all that is on TV, determine the future of the principle decision on removals Roe v. Wade, the possible integration of families and the health of the global economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, there is also an informed citizen who is aware of having seen six hours of an expert round, who is discussing, over Bob Woodwards, the use of sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 expensive bombjacke from Straustenledleder (de Washington Post says that a "part of clothing rich in self-assessment") or the effects of Stormy Daniel's rich description of Trumps, um, anatomy.
I'll never be able to see Super Mario with the same eyes again for my part.
“A part of what he does can be felt like a reality show he's chairing every evening,” says Brent Montgomery, chief businessman of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series "The Three From Pfanhaus", about Trump's rotating occupation and daily performances (a fight with the football league NFL from the Zaun, Kim Jong-un prize).
You can't afford to miss a sequence, otherwise you won't come any more.
When I arrived this week, there were 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he broke in and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He just couldn't get out of the screen, not when Judge Brett Kavanaugh was in a position to speak before the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy missions and the people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turned out that they were right."

Donations of money flown the narrowest races around the congress at the mid-elections
It is a little surprising that the 17th election district of Pennsylvania is overrun by donations, thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of the electoral district, which led to two officials standing in the race around the same seat.
The recently redesigned Pre-City Bezirk in Pittsburgh allows the Democratic Conor Lamb to enter, who won his seat in another district during a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb is against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is strongly intertwined with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old districts were moved against the Constitution and manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an exchange of electoral funding between the parties' large financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was announced in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a highly respected special election in March about the 18th election district of the state.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican and won the trumpet there with 20 percentage points ahead.
Politexperts provide easy leadership for the Democrats.
The US examined the punishment of El Salvador for its support for China, but then returned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized, without breaking into major resistance from Washington.
Trump completed a friendly meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama to partner the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", says Heather Nauert, speaker of the Ministry in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in El Salvador's case of criminal measures, which was estimated at $140 million in 2017 for US aid, including for drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed criminal measures, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and killings.
During internal meetings, North and Central American officials moved forward a high-level conference on security and economic well-being, which should follow a similar assembly in the previous year and represent a step forward in the efforts to stop migrants from moving towards the United States.
However, in mid-September, high government officials made it clear that they wished the conference to be held and that the review of criminal measures for El Salvador had ended so effectively.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled as a speaker at the conference in mid-October in order to provide, according to diplomats, a sign of the importance that the Assembly's government can bring.
The three American diplomatic representatives are still and quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new urgent communications or prosecutions from Washington.
A speaker from John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to speak on the basis of anonymity, to the internal discussions.
Their opinions were confirmed by one of the government's close external analysts, who also spoke under the terms of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next major surprise could be the report of the Special Ombudsman Robert Mueller on Trump's possible injustice of justice, for which there are now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller is now allegedly also investigating whether Trump's election team has been conspiring with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If the majority of the congress is changed, Trump will face an organ that forces him to account and at exactly the time when he prepares to go back to the electorate; and perhaps before a jury.
That is a lot of 'cause' and I do not want to say that the Donald Trumps case, or his European pendant, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic we have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938 German officers were willing to carry out a state strike against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of the barbarians who followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unsustainable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are just ahead of several such turning points.
What do we do when Trump dismisss Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, so the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been driving a kitchen in Teufels since last year, reports that he proposed to record the president secretly and speculated about it, as if it was inappropriate for the office.
Rosenstein neglects the presentation of the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly arranged FBI investigation is not complete or fair or is confirmed despite credible charges of sexual abuse and abuse in the office?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a congress that forces the Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we have a long winter ahead.
But I think we're not going to fail because of what I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz from the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to burn Sabath candles on the table with the hooker.

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimisticly in front of the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday in knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remis against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will be transferred to a good position for the qualification of the Group G of the European League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans was unable to get into appearance up to the 2-2 level against Villareal, but he believes that the rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for larger ones.
"This was an important point for us, since Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we could do something about it and we went home with a point.
Perhaps we could have won at the end, but the overall outcome was probably a fair outcome.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we tried in the second half and were then the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, however, this will be a difficult party because they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure that we can go through it with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of feeling factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of old age leads women to sleepless nights.
Although participants in the survey knew exactly how to care for them, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the female participants in the nationwide study indicated that they would talk to their mates about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said to talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-Presidents of the National Insurance Party.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in a timely manner.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you want to be treated, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining the costs.
Get your financial advisor on board: Your advisor can also help you find an opportunity to finance these expenditures.
Your long-term financial decisions may include a traditional maintenance insurance, hybrid capital formation insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Apply legal disputes in the last minute.
Correct a precautionary measure, so that you command a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that health professionals meet your wishes, you should be able to express this yourself.
Consider also a full power for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about taking medicines or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan, so you are ready.
"Not only do financial questions play a role. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.

Men in Ilfracombe repeatedly attacked with air defence
A man was attacked several times with a gun when he went home after a job with friends.
The victim, a man in the fourties, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
Officials describe the shots that occurred around 02:30 British time as "willful act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police were looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, so the authorities were able to increase the number of deaths.
Because of the resulting communication systems, auxiliary forces were unable to receive information from the Dongala government district, an area north of Palu, which is located near the epicenter of the earthquake with the force 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster in Palu.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a region of the north-west of the island of Sulawesi, which extends over a coastal section of over 300 km (180 miles) long.
In the government district, an administrative unit under the province, 299,200 people were estimated in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the Central-Sulawesis economy, in particular for the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickellabbau is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
According to the Indonesian disaster protection authority, Palu and Dongala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
West Dongala was hit by a tsunami in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is on the Seismic Pacific Fire ring, and is regularly visited by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered on 26 December a tsunami that hit 14 countries and cost about 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of it in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands in front of the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with a force of 6,8 shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A earthquake with a force of 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of the West-Sumtra province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres high, which destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake struck the government district of Pidi Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no Tsunami was triggered, but over 100 people died by a stormy building.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the popular Indonesian island of Lombok and in particular requested over 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The Bebe destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested because of the predictions of domestic violence

Tsunami by Earthquakes in Indonesia: one hundred dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The bite, with a force of 7.5, triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Power and communication networks are interrupted and it is expected that the number of deaths will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred shortly before the coast of Central Sulawesis, which is located north-east of the capital of Indonesia Jakarta.
On the social networks, videos circle from the time when the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutor's Office requests rare death sentences for suspects in New York terrorist attacks
The federal prosecutor in New York calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendants in the terrorist attack of New York City, who cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been suspended for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of having used a rented pick-up of the construction market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, in the course of which he rode on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and carried pedestrians and bikers.
In order to justify the death penalty, the defendants must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "targeted" and "conscious" serious bodily injury, that is to say, in the declaration of intent for the claim of the death penalty filed in the southern New York District.
Both charges could be sentenced to death on the basis of the judicial document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court of inquiry, Saipov, filed a indictment in 22 points containing eight charges of murder against the background of organised crime, normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack sought "basic planning and purpose", so the accusers, who carried out the act in Saipov, described as "absolute, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and loss," said the statement.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the South District of New York had not followed a case with the aim of calling for the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was accused of murdering two drug suppliers and was finally sentenced to a life-long prison sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in New York in a federal case was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been accused of conspiracy two years earlier to commit espionage to the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were equipped with the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months after the attack of missing reue, so to speak.
He told me before the investigators that he felt good about what he did, so the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was actually inspired by the fact that he had watched videos of ISIS on his phone, so the indictment.
He also called for police reports to suspend ISIS's custody in his hospital room.
He declared himself innocent in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were “depressed of course” because of the decision of the State prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of a debt in exchange for a life-long release penalty without the possibility to accept the trauma that will only prolong all the parties involved”, Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party asks NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the power of the people" today during a protest in the course of the Tories conference.
Ukip's former leader stated that politicians "have to feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics, while a representative of Theresa May's party suggested that Farage lead negotiations with the EU.
The conservative back banker Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be outside" if Farage Brexit was minister.
The challenge facing May in the reconciliation of its deeply controversial party was reinforced by the participation of members of your party, who are for a stay in the EU, in a separate demonstration against the Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems in keeping her compromise plan Cheques in spite of attacks by Brexit's supporters, Brexit's giants and the EU.
They agreed that despite their reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the Chaos.
Bone explained at the “Leave Means Leave” demonstration in Solihull that “Checkers on the Mull” belong.
He suggested that Farage should have been named a peer and transferred to him the responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible for this, we would already be out,” he explained.
The Commissioner of Wellingborough added: “I will stand for Brexit, but Cheques belongs to the mill.”
He stressed his opposition to the EU: "We have not fought in world wars to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected claims that the public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: “The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to stay in the EU is absolutely wrong.”
The Brexit Deputy of Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also on the demonstration and reported: “I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is untrustworthy in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is untrustworthy in our own party and with our activists who actually walk through the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Please enter the checkers and start listening.’
In a brief message to May, she continued: “The Prime Minister will keep her jobs if you keep her promises.”
Farage stated in a statement that politicians need to “ feel the pressure”, that they should be in a position to mislead the 2016 referendum decision.
“This is now a question of confidence between us, the people, and our political class”, said Farage.
“They are trying to deceive the Brexit, and that is why we are here today to say to them, ‘You are not coming from it’.
He continued: “I want you to let our political class, who is just before betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We mobilise the power of the people of this country, which will bring us to victory in the referendum and never come to peace, unless we are an independent, self-regulatory, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit-genener marched through Birmingham, before taking a two-hour call in the city center.
A few activists waved banners of the Tories Against Brexit Group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was called to life at the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the tories that had security problems with a party app when opening the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for smooth, free trade without frontiers in Ireland,” says Adonis.
"That's a farce.
There is just no good Brexit’, he added.
Warren plans to “examine” the presidential candidacy.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren explained that after the elections in November, she will "examine the presidential candidacy".
The Boston Globe reports that the massachust democracy on Saturday spoke about its future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts.

It was the focus of speculations that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was since Trump's entry to office. Meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format.
One of the people present asked her if you would like to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be for women at the time "to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top."

The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m. in the morning of Eastern Time.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the Campus of Southern University.

Great price from Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after his team left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time that Valteri Bottas landed on Saturday in qualifying before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Stallord of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the Pole position, Botta's success was a good start and it was almost as he led Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton in traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went a round later into the box and landed behind the Vettel, but took it to Hamilton after a short wheel-and-wheel-manover, where the Ferrari-pilot was opposing the inside to take out the risk of two movements in order to defend the third curve.
Max disappeared on one of the back seats of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round in place seven.
He was then for a large part of the fastest race, as he kept on his tires to finish quickly and pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He finally went in the 44th round in the box and failed to take a step in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen ended up as a fourth.
It was a difficult day when Valteri had been doing a great job all weekend and how a real gentleman had acted when he was supposed to leave me.
The team has done excellent work to win a double victory," says Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein at a election event on Saturday, which held the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which he proposed sexual abuse to the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, not to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford's statement in front of the Senate's Justice Committee did not speak directly, but commented that the proceedings in the Senate show that people are "common, wicked and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and angry and mean and rude," said the President.
“If you look at the leaks and then say, “Oh, that wasn’t me.
I wasn't."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, one moment, please.
If we had it... no, we didn't publish it," he added by postponing the senator's voice.
Feinstein was given the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and it was published in early September. However, Feinstein argues that the leak comes from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't publish your story," Feinstein explained to the committee, according to The Hill.
"They asked me to keep the letter secret and I replied to their request for confidentiality."
Your dementia seemed not to be good for the president, who said on Saturday evening at the election event: “I tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense of the right-wing candidate, who was subjected to sexual abuse by three women, the Democrats would use the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain the power with all means.
One sees the community, the wickedness, they do not worry about who they hurt when they get under the wheels to get power and control," said the President Mediate.

Over 800 people die and many are lost after the island of Sulawesi was terrorized on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong remnants are still to be felt in the region and many people are trapped in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your life, the 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his posts in the heavily waving control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to make sure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely depart.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirat, spokesperson for the Indonesian Air Safety Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, so Australia's ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could rise to several thousand. The disaster protection authority of the country stated that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to rise, as many bodies are still among the drummers, while others cannot be reached”, said the speaker of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.

You've been ready?" So CNN.
Indonesia was already shot this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports from a missing aircraft crash in Lagune
The airline, which conducted the flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports from a missing person after first claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew have been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that they cannot say anything until Saturday afternoon about the stay of a passenger.
The airline requested to work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane was pushed into the water when attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline indicated that on Saturday there were six passengers in the hospital, but they were in a stable condition.
The cause and exact outcome of the accident remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed shortly before the runway in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought that the plane flew out over the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane hit very flat.
"This is a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to water through boiling water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said that the airliners ran into panic and yelled and that he suffered a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that mattresses that worked near the improvement of an installation were driven by an explosive boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane fell in about 30 metres (100 feet) deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network can be found that 111 people have come to life by air carriers registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them are interested in Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the end of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution dismissed its evidence in the renegotiation of a case in which a man was proposed to have banned a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the American Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how by phone calls he rebuilt the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her night of death.
Rowlett said to have received position data from different phones, which showed that Tellis was with Chambers at the night of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, so the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the time he indicated to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he indicated that he had been in Sanford's Pick-Up this night, Sandford said he had lied "when my Pick-Up was in Nashville."
Another objection was that Tellis indicated to have known Chambers at their death date for two weeks.
But phone records showed that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis released some time after Chamber's death their messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He took it out of his life," says Hale.
The defense will likely begin on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the procedure is then before the jury on that day.

Another black?!
New Yorker's girls reported couple because of a release after "racist" SMS
A New York girl accused a couple of being discriminated against after she received a wrong message from her mother, in which she complained that she was "not yet a black person".
The couple struggles to be racist and compared to a 'erpression'.
The double mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she entered her first working day in 2016.
“NOEEEEEEEEEEEEEY, NOT ONE SHOW,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending this message to her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice.
After she recognized her fauxpas, she decided the "painishly touched" Plasco-Flaxman Maurice and claimed that the opened African-American mother had done a bad job and she was expecting a Philippineser instead, so the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her day of work and then sent home with a tumor.
Now Maurice has charged the couple for compensation for the dismissal and makes a claim for compensation for the $350 per day, which they would have been charged for over six months, the job for which they were originally booked, but without a contract, and for which they would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look what you're not doing," she explained on Friday, "I know that discrimination is."
The couple withdrew the racist proposals, and argued that the release of the sensible step was no longer possible because they feared Maurice after they had attacked her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said Ehemann Joel Plasco of the post.
“But would you trust your children in a person who was rude to them, even if it was out of order?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the legal dispute with an "expression" and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was "in a difficult situation".
“Do you want to interest such a person?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the dispute continues, the couple was quickly convicted in the public and urged on social media where they were criticized for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to move into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, had been inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, no problem with it, would have been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death in the last year was "bitterly sweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, which she describes as “very important family member”.
"He was a very quiet man and didn't cry," says Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that makes something special: you are proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington himself responsible for his success."
My daughter died and I had to take her over the phone.
After the country, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to say that it really looks bad and that the doctors gave her little chance,” said Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to decide from her.
And that's what I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications you have given the doctors to keep their heart on the pump, they cry slowly and leave their body.
She had died just before, and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't wait to do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I could not scream or scream because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperous, who was now grieving for the loss of her daughter, went along with the other passengers, who had nothing to do with what she was doing on board the plane.
"No one knew," she said.
I had a headache and tears all the time passed over the waves.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for the neighborhood.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women hang cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost their family through a suicide attempt to keep others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelsey Humphreys were on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers for consulting points.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he began Suizid.
"I don't want parents to feel like I feel every day," she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son managed a promising career as a cook and he had a striking smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They all said that his smiles could light up a room."
However, he announced his job before his death, since he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his 11-year-old brother.
Davis said, "I always fear that this could have an effect."
Davis has designed the maps “to show people that there are people to whom one can go and with whom one can talk, even if he is a friend.
Don't be quiet: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was down or depressed," she explained.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at the bottom of the hill on Christmas. When the children took out their presents, he did not see them in his eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma to her, but that through it they had to say: “There is a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must all continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the swivel while the FBI starts with investigations
"I thought if we could actually get something like this, which he asked, so a temporary and limited investigation, we might be able to get a little intervention," said Flake on Saturday. He feared that the committee in the party state would be "excessive".
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Your wishes can only be based on the timing.
The interim elections on 6 November are only five weeks away. If the Republicans, as expected, cut badly, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush contacted the phone reader to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh. He had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can join at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to decide on equal standing and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean crossings under Kim
The number of North Korean crossings to South Korea has fallen to power seven years ago, such as a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, which is based on data from the South Korean Reunition Ministry, explained that last year 1127 crossings were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers as major factors.
Pjöngang did not speak publicly about it.
The vast majority of North-North crossings are finally offered by South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most fly across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the crossings to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often returns with violence.
The relationship between the north and the south, which is still technically seen in the war, has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State held talks in Pjöngang, which focused on the agreed nuclear negotiations.
This was due to the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June, where they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unarm ourselves alone first," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not fit for the office of the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the representative's house Nancy Pelosi called Judge's candidates Brett Kavanaugh "histories" and said that he was particularly inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could not resist the impression that a woman who had acted in this way would have been referred to as “hysterical”, Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate’s Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally disappointed all the charges that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he screamed almost and stood out in tears when he spoke of his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the charges against him a "great and coordinated murder", organised by Liberals, who were furious about Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, since she showed that he was pre-elected against the Democrats.
"I believe that he has explained himself in these statements and in the manner in which he brought about the Clintons and the Democrats, even for trivial reasons," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to expel Kavanaugh from the office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also inappropriate for his current court posts," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi continued that as a democrat, she was concerned with possible decisions by Kavanaughs against the Affordable Care Act or the decision to withdraw Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh asked whether he would review certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, pre-eminent person who goes to this court now and expects us to say, ‘I’m not wonderful’, says Pelosi.
Women must use it as a weapon.
It is a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcrowding anger, and it does not get out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Stein told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she was also crying when she was angry but developed a technique. If she gets angry and starts to cry, tell her to the person she said: “They may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps talking.
I found it great."
Tremens are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are totally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is a former job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I wept because of an indescribable anger and by an older woman, a cooler manager, before whom I had always been a little scared, wrapped up in a stairwell.
"Let her never see you cry," she told me.
“They don’t know that you’re zinc powder.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy with you because they think you've gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was acquired on board a ship named Monkey Business in an exceptional business and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schreeder wondered that there was no reason to consider the idea of the presidential candidacy itself.
"That was not a well thought-out decision," she told me 30 years later with a smile.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Schneewittchen and the seven twins’.
Since the election campaign had already progressed, it was behind the acquisition of funds and it was difficult not to run if it was not to get $2 million.
It was a searchless fight.
She found that some of her supporters, who spent $1,000, supported their campaign only with $250.
"Do they believe I get a discount?" she asked.
In the speech in which she announced not to start an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration over the system that the acquisition of funds and the direct address of the voters instead of the delegates, as well as the anger over sexism, that she stood close to the tears.
"You could have assumed that I suffered a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“I could have believed that the pocket-tub manufacturer Kleinex was my sponsor.
I still remember asking myself what they'd write on my gravestone.

Why Beijing could benefit from the US-China trade war
The opening of the trade war between the US and China were ominous. Although the battle is not long past, Beijing could benefit from a dig between the countries in the long term, my experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, celebrated the first warning committee in the beginning of the year when he placed important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with fines.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new fines on goods worth $200 billion, thus effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China into the United States.
Peking went back in the same way every time and recently raised fines from five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China swore to respond to any US measure, and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon rise.
To move Washington in, it would mean giving up, but a public technique against the United States would be too much fun for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, my experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the long-term effects of the trade war by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries is, in fact, much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized,” says Abigail Grace, a scientific employee who focuses on Asia at the memorial factory Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'prepared' for the return of refugees, so the Foreign Minister
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by the war over seven years.
In an address before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem explained that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he explained.
The government rebuilds the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to allow normality to change.
All conditions are now set for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily and life-based objectives.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that there would be no acceptance of aid granted by countries that had supported the rebellion.
Europe won a victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 and won the team USA with an end of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points that it needed to defeat the United States.
The American Star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with most of the tournament, reduced his impact on the 16th train (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all its rounds and became one of 4 players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was hit at 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so incredibly happy to regain the pocal.
It is about the team and I have been happy to have made a contribution," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He continues to reach his countryman John Rahm, who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods at the individual meetings on Sunday 2:1.
I am so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, whom I've been following on TV since I was a child," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A remarkable statistics for one of the biggest players of all times who won 14 important titles and is only overcome by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to find the fairways all week long, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have placed high-quality services throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time this morning when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
Take it off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players had a good performance.
We will regroup, I will speak with the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
