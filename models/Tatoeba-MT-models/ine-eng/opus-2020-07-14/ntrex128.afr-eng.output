Members of the Wallarian Assembly worried they're going to look like shit.
There is a consensus among some members of the meeting on the proposal that their title be changed from AM to MWP (for a Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Walloon Parliament.
Members of the political spectrum are afraid that it can trigger a ridicule.
One member of the Workers' Party says his group is concerned because "it's rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wallis: In Wallies means twp stupidity and pwp means disbanding.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru some say the group as a whole is "not happy" and proposed alternative.
A member of the Wallarian Conservative Party says his group is "acceptable" about the change of name, but noted that it is a short speech from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of stupid or stupid.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed as the Yorkshire-English statement of the letter to you.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently designing legislation to introduce the amendments, said: "The final decision on any description of what is called members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wallis 2017 gave the Wallish meeting the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received broad support to appoint the meeting a Wallian Parliament.
As for the AM's title, the Welsh Parliament Members of the WMP Committee chose, but the MWP option received most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM's seeming to be proposing alternatives, but the fight to get consensus can be a major pain for the president, Elin Jones, who must, within weeks, propose a bill on the changes.
The legislation on reforms will also include other changes to the way in which the meeting is working, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the draft committee system.
AM's will be the last to say in the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum was organized in an attempt to eliminate a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself had a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long demanded that the name of its neighbor in the north represent a claim in his area and has repeatedly been captured against his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said that he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain, however, that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's get quiet because churches in Harlem trouble
"History talks, says the old people I spoke to, there was a curve and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Not one of the two is there anymore."
He says that the disappearance of crows is understandable.
"People socialize today in other ways," he says.
"Kroe are no longer close family rooms where people go regularly."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from boat sales is not going as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the type of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining refugee camps.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that's why the day that these churches completely closes even draws near, because most of the people who enter these condominiums probably won't become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation near to worship took over the title of the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by E.E. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from retailers in 125th Street, a main street for purchases in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson’s members planned to rebuild it, they ordered the carilion.
Erev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the charilion "the poor people's watches."
The expert who played the carilion in July called it something else: "a Cultural Fund" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the first carilon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger carilon at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been playing at St. Martin's for the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some introduced by the church's leaders, others by the Episcopal bishops.
The church hall, the congregation’s governing body, which consists of laymen, wrote to the bishop in July with concern that the bishop “try to pass the cost” to the church hall, although the church hall was not involved in appointing the architects and contractors who sent the bishop.
Some congregation members complain of a lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Haai injured 13-year-olds on bed smoke in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured him on the first day of the California bed season, officials say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been drowning with friends for a half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help, and then with a group rushing closer to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the excitement of a first catch, but then he realizes "that he calls, 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His whole key leg was open," Hammel saw when he came out with the boy.
"I called out that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flew to the Council Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as criticism.
It is not known what type of hacker is responsible for the attack.
Life jacket. Larry Giles said at a media session that a shark was observed a few weeks ago in the area, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his upper body.
Officials closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for expansion to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams are fighting department store-type beauty walks that have been managed by a specialist assistant.
As part of a major expansion in the UK’s £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods return, the larger beauty steps in 11 shops across the country will be tested and if this is a success the next year will be taken to more shops.
The investment takes place in beauty while supermarkets search for ways to fill racks once used for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will for the first time include trading such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also find more space with trade-specific areas similar to those seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunchs its Boutique Grimming series so that the majority of products are waving-friendly - something that has increasingly younger buyers insist on.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, of which the first week in Croydon opened in South London and a second which will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet purchases and a move to smaller amounts of food purchased daily at local malls mean that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive Officer of Sainsbury's, said that the shops are already becoming more like department stores when the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products against the Aldi and Lidl dump shops.
Sainsbury's has put Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and also announced a number of Habitat sales points since it had bought both of these chains back two years, which, according to their wholesale sales, strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The previous Supermarket attempt to renew its beauty and appetite departments failed.
Sainsbury's in the early 2000s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the relationship ended after an argument on how to distribute the profits from the monkeys within its shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago, his 281-store pharmaceutical business for £125m sold to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical Chain.
It says that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing an extensive range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's trade director, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty steps to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also placed in special-level colleagues who will be at hand to offer advice.
Our range of trade names is designed to meet every need and the attractive environment and comfortable places means that we are now an area-wide beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones' rage after Holly Willoughby withdraws £11 million match
Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones ran away after TV provider Holly Willoughby pulled her to a £11 million match with his lifestyle trade mark business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their housekeeping and future business name, True,.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trade name.
This Morning Provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she had withdrawn her.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones furiously by withdrawing at the last moment their profitable lifestyle trade mark business - to focus on her own huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Bronne says Jones was "suffering" when TV's golden girl Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities -- worth up to £1.5 million -- meant that she could no longer spend enough time on their home- and-coming names, True.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trade name and would, according to a dedicated Willoughby’s famous £11 million fortune doubled.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she had left True, Jones climbed on a beam and sold Britain to one of his holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority at far.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her was totally stupid.
No one could believe that Tuesday was about to happen, so close to the announcement.
There's a store full of goods at the Marlow headquarters, standing right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of this Morning provider, one of Britain’s most money-inspiring stars, the firm can hunt millions out of the bag as a result of the huge investment in products ranging from kisses and candles to clothing and household clothes, and the possibility that its announcement may even be more slow.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up True in 2016 with Capp and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples have a vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trade brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source near Jones last night said, "We won't comment on his business."
Hard words 'and then we fall in love'
He ridiculed the criticism he was going to get from the news media because he made a comment that some would view as "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his chamber "new-reader voice."
"I gave up nothing."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first conversation in June in Singapore as a major step after the nuclear weaponization of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear weapons were fueled.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said on Saturday, more than three months after the June Leader's Conference in Singapore, leaders at the UN General Assembly said that the North does not see a "corresponding response" of the US to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noticed, the U.S.A. continues with sanctions on which to keep the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic approach to his convention.
"We advance excellent with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions would die.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim led to positive results — ending firefighting tests, helping to free mobile phones, and causing the rest of American soldiers to return home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be Presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stamped arena, we'd have almost 200 people just standing there," Trump said while he pointed out to the crowd right in front of him.
Gulf and Earthquake in Indonesia Destroyed Island, Hundreds Dead
In the course of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs have been told that they are not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population has been kidnapped, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
"In many cases they were unfortunately very clear that they did not ask for international help, which makes it a bit difficult," said me.
Although Save the Children are working to put together a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials would assess the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the earthquake that Indonesia continues to endure, the country is sadly weakly prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not a general face to other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami alert in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life, even though it was a warning of power.
Traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is the best challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to deal with earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the area of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's complex infrastructure a core point of his election campaign and has spent money on roads and railways in vain.
However, Mr. Joko’s administration is being managed by fundraising deficits as he sees reelection in the face next year.
Mr. Yoko is also faced with the pressure of closing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were kidnapped, such as Christian and Muslim gangs, with caps, arrows, and bows, and other primitive weapons on the street.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge spits good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a premium loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xerdan Shaqiri told Sturridge when he was about 30 years away from the Chelsea goal and his team was 1-0 behind.
He pointed the ball to the left before he pushed far to the finish line.
The effort went high above the frame as it swung to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball shot over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and in just the same case.
"It was just to try to get in that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create for myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and bite once and not think too much about it and just spit."
Chelsea was about half-time 1-0 before the Belgian star Eden Hazard recorded a target in the 25th minute.
The Blues' target chopper again played back to Mateo Kovacic in that playroom before he went near the middle field and ingested in the Liverpool-half.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the Middle Ages.
With a beautiful crown on his head, he brought it into the frame for Hazard.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up with a left foot-head near Liverpool's Alison Becker in the last target.
Liverpool runs the battle against Naples at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea comes on Thursday to stand for Videoton in London in the UEFA Europe League.
The fatal increase to 832 in Indonesian tsunamis
The fatality in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunamis rose to 832, the country’s disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped under the rumbling of buildings that struck the earthquake on Friday at an amount of 7.5, and caused fires of up to 20 feet, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was adorned with the ruins of ruined buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after a woman was killed
A murder investigation was sent from a pile after the body of a woman this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 in Grayson Mews in John Street with knives, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police encouraged people in the area who had heard or seen anything to move forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is at an early stage, but I am calling on anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also appeal to any, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on Dashcam film material, to contact us as they can have information that can be inexcusable to us."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found within a property.
In the afternoon, friends who believe that they know the woman at the scene raised questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continued as the police said they were in the process of illustrating the victim’s neighbors.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Citizens are now told that it will take hours before they are reintroduced.
It was heard that a police officer told one man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said, 'it's so ridiculous.'
At 2 nm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officers were allowed inside the cordon to monitor the block of residences.
Anyone with information is asked to connect @MerPolCC to DM, 101 or to connect Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as reference.
Parliament's status of Cromwell is becoming the newest memory match with 'rewrite of history' dispute
His banning will be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "society" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statutes that the shape of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The image storm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s manifold depiction of Cromwell was evidence of 19th - century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still believe to be memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell becomes by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of the parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is determined is that the conflict of the middle 17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as a Protector is also worthy of celebration and reminder."
Chinese Boer Killer Differing
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, only identified by his, "Yuan", was found dead with a cut-off blood-covered slag near a hook at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post Sunday reported.
A pig farmer prepares on 30 May 2005 to inject pigs with explosives at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports Wednesday he traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning her cousin found him dead, and found a door open to a neighbor's cock.
He said there was a big male pig in the hole with blood on his neck.
A forensic investigation confirmed, according to the report, that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer.
"My nephew's legs were bleeding and squeezing," said the nephew, who was called "Wu," quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera material showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4.40 pm to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man is not of Yuan or his nephew.
A brand manager told the Evening New that the pig was closed to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the trademarks negotiate according to claims compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs that have been reported by humans have been reported.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their site in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound peacock arrested a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was threatened by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster".
"They're not playing.
Their pickles, very curious... they're not about to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Nothing from Orkaan Rosa is going to bring widespread heavy rains to the southwest U.S.
As foretold, Orkaan Rosa is weakened as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring floodwaters across northern Mexico and the southwest U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa had windows from 5 a.m. east time from 85 m.p.m., a category 1-orcaan, and was placed 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north of Sunday.
Meanwhile, a struggle over the Pacific begins to form and to move east to the west of the United States. As Rosa Monday approaches Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical moisture northwards to the south-west U.S.
Rosa will bring rain from up to 10 inches [10 cm] in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in response to the approaching drought, tropical moisture will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous cataracts, wastes, and possible land damage in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rainfall figures of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over the largest parts of Arizona.
Chicks are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It would be very unwise to venture into the desert with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause deep - sanded desert rivers to fall and thunderstorms will bring heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching train will bring a little local heavy rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Rainfall rates of more than half a inch are possible, which can cause low waste and smooth fish.
It will be the first rain of the season in the region.
Some widespread tropical rainstorms will leave Arizona on Sundays and early Mondays before the rains increase on Mondays and Tuesdays.
Heavy rains will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the North Pole gets cooler, but the troops remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, numerous summer heats will try to increase and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. October are expected to start warm, with extensive 80s from the Southern Lowlands to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80 ° C] on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance at average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh trial
On Thursday, more than 20 million people looked at the overwhelming testimony of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christian Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political point of death continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-spot: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh beat her in alcohol and tried to pull her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a heart - to - heart witness, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And at times, Nielsen finds it difficult to measure people who look at offices.
To put it in perspective, it's a hearing as big as one for a decisive football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion gazer Kavanaugh had strongly supported his appointment, was all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers in the day's long trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second to 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Concern was still high after the trial.
Flakes were the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was arrested on Friday morning at CNN and CBS where protestors shouted at him when he tried to take a hysterical to a judicial committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes while CNN vividly depicting himself as a coward.
"I'm standing right here for you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flakes said that his office had made a statement and went to the elevator door, saying that he would have more to say to the committee's hearing.
The cable and broadcasting works covered all later living hours when the Judicial Committee would vote on Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would do it only with the understanding that the FBI would look at the allegations against the candidate for the next week, as the Democratic minority requested.
Flake is partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump set up an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British EM May Accused Critics of 'political Games' About Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has criticised her plans to leave the European Union, accused of "political gambling" with Britain's future and the undermining of national importance in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May day on September 29, 2018, for the Conservation Party conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview with her on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued with his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should introduce each other's tariffs was "very ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal killing of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials issued a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the riot.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, reports CBS-filed WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he had killed Wayde.
His bailout was set at $350 000, the lawyer reported.
The judicial office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound at the neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police for their assistance with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanks to law enforcement for his "growth and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
Its average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 backs per match.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball chief Will Wade said the team was "putting in" and "socking" about Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," said Wayde.
Volcanic as Mexico City
As springed from the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern vicinity of Mexico’s capital reached.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican Saturday to stay away from the volcano after recording activity in the crater and recording gas and as early as 24 hours of 183 releases.
The center has multiple rotations and explosions.
Images on social media showed how thin, low - gas windows were covered by motor windows near Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics marked an increase in activity at the volcano, which has reached 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police battles with Catalan separatists for commemorating independence voices
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protests with riot police, and thousands joined in protests to remember the first reminder of Catalonia’s polarizing vote for resignation.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were held back by riot police, they suffocated with eggs and threw powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually wet tourists.
A chair also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their benches to keep the fighting track.
In several hours, pro-independence groups sang on one tone "Don't forget, don't forgive" in comparison with the unionist's cry of "Lank Life Spain".
Forty people were treated for minor injuries caused in the raids reported the local press.
The tension still runs high in the independence community a year after the referendum of October 1st was considered illegal by Madrid but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The electorate voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those against the majority of the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the voice from going through the region.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent a campaign in support of the national police.
The attack continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist movement with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful of the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I've seen my parents cry with joy because they could vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a life-long yet narrow victory in district elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain this year's moment, with many of their most famous leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention in advance of their role in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took up the campaign in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he was going to stand in European parliamentary elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reject the decline in democratic values and the oppression we saw from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after motor against home vasry

A crossbow may also have been shot at some point in the car.
Menga target gives Livingstone 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s First Goal for Livingston Guaranteed Victory
Promotional Livigston surprised Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 contests as a driver of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s goal was proof of the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved with Hibernian to second place.
Gerard's team stayed this season in the Prime Minister's absence and came to stand next week in front of the predecessors of Heart, who are ahead of them eight points.
Rangers were first host to Rapid Vienna in the European league on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone expands their uninhabited race in the division to six matches, with chief Holt who has not yet tasted a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone plays opportunities against bot visitors
Holt's team had to run long before they had set a target, with their roundness that Rangers had all sorts of problems on their necks.
SR broke through, but turned before the target corner, then AL could play wide only after he got closer and CH’s head met across the target corner.
The hosts were pleased to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors with death dramas.
And in this way the decisive goal came.
Rangers took off a refrigerator and Livingstone created an opportunity to join Declan Gallagher and Robinson who together gave Menga the chance to jump and draw a target from the middle of the frame.
At that time, Rangers owned but could not push through the home defense, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern continued in the second half after Alfredo Morelos forced a turn from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was fired by the feet of Rangers' target waiter Allan McGregor and Lithuania had a wide selection to unravel liveston's open game.
Overcrowds repeatedly reached and turned the frame of Livingston, while two fines — after Halket’s challenge of local replacement Glenn Middleton and one for handball — were removed.
Livingston’s ‘Fenomenaal’ – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alaskar Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal games and outcomes for Livingstone.
Up to the last man was excellent; they still exceeded expectations of this lofty job.
Their game style and team have been almost unchanged since their return to the first rank, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was enormous in his manifold defense order while Menga kept on toes for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers, however, were short of inspiration.
As well as they could at times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once could they push through the home team, which is somewhat of a band for Rangers, which they found in the middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed receipts in Keulen
There were smiles and blue air on Saturday (September 29th) when leaders from Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had an impact on issues involving human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan was then allowed to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have called for security reasons to prevent the 25 000-strong crowd from gathering before the mosque, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan fighters – many of their Kurds – also made their voices loud and both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The controversial protests reflect the division of a visitor greeted by some German Turks as heroes and found by others as autocrats.
Deptford Padon accident: Cycling Dies in Fighting with Motor
A bike driver died in a fight in London where a car was involved.
The clash took place around 10:15 BST near the junction of Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The fight comes months after another rider died in a hit-and-step at Children Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and whitewash his neighbors.
Road closures and bus routes were in place, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in attack
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high security prison, the prison said.
On Sunday, around 09:30 BST broke out and was still running at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado Preservers" was called to handle the attacker, which included eight prisoners and was limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to pay attention to a continued incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay behind."
HMP Long Martin hosts more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the chief officer of the prison received hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called to pay attention to serious irregularities in which staff with billiards were attacked.
Orkaan Rosa Dreig Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsflude (Drug Areas Trek Dalk Advantage)
It's unusual that a tropical low pressure hit Arizona but that's exactly what can happen early next week when Orkaan Rosa's remaining energy is moving over the southwest desert and bringing cat flood risks.
For Monday and Tuesday, for western Arizona, the National Warfare has already been issued in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa Tuesday will take a direct route over Phoenix, and by Monday will bring rain.
The National Heritage Service in Phoenix observed in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Orkaan Centre models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon border of Arizona.
Other parts of the South West, including the central Rockies and the Great Come, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly 4 inches.
For those outside of cataracts, Rosa’s rain will likely be a blessing as the region is afflicted by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, this rainfall will probably be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Droogtemonitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona experience extreme droughts, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Orkaan Rosa’s path leads to the approach of land around the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still against hurricane-resistant Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north to 12 miles per hour.
The storm is watering down in the Pacific, so it takes its power off.
So it is expected that its Monday afternoon or evening will reach the country against tropical storms in Mexico.
Rain falls on parts of Mexico can be heavy and contain a significant flood risk.
"The total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to the northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then, as a tropical storm north of Mexico before it moves Tuesday in the early morning, reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression and then move through Arizona and into southern Utah against Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa is a very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the US Southwest," said the National Orcaan Centre.
These rains are expected to cause life - threatening cat flood and torrential currents in the deserts and soil shifts in the mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found at around 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital where he is still in a stable state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any mobile imagery of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh's "sweet under the community, the anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "is lying under the community, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified Thursday before the Congress and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the hearing about her claim.
The president said Saturday the Americans saw that day "the brilliant and the qualities and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most capable legal spirits of our time, a judge with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd West Virginia supporters.
The president referred directly to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing," he said.
That's why I fight for these candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and prevent."
The first important procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected not to be held later than Friday, a senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths due to Indonesian descent, tsunamis, with ever - increasing numbers
At least 384 people were dead and many had washed away when huge waves broke down on beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu on the beach for a feast on the beach when fires broke up from up to six meters (18 feet) high against the sun on the beach, many washed away after their death and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-dimensional earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it dragged cars, stems, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to free the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were displaced to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster relief show many buildings and destroyed shops, broken and broken bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Naskoks shook the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s agency for the evaluation and application of technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s huge shield was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the edge of a long, narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping rooms, and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found where they were trapped under the ruins of ruined buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is close to the earthquake.
Communication "is completely hampered by no information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It is already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday because they did not report that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur imaging material shared on social media, one can hear a man screaming to the people down the street at the top of a building’s hopeless warnings about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes a wall of water hits the beach and sledgehammers and motors.
Reuters could not immediately explain the image material.
The shaking and tsunami caused major power interruptions that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo would visit clearing centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's death rates are up to 800.
It is very severe.
Although World Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in Palu City, where workers were hiding in decoy shelters set up in their office’s courtyard, they were on their way to scenes of destruction, said Dosebah.
They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It is very severe.
Even as relief groups begin to take up the daunting task of launching the disaster relief kit, some people complained that foreign relief workers with many experience are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, stocks, and personnel from overseas can be made up only after the disaster area has been declared to be a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "Well, it's a national disaster," we can open it up for international assistance, but it still has no status."
With the arrival of the second night at Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad stories of natural disasters.
Saturday a little boy was picked up from a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman for two days under a puin was stuck with her mother's corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the director of the Indonesian National Wall Screens Team, finished two of the lost Wall Screens Weapons for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those who were arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"If a senior in the valley-screen field I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon relates how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media under the valve screen community, he desperately sent whatsapp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were only answered with one gray mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think it means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thie steals $26,750 when refilling OTM at Newport on the Livee
The thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink's worker who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Livee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The car driver was about to empty an OTM in a entertainment complex and prepare to deliver more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press statement.
While he was busy, another man "runs from behind the Brink's worker" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity must contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name — to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The beings previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has for a long time named Ye and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurs before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new Yandhi all.
He replaced Ariana Grande with the program that cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the program's manufacturer.
In addition to the fact that it is a summary of his current professional name, West has in the past said that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio provider Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of known rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was already known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, has either finished with or without a link and letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use force against civilians
Mexican newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised to never use military power against civilians in the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the force to kill the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left - handed student movements were posted throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those studying and opening free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities drew youth to gangs.
U.S.A. must double KI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. must double the amount spent on research in this field, the investor and KI practice Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple, said.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government have made KI announcements, even recently the U.S. has made an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China announced their plan: their goal of being the No. 1 in KI innovation by 2030.
"Double the KI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in KI," Lee said.
The duplication of funding can double the chances that the next major KI performance in the US will be achieved, Lee said in a maintenance interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Synovation Ventures, which was placed in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a KI system that hit the highest approved U.S. Othello player and later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and President of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions of the US government, such as the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotic challenge and asked when the next one is going to be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government seats, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporate wes," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have in recent years appointed influential individuals from other universities to work on KI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to support US KI's efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in KI," he said.
In July 2017, China’s Council of State issued its next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a joint centre for artificial intelligence aimed at involving friends from the business and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Ceur committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently charging more than $100 million per year in KI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence came under fire for months.
Macedonians vote in preference or have to change country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an action that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership boats for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that their northern neighbouring country's name represents a claim in the field and has refused permission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycotting campaign doubted whether the attendance would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum stamp read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it is a price that can be paid to seek permission for Macedonia, one of the countries that came from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough parliamentarians said that they would accept the outcome of the vote to decide.
The change of name will require a second party in Parliament.
The State Election Committee said that by 1 nm, there were no reports of maladies.
However, the rise was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote as a result of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elector in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and his son Dusko, present their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country’s name that will work the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Prior to the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small increase and brought chairs to the tent set by those going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the great majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he issued his vote.
He said a "yes" output would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said that they would.
For the referendum to be successful, the rise should be 50 percent plus one vote.
A return in the referendum will be the first serious return to the policy of a pro-West government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates throughout Brighton defense for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have eliminated the Brighton defense in Manchester City’s 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentine goalkeeper received a ring from the middle field.
He chased between three Brighton defenders before he hit the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green obstacles.
He crossed at one more defender before he passed several others on the edge of the Brighton target.
He then pushed a finger to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English predictor used his first touch in the hook to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat the Brighton target guard Mathew Ryan with a spear to the right side of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are happy that he has set a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premierliga fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area on that game.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had some contact before he led Sterling to the remotest corner.
The Sky Blues foretold the ball in the net just before he was across the back.
City trip Hopenheim in Campioneliga Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherger wants to play worse against Rockies
With the Nationals who are out of the game, there is not much reason to force another start.
But the always-competent Scherzer wants to accept on Sunday the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still play-implications for the Rockies, which has a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies got at least a promo selection place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday morning, but still wants to capture their first division title.
"Although we don't play for anything, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point of me this year in the face.
Why would I not want to participate in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their first player for Sunday, but it is reportedly favourable to release Scherzer in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have his 34th beginning, had a throwing exercise session Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
Washington's lawyer is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 extracts in 220 2/3 over this season.
Trump held conventions in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation around his High Court Choice Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid - term elections.
"All we've done is at the game in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the big, big – I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing and that's why I fight for these candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump went on, "A man sees this ugly, ugly radical group of Democrats, a man sees it now.
And now they are determined to take back the power by any means that they may do, seeing the community, the lust of concupiscence.
They don't give to him who hurts, on whom they should walk, to gain power and control; that is, to whom they desire, power and strength: we will not give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "stand up and prevent."
"And a man sees it over the past four days," he said, and called the Democrats "crazy and common and curious and false."
He referred to the name of the Senate’s judicial committee’s high - ranking Deanne Feinstein, who received hard sentences from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, I'm waiting one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Employers' party is no longer a broad church.
It is unbearable to those who say what they think
When Momentum’s activist in my local party voted to place me under a censorship, it wasn’t just a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a line of Labor Party LPs to whom it was said that we weren't welcome – all because we said what we thought.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she stood up to anti-Semitism in an unprecedented way.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for being different from Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, of irony, of similar issues that Jeremy had different with previous leaders.
The announcement to the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For the most part of my eight years as the local Labour Party LP, it was exactly what Friday’s AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, it is not today the display of many meetings and the promise of "friendlyer, more favorable" politics has long been forgotten, if ever it began.
It became increasingly evident that different views were not tolerated within the Labour Party, and each opinion was judged on the basis of whether it was acceptable for the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I had previously thought shared similar political views began to expect me to make a U-turn and take up positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with – whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I'm saying -- there's a triad of shell language on social media that asks me not to be re-elected, rejected politics from the core, and to tell me that I shouldn't be in the Workers' Party.
And that is not just my experience.
In fact, I am happier than my colleagues because the comments I am directed to be political.
I have a lot of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but never fear away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of injury were normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the Workers Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every "mose of untrustworthy" or change of selection rules, the party becomes stronger.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so expressive, and then I'll be "ukei."
But I did not participate in politics to do so.
Since I joined the Workers Party 32 years ago, encouraged by the Thatcher government's neglect that literally left my state high school dropouts, I tried to fight for better public services for those who needed it most – whether as a local council member or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused about my political positions and areas where I differ from the present leadership.
To those who stood before the mission on Friday, I can only say that with the country that sends on a Brexit that is going to damage all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to seize time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Workers Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my electors, or they are now members of the Workers' Party: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats from being re-elected or political advantage will stop me from doing what I believe in your best interests.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Unsurpassed Father Over
Two late threes may have pulled the final outcome slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderful-imaginative Tennent's Premiership contest of the day.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard, the only uninhabited team of ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chance, that carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be satisfied.
"We have so far been tested in our competitions and we are still uninhabited, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honor Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, divided by Frazier Climo, made Air ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was made available for the war by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot recorded an undisputed three.
Climo increased Ayr's origin with a penalty head, just before he, just before the rest of the day, divided a solo trim to make it a 17-5 break for Ayr.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, split by Baggot, reduced the backbone to five points.
There was a long pause for a serious injury at Ruarid Knott that was worn off on a portable, and from the beginning Ayr enlarged the promontory with a Stafford McDowall-three, divided by Climo.
Ayr's observer Captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose used the extra player with an unspoiled three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a very pressy game.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he killed for Climo without the ball, and MacPherson from the penal station pushed the ball to death after the next Ayr release.
Climo cut it, as he also almost did it from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong got his target head and sent Fly Gregor Henry away for the fifth team of the home team.
Still Game star seems to approach new careers in restaurant business
Still Game star seems to move to the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was designated as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with old comedy nephew Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next nine seasons would be the final of the program, and it seems that Kiernan is preparing for life to Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Aföringmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun wanted to get involved in Kiernan at Glasgow's "floating restaurant industry".
'The sea is ours': surrounded by Bolivia hope court will reopen to the Pacific
Matrose patrols a mass-covered fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sailboat.
Fleet bases from Titicaca More to the Amazon with plaice with the slogan: "The sea is right ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the landscaped Bolivia is the reminder of the coastline that they lost in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century to Chile, as fresh as the need to reinvigorate the Pacific.
That hope is probably the highest that it has been in decades, while Bolivia waits for a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1st, after five years of talks.
"Bolivia has the moment, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course expects the outcome with a positive attitude." Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH statement on large screens all over the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia's claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president – who next year faces a controversial fight for reelection – also depended on Monday's ruling.
"We are near to return to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor — and that if so, it will change little.
The Dutch-based United Nations body has no power to recognise Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's verdict is only six months away, shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s cause, the past four years may have slowed down.
"The issue of access to the sea was cut off by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric got baptized any remaining Chilean goodwill, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to conduct close talks.
In 1962, the two countries sold out late ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to end "a 139 years of differences with repetitive benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crucifix.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons won't come unless they can trust USA
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to fulfill the promises made during a conference in Singapore between the competing countries’ leaders.
His remarks follow to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently on the edge to resume nuclear diplomacy, which reached a dead point, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a dream image that continued sanctions and US caption to a declaration that ended the Korean War will also bring the North on its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the statement without first taking significant steps to disarm Pyongyang.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second consultation.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about making a distance from an arsenal that considers the country the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump consultation.
Parisian fashion displays reveal the latest series of large head coverings on the way to the shops near you
If you want to enlarge your head collection or completely refuse the sun, you do not need to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne announced a series of thinly oversized head coverings at their SS19 collection on the run-up that admired the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Exterior improbable guards passed through this summer Instagram and these designers have prepared their perfunctory creations over the course of time.
The flashlighter by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a quadruple wide edge that hit the models' heads.
Other high attendances included vat membranes decorated with jewelry, a magic hat and even a pineapples – but it is not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also announced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had elaborate lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high couture.
One creature looked like a shrieking device, with a snorkel and thick glass, while another looked like a melted roomie.
And if you continue the great fashion, it is your happy day.
Stylish viewers predict that the huge shield may be on the way to the shops near you.
The vast range follows briefly on the hooks of 'La Bombay', the stork with a two-foot wide edge seen on all's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultuistic label behind the extremely impractical hat spread over socials has sent another great creation over the course – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the silk-dressed model that wore it.
The burnt orange raffiasak, finished with raffiafractions and finished a white leather handle on the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Famous styler Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large heights and beach bags in shops for the next summer – as the designer made such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the request for overcoming incoming ones.'
John Edward: Language skills needed for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have a ritual performance of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with a number of excellent exams, only strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community companies.
With more than 30,000 schools across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that world languages continue to be a popular and desirable profession in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, he will go to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exams, we can see that languages above are the league tables with the highest success figures in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young adults will no doubt need in the future.
Languages now have the same reputation as the STEM fields (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Committee on Professions and Skills found in 2014 that of the reasons for their difficulty in filling posts, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Hence, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely employment opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what course a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically be placed above the competition.
According to a YouTube survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and France was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is now so important to teach language in today’s children.
To learn a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach what is considered essential for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest is, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be recognized at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still of great importance for the country's future, and therefore it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must really be seen as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and hospitality to Scotland’s young people.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will set up Sunday for San Diego Lakes
The watch is almost over for adherents to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakes.
Laker's chief Luke Walton announced that in Sunday's opening match against the Denver Nuggets will play in San Diego.
But exactly how many minutes he is going to play, still need to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Laker's reporter Mike Trudell argued that James would probably play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six games in the pre-season program.
"I don't need pre-season battles at this stage in my career," he said.
Trump's West Virginia convention, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening a flagship election convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It Trump’s first of five scheduled collections in the following week, including stops at friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote now held for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming election because the Republics are in danger of losing control of the Congress when it is voted in November.
How long is Trump's plot in West Virginia tonight and how one looks at it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 nm. ET this evening, Saturday September 29, 2018.
You can see below through live stream to Trump’s collection in West Virginia.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's hearings for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense about charges of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote held for a week while the FBI was investigating.
However, the main focus of this surplus is to help the republics facing difficult elections in November.
So President Trump's campaign said that these five sets of next week were encouraged to "visit volunteers and supporters while Republicans tried to protect and enlarge the majority they had in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Controlling the Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy field season," a spokesman for the Trump Field Strategy, who refused to call his name, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, can supporters withdraw from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the stand.
"It's not for Morrisey a good sign that the president must come to give him a jump at the vote," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryderbeker 2018: The team of the U.S.A. shows that they have the courage to keep the hope alive when entering Sunday’s single game
After three one - side sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryderbecher needed.
The floating slender of moment is a completely different sports concept but one in which players believe in total hearts, and certainly in competitions like this.
Where, then, would they say that the moment is now?
"They've gone ahead with six points and now it's four, so we carry it as a little moment, I reckon," said Jordan Spieth when he ran away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead, and twelve more that are played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is much to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each recorded three points of four.
Spieth was deadly from the pit to the dirt fields and led by his example.
Those scoreboards got harder as his rounds progressed and he thought of a critical set to win the game four completely equals while he and Thomas were after two rounds with two backs.
She says what the game won for them on 15 was greeted with a similar cry, the kind that tells a man that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You really just have to pull everything out and worry you about your own competition," said Spieth.
That’s all those players are going through.
18 chicks to print their stamp.
The only players who have more points over the past two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of the Ryderbeker.
Europe’s single but supportive couple got four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't keep one on Saturday afternoon about bananas, but they also kept one on Saturday morning about bananas as well as during the last nine Friday mornings.
That ball, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this overwhelming crowd, confirms that they are the players that should be hit Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can highlight a potential European victory when the sun drops over Le Golf National.
Select both at the same time or at different pits.
However, it is still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short matches with Sergio Garcia, the four - baller in the morning, when he played with Alex Noren.
One keeps track of the track and two doubles on the front nine left the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not even get close.
Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-balls and four-players are so exciting to keep out of touch because of the interaction between the pair, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way in which a strategy can turn into a perspective.
So far, Europe has always played better than a team and has taken the lead significantly on the last day, but this four-game session also showed that the team of the US had the courage for the fight that some, especially at home, had doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after they have come out of Saturday's four-ball and four-playing games.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a challenging Tiger Woods to take their count to four points so far at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to preserve the trophy that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, won the series 3-1.
The U.S.A. had more resistance in the four games and won two matches, but they did not allow the backfire.
Jim Fury’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single games to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, which after a sensational weekend called "Moliwood", are just the second couple in the history of the Ryderbeker who recorded four points after their first four matches.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they played excellently together to win a pope Woods and American novel Bryson Dechambreau with an even convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, sometimes showed flash of brilliantness but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and four-games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rest during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four-games to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopka -- which is the first and third on the world ranking.
On a pleasant day, however, Europe with a little wind south-west of Paris did not always get their sense.
Jordan Spieth who won a large tournament three times and Justin Thomas placed the mark for the Americans with two points.
They signed a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four-games after they lost the first two puppies.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder-beker has a team recovered from a four-point retreat when they enter the single game, even though Fury's team just had to play on a match to keep the trophy because they already hold it.
After two days of being the second best, however, it does not seem that they will be facing an attack on Sunday.
North Korea says they'll certainly not unarm untrustworthyly.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions exacerbated their mistrust from the United States and that the country would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world’s annual General Assembly that in recent years North Korea has met "significant charity measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear testing site and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see any corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not unarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated over Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons by which North Korea will be rewarded if it takes gradual steps, his words seemed meaningfully by not rejecting unilateral removal of nuclear weapons unconditionally as Pjongang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit meeting between a US president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore when Kim undertook to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised security for North Korea.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pyongyang should first cease its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted attempts to mitigate strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in an urgent way, and even object to the 'explanation of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions increase our distrust."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, on which the U.S. leader earlier this week drew attention to the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings during the last five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party in this issue about the destruction of nuclear weapons was South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead point."
The tone of Ri's speech was, however, dramaticly different than last year, when he told the UN's General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's fire arrows would be directed to the U.S. country mass after "Mr. Bose President" Trump for Kim called a "firefieldman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to destroy North Korea "fully," Kim greatly praised for his courage because he had taken steps to disarm, but he said that much work should still be done and that sanctions should still be there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a schedule for this, and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia feel that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
But, the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said Thursday to the UN Security Council: "The application of sanctions by the Security Council must be zealous and uninterrupted until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unilaterally stepped up sanctions against North Korea in an effort to raise funding for Pjongang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the outside of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea this year three times, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pjongang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him only hours later that he had made "obligatory demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon to break down a missile character and also a core complex if the United States "corresponding measures".
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he wanted to see are security assurances that Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course of rest
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all its pre-graduate students to get more sleep in an effort to study the growing macho culture by working on caffeine powered 'full-night sessions'.
An academic found that students at the world’s top university are often inconceivable when it comes to basic principles of how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had told her how important it was to sleep--which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered this year for the first time, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to implement the course after finding that students were seriously asleep during the week.
The hour of the course involves a few interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, practice shoes and books to tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by the lack of sleep and the importance of a sleeping shower.
In another section participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer can be increased.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know--just as you have the right to know what its health effect is to choose to smoke cigarettes,' added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to 'student all night' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and ever increasing pressure on students meant that sleeping is a growing problem.
To make sure you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said--even to avoid it to put on weight, because sleep taking the brain into a starving mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he walked one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to train him for a campus course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students consider it to set an alarm for them when they are going to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effect of 'blue light' that is emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circular rhythm and lead you to trouble touching the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Target of Menga Overcoming Gerard’s Men
Rangers experienced another sarcasm of road sickness when Dolly Menga's target head, Steven Gerrard's incoherent team, took care of a 1-0 low.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February's 4-1 season at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only awarded Gerrard his second defeat in 18 contests as a driver so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which ran freely in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga took seven minutes before rest, and it didn't seem as if a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingstone climbs to the third and is only behind Hibernian on purpose.
And there can be further difficulty for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown away.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that crashed by Ayr after the end of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been in his noppies in the way his well-trained team had smeared their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingstone did more when they had the ball.
They had to record after just two minutes when Menga’s first detachment, Scott Pittman, passed on to Allan McGregor’s goal, but the midfield player opened up his big chance.
A deep chill by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only spit at the back end.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their games in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he had to get a penalty at the quarterpoint when he and Steven Lawless were fighting, but divorce judge Steven Thomson had turned away the Colombian requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but the former Ibrox targetkeeper Liam Kelly was severely beaten by Lassana Coulibally's headshot and a soft targethead of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of the game, no one can deny that they earned it, even though it is only for their hard work.
Rangers once again did not handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple roundabout.
Gerard acted at the break when he rolled Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the shift had an almost immediate impact when the wingman sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly of his strip chased to the block.
However, Livingstone continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgov and Halkett, who had infiltrated long - term dances.
Holt’s team could have increased their lead in the last stages, but McGregor got up well to stop Jacobs before Lithuania could reach the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penaltyhead when he met with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday" German: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and OUR TEL VERDER ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to track and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a support pillar of science, and it has also become a support pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950's "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans have played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to trace radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these sources, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Look, it's about time!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer agent can learn the immune system to 'see' wheel cells
New cancer component can teach the immune system to 'see' and die
Disposal Learns Immune System to Identify Wheel Cells as Part of Treatment
Method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory
They can then see a protein that's common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who was treated with the enzyme, who learned the immune system to identify thyroid cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can see a protein that appears in many cancers and is called HER2, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising ingredient."
HER2 "drives the growth of various types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, long- and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to remove immune cells from patients and "learn" them how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West began a pro-Trump spouting after his act on SNL, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was exposed during a Saturday Night Live at the workshop after a calculated action in which he believed US President Donald Trump and said he would be elected in 2020.
After he sang his third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great-Pet, he ran out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk so often to a white man and theirs, "How can you like Trump, he's a racer?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved from America long ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it has not been issued, the imagery of West’s dispute was loaded on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock the West by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that behind the elevation, he had difficulty wearing his head.
"They had me behind the high tower.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat on.'
They have my commandments!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
The West went, "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would wear his "supermandrel," because it means that you can't tell me what to do.
Try to love."
She commented at least twice on an appearance at the hearing, and members of the SNL roll division seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication, "The whole studio has become deadly."
West was introduced as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the space miner Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised by the performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who said, "To one of the bravest spirits: thank you that you are living up to the table."
But Mrs. Karen Hunter pointed out that West was just "who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose to reward someone NOT (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") that I believe accept an ideology and preach that endangers my society.
He's free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the spacecraft on Twitter announced that he changed his name and said that he now "is the beings that were known before Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
With spacecrafter, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, had a soft musical prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who had previously been known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticises toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his sword - drawn role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they should be talented to be respected.
Kit talked to The Sunday Times Culture and said he thought 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married with his fellow from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he 'reasonably strong' felt about doing this issue.
'I personally feel pretty strong about it at the moment--where did we go wrong with manhood?' he said.
'What did our men learn as they grew up about the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may be responsible for growth in toxic manhood because of its extremely male characteristics.
He went on, "What was born and what was taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that young boys feel they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
'Cause something apparently went wrong with our young men.'
in the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones' persecutions--and persecutions when the series next summer comes to an end, for he says he is 'clear with battlefields and horses'.
Since November Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought that the best thing that came from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so that it gave me my future family, and my life from here,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit’s character Jon Snow, in the emmy-cooked fantasy.
In June 2018, the couple married on the throne of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, its health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, representing a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have done HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Years later, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission by sex is a critical issue in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997 in China, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to work on the matter.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has released GOP senators' data, condemns 'dangerous lies' and 'cooperation theories'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters issued a statement on Saturday that a member of her staff placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were driven by "ultrarechts" experts and websites.
"Flying, lying, and still convulsive lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The detailed information claimed to include the home addresses and phone numbers for the US Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday on-line, posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate panel's hearing on the allegations of sexual misconduct against the appointed High Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the locations related to the Waters office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters staff reported the Hill.
"This unfounded claim is absolutely false and an absolute lie," the Waters went on.
"The member of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security were put at risk because of this deceptive and false claim -- was not at all responsible for the interpretation of this information.
This unfounded claim is absolutely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly provoked online criticism, including former Withuis-Pristor Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temper to be a member of the Congress.
When accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
It should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters ’ reaction to the Democrat’s criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of his criticism of being too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tries to light up water in the election from the kisses, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he whispered.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these misleading claims.
"We will make sure that the guards are put to the test," she went on, "and that they will be legally responsible for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - flower Rowan Atkinson spying
It is now traditional to search for Brexit sign in any new film with a British entry and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedyfranchise - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn further difficulties.
Will the tongue-in-the-choice self-satisfaction on the subject of how obvious power we are is the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the unhelpful Johnny English with his exhausting and rubber-faced face his license to make everything up for the second time renewed--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comical creation for non-English speaking film audiences.
He is, of course, the ridiculous secret agent who, in spite of his vicious claim to sophisticated elegance, a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good shot from that old who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire-Team at the openness of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He was also originally based on the traveler and international man of puzzles, who left chaos behind him, who Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard advertisements.
There are one or two pleasant moments in this latest version of JE.
I liked Johnny English who ran to a helicopter while he was dressed in a middle-aged jointscarf, and the screw blades cut short against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown, but the humor feels quite faint and peculiarly exaggerated, especially when the "strength" film trading brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible itself now use comedy with confidence as an ingredient.
The humor feels that it is fun to children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English’s adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silent film clips in the person of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Britain is in serious difficulty.
A copper cracker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, until the agent's distraught service -- a pitiful little roll for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a first minister who is a blushed and embellished character, who already experienced a total collapse of political inviolence: Emma Thomspson does her very best with this quasi-Teresa May character but there's only a little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is in danger, she should call someone out of her retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English itself, now serving as a teacher at some decent institution, but that from the record gives lessons about how to be a secret agent, there are some nice jokes here when English offers a School or Rock-Type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency order and is reunited with his former long-term companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an all-mapstic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is expected to be too little.
Thus, the Batman and Robin are once again serving fully in Her Majesty’s secret service and come down to Olga Curylenko’s beautiful wife fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister was under the dangerous assumption of the charismatic technology millennium that he claimed to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems — the ridiculous Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey from ridiculous escapades: pretended as cellars they put a French restaurant on fire, causing their chaos when they smack themselves on board of Volta's luxury oil; and English allows pure anarchy to break off when he tries to use a head for virtual reality to get familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene nothing is spared, but as pleasant and as exhausting as it may be, the whole affair is pretty much like child TV.
Fairly average.
And as with the other Johnny English roll pictures, I couldn't stop thinking: can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent his right?
Work refuses to consider a plan for Britta to work for a quarter of a week but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Workers' Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause Britta to be paid a four-week job -- but for five days.
Some people want to claim that company-based savings caused by the artificial intelligence (KI-) revolution should be transferred to workers by giving them their extra day off.
It will make workers enjoy a three-day week--but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say that at the party’s economic agenda and plans to put the country in the favor of the workers, it will “pass. ”
To change after a four-week period was written by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to exploit the changing economy.
A Senior Labour Partybroke told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to subscribe to such an idea, with the Green Party who promised a four-day work week during its campaign for the general election in 2017.
The ambition, however, is not currently being written by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Workers' Party said: 'A Thursday is not a party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to explore his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of 'unseen directors' and 'winners' from service companies.
The Minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire investment, since a Labour Government can make 'abductions' on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on company lines and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 per cent of equity in private sector companies, which can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy says "60 minutes" or the FBI's Kavanaugh survey can change them from opinion.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh had a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least a week late and raised the question whether the bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that Sunday was broadcast, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican sense. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could get anything that could change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and that accusation came out, and said, 'Have you done this?
He was determined, certainly, beyond doubt."
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be unchanging.
"I have formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamism," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett strongly denied it," Graham went on, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all those who call her could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the World Burger Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will be host to the World Burger Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that acts and has an equally impressive goal; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Burger Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival tens of thousands of people will stream to Central Park’s Great Law to enjoy not only actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the occasion to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Burger Festival, which began in 2012, is an expansion of the World War II project, an international negotiating group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free card for the occasion (unless you are willing to pay for a BBP card), concert participants had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way of raising awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But just how successful was a 12 - year - old World Burger who remained to achieve his goal?
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism" people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a twin?
Since 2011, Worldburger has reported that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which support a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are equivalent to over $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion was already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a U.K.-based company of investors and implementers connected to "helping children reach their full potential", and promise to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after they have received more than 4,700 World Citizens' Tweets.
"With the support of the U.K. government, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can leave the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history," said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman in April 2018 during a concert in London for the crowd.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions to bring the United Nations closer to improving nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with food seizures.
In response to one of the general questions on his website that asks, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Worldburger answered, "It will be a long and hard road--sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-aparity movements before us, we will be successful, because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is among the artists who will be offered this year's event in New York by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S.A. can use fleets for "blocked" to stop Russian energy exports - Minister of Home Affairs
"If necessary," Washington may leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from sinking into the market, including in the Middle East, the U.S.A.'s minister of domestic affairs, Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Sinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular where it works at the invitation of the legal government - is an obstacle to exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as generators for energy just as in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he claimed.
According to an official, there are ways and means to take them.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the seas are open, and, if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy is not on the market," he said.
Sinke addressed the residents of an opportunity offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit that views themselves as the "vote of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to handling Russia and Iran and noted that it is practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, less or more, to finance and replace fuel," he said while referring to Russia as a "one-teller" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The rulings come as Trump administration was on a mission to replace the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe to give Russia, at far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officials, including American President Donald Trump himself, tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" North Stream 2-pyplyn project, which, according to Trump Berlin, makes Moscow's "prisoned".
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2-pyplyn, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, said at a meeting with American Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view triggered a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said to a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider it carefully" to be president in 2020," the Senator of Massachusetts said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "consider it carefully" to stand as president after the mid-term elections.
During a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts confirmed Warren that she would consider it to stand.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and set up our dying government and it includes a woman in the highest sport," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider it seriously to stand for the President."
Warren had her opinion on President Donald Trump's air during the village meeting and he said "take the country in the wrong direction.
"I am up to my inner concern about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very critical of Trump and his appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
On a two-day Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A record released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own electors do not think it should stand in 2020.
Eight-and-five percent of "probably" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe recording.
Two-and-thirty percent supported the idea of standing.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent who supported the idea that he should stand up and against it.
Other high profile democratic names discussed to be possible in 2020 include former fishing president Joe Biden and Vermont’s Senator Bernie Sanders.
When he said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin named Track Palin's PTSV by Donald Trump party
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he joined in September
He was arrested on Monday morning and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son has gone through, which he has gone through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families that feel the consequences of PTSV and the injury with which our soldiers return," she told a audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they're coming back a little differently, they're coming back hard, they're coming back and wondering if there's respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and air fighters and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, mixed with complaints of domestic violence and possessed a gun while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and District Columbia support a legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that asylum refuses victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district have submitted a friend-of-the-court warrant to Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and to launch the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions proceedings submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August was not made public.
She says her mate "and her violent sons," abused her, but American officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The state prosecutors who supported Grace, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produced a large number of applicants for US asylum, described themselves as nations facing deep problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy in 2014 turned a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (Council of Immigrant Appeals) that allowed immigrants without the necessary documents fleeing from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia's Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy "deades ignores state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a lawyer violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-court-law order.
Prosecutors further stated in the legal order that the policies that deny immigrants access damage the US economy and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and will provide "necessary work."
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered in June immigration rights to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing from domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their country of birth because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his statement of policy on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems — even not all the serious problems — that people face every day throughout the world.
Hopeful rescue efforts in Palu while fatally doubled in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasing.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while she comforted her corrosive baby boy at a clearing-house in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute bring an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce."
Citizens were seen returning to their ruined homes, searching for drunken possessions, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-wide quake, were overwhelmed.
Of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu’s air - conditioned hospital where patients are treated outside because of constant severe shocks.
Trane fills his eyes as he tells of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth floor of the hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was impressed in the wall's puin, I think," Harris told the Associated Press and added that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accused China of 'abknoery' with 'propaganda-advertence'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper that praised the mutual benefits of U.S. China trade, the US ambassador for China Beijing accused the U.S. press of being used to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid inception in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa's newspaper with most sales – after he accused China of mixing a complaint with the US Congress elections of 6 November, which rejects China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tries to interfere in the U.S. elections, marked what US officials told Reuters, a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington is to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a escalating trade war that has led to their tariffs becoming equal to each other's imports.
China’s early payroll in the trade war aimed at striking exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing injured US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstadt wrote in an opinion poll in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now exacerbates the anger by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seized America's curious tradition of free speech and on a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, a person at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing will find very limited diverging voices and not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic trajectory, giving that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers was afraid of the offer to publish his article," although he did not say what newspaper.
Republics Removed Women's Voters for Elections with Kavanaugh Debakel, Warning Analysts
While many top republics at the Supreme Court-named Brett Kavanaugh stand and defend him in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that during the coming elections they would see a reaction, especially of women.
The emotions are so high, and most republics are remembering that they already indicate that they want to go ahead with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reecher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s commission for an FBI investigation on the nipperkit would be enough to track bad voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday--they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, soldiers "November is on the way!" fainted as they marched into the entrance gate of the Senate while the Republics who had elected the Judicial Committee to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the novelty.
"People say it was already high; it is true.
But it can be higher, especially among swan-woman voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which illustrates the details of her assault on the Supreme Court-designated sexual assault, analysts said a reaction can follow if Republics continue to confirm.
"It had become a nightmare for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote and that Kavanaugh is sitting on the court, it's also about how the Republics handled it and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, pointed out to the news channel a group that helps to choose Democrats.
But Americans seem somewhat divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with slightly more than the latter’s choice.
A new recording of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are sure or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they definitely believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh had probably been watching during his witnessing, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s suggestion, the FBI is currently examining the claims made by Ford, as well as at least one claim, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate's Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-genomeinated his family members exposed her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web is planning to start a new Internet to tell Google and Facebook the battle
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, leads a start-up attempt to deal with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology-legging project, Inrupt, is a company that built on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee argued that the idea of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "Personal Online Data Storage" or a POD.
This may include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique to the personal online data storage is that it is entirely from the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and relevant skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers of the personnel contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about the announcement of an overall change, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a location on the medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he established the World Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he leads Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the World Web consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm great optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Water: WW1 Victoriakrush-spiritual celebration
The only clergy of the Church of England who won the Victorian Crusade as a fighter during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt.Kol vr. Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sharp shooter and never knew that he had earned the highest British military honor.
A monument was discovered on Saturday by his two little boys at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his little boys, Michael Vann, said it was "brilling symbols" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's crowned performance.
According to the London Gazette, lt.Kol. On September 29, 1918, Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very dense mist and under heavy fire from the fields and machines."
He then hurried to the fire line and with the "greatest bravery" led the line forward before he had only destroyed a man-only field gun and blew three of the department.
Lt.Kol Vann was killed by a German sharp shot on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action is "something I know I can never stand, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a crown to the parades, led by the Brentwood Imperial Jugorkes.
Michael Vann said he "felt hurt to be able to play a role in the parades" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by a crowd of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Picture yourself, you stay awake all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, just not to be able to watch the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 matches, including six on the main program that would be broadcast directly at night in the United States on Channel 5.
About 6 a.m., just when Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the battle, viewers in the United States were left speechless when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after keeping awake to the battle until early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the transition to the children's picture as "some sick joke."
"It's a government regulation that the content at 6 nm was not suitable and therefore they had to switch to child programs," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Fish President of Marketing and Communication, when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to include future U.K. viewers.
"I think that when I think of the broadcast, I think we can probably do something," said the Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we'll be unable to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it changed, there were many text messages sent over and over and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that it will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six – as we normally do – and we have tried to offer more to our adherents and just went about our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'degradable' about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't go to high school before he realized that "not everyone like me is."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he had a sense of gay rights to give other "hop".
He also said that to become a parent, he was less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular provider of the year-long program, Kirsty Young, has been retired for a few months because of illness.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings are less than, and otherwise feel, the real things that have given me the power and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a high profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's State Union Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he smiled because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and to give other "hope".
The three-time world champion said that to fall in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "he caught on the edge."
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been a question.
"When you get through so much at such a young age," he went to his first Olympic Games at 14 years of age and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar height and low points.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything went about 'I must win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son died the same name as his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says that his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked for or had all the cards for London 2012 — because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not involuntary," he said.
The following year, Daley won the 2012 Olympic Games.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of my life for a long time--to dive before my homeboard at an Olympic game, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection — Proud by Heather Small — who also resonated with him in the construction of the Olympic Games and still gives him chicken meat.
Desert Island Disks is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson does not drive and withdraw to Saturday’s Ryderbeker
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder victory, but he will have to take his form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record-12th time in the two-year event, was taken to the game by Captain Jim Fury for Saturday's four-ball games and quarters.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will divide his day by being a race leader and on the train station at his game work in the hope of setting up a scaffolding.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the most upright driver, and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National-bahan where the long robbery always punishs the heavy traps.
And as if the job on his own wasn't challenging enough, Mickelson Sunday came to stand in his ninth match against the exact British Ope champion Francesco Molinari, who had joined up with the new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four - point - after, the 12 single - game competitions, can begin well, Mikkelson’s match can be absolutely necessary.
Fury expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much different.
"He had his role as he had fully understood today, gave me a kick on my back and his arm sat around me and said he would be right tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has much confidence in himself.
He is in the Heldesaal, and he has contributed so much in the past and this week to these tensions.
I probably didn’t think he would play two games.
I put more in perspective, but that is how things worked out and that is what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the job, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will exceed Sunday Nick Fallo’s record for the player who played most of the riders’ contests.
This can mark the end of a Ryderbek race that never really matched the highlights of its individual performances.
Mickelson had 18 wings, 20 lowers, and seven halfs, although Fury said that his presence had contributed countless aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, caught, likes to tear the crazy, and he's a wonderful old man to have in the room," he explained.
"I think the younger players enjoyed it too to mess with him, which was fun to watch.
He offers so much more than just games."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows great progress can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advance before the last day’s single game in the Ryderbeker can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dean made his debut in the 1997 competition at Valderrama, where the team under the leadership of Seven Ballesteros, had a five-point lead, but won only needle scrap with 141⁄2-131.2.
"A man continues to remind himself that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won the nail tie," Bjorn said, on the photo, after watching how the 2018 class won 5-3 and yesterday was 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that it is not over.
You're gonna be all right tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I still say, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Rejoice over how his players were in danger on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never go ahead with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes in turn, and it's a horse of another color.
It's wonderful to be out there with a mate when things go well, but when you're individually there, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you must deliver to players, best of your own tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his nephew Jim Fury would want his players to walk better individually than they did as players, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Fury himself had been surrounded on both sides of that great last day, where he was part of the wish team at Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe achieved the "wonder of Medina".
"I remember every covert word of it," he said in response when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999 spoke boldly to his players on the way to that last day.
"We had 12 important games tomorrow, but a man would like to start well, as seen by Brookline, as seen by Medina.
When that moment starts in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle competitions.
We set up our team accordingly, and divided the men who felt us, you know, will bring us some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the attack and is in the main struggle against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who is the other Europeans in the upper half of the division.
"I chose this group of boys in this order, because I think it covers it to the end," Bjorn said about his single game choices.
Germany’s new warship is being postponed
In 2014, the German army’s latest coup would have served to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reports.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Time newspaper quoted by a military spokesman.
This vessel had to join the fleet in 2014, but the grieving postal delivery issues tested this ambitious project’s fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a slag air and anti-shipship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to develop the latest frugts for up to two years away from the doorways.
However, constant delays mean that the advanced warships — apparently enabling Germany to design power overseas — will already be old - fashioned by the time they enter the service, called The Time.
The disastrous F125 frigate made a record last year when the German fleet officially refused to serve the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the fleet has sent back a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if it is developed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be handled by a crew of about 120 mattresses – only half of the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.
It also revealed that the ship was heavily overweight, reducing the work performance and reducing the fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" are probably twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the award label for the entire project – including the training of the crew – also became a question.
It has apparently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the original €2.2 billion.
The problems posed by the new frigates are especially important in the light of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is on the move.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet's "ships that can be deployed are being hit."
The officer said that the issue had worsened over time, for old ships were put out of service, but no replacements were provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the fleet.
National Trust Listens to Museums ’ Secret Life
New research is being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual and soprano bat as well as the brown long and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on the property at important locations to track fireworks throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also make mobile recordings by using hand-guides.
Expert-clients of all recordings will check the frequency of the bats and determine which species they are doing.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS hope the results will reveal what areas of habitat are most important for the feathers and how it is used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as wildlife creation and how to best manage forests for bats and other associated species.
Flemish populations in Scotland and throughout the United States have fallen significantly during the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleep and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as can fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Flying flies are not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-orientation technique to display gogs and obstacles on their flight sizes.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly take up and carry out sleep inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even set up Scotland’s first and only dedicated museum reserve at Thrave Land Goods in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Landowner David Thompson says the land is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that are still unknown, so the work that we do here and on other properties helps us to better understand what they need to flourish."
He stresses the need to search for bats before maintenance is done in property because it is possible that unconscious destruction of a single shell can mean death of up to 400 women and children and can destroy a whole local population.
Flying mice are protected and it is illegal to kill, control, or prevent or destroy their sleeping quarters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations go."
Ronaldo dismisses rape claims while prosecutors prepare for German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo filed rape allegations against him as "false news" and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His prosecutors are ready to observe German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus predictor was accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375 000 to remain silent over the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he spoke to his 142 million followers, hours to the claims, Ronaldo, 33, finished the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything is right," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s prosecutor is preparing to read Der Spiegel’s claim, which they called, according to Reuters, “inadmissible reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy”.
Prosecutor Christian Schertz said the player will claim compensation for "moral compensation for any amount corresponding to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga claimed to have gone to the player's room, where he believed she had raped anal, according to documents submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo had fallen to the alleged incident on his knees and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" left in the trap by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a trial outside the court because she was "feared for reprisal" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she wants to reverse the skill now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged attack on the point of joining from Manchester United at Real Madrid and moved this summer, in a €100 million match to the Italian giant, Juve.
Brexit: UK will 'repent forever' if their engine manufacturers lose
The UK 'will regret it forever' if they lose their status as world leader in motor production to Brexit, said Enterprise Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is "comfortative" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a non-correspondence-Brexit may cost mail.
Last year, the Burnaston plant - produced by Toyota’s Auris and Aveniss - produced nearly 150 000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, toyota's executive director at Burnaston.
Other U.K. motor manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, were afraid to leave the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade would work.
BMW, for example, said that they would close their mini project in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what motor manufacturers say feed chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "net time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be distortions on the border that the company says can lead to delays and cuts in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to maintain more than one day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU was "accalibrated precisely to avoid those border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow us not only to enjoy the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what a very successful set of supply chains were."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned that added costs in the long term could reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost mail.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and the United Union's collaborator on the project, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back.
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Tromp encounter with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says Withuis
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with adjunct prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can "be postponed for another week" while the fighting over the genocide for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Legal Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian election mix, links between Trump-helpers and Russia, and possible cross-broadcasting of the law by the president.
Whether Trump is going to thank the adjunct prosecutor general or not, and thereby threatening Mueller's independence, Washington's gossip stories have been fueled for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of bringing up a recorder to talk to Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to thank.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to thank" for Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate-regbank's hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump further postponed a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for it has not yet been determined; it may be this week, I can see that it is postponed for another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like keeping the press up."
Some journalists will differ with that statement: Sanders has not been holding a White House press session since 10 September.
Hoster Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortness of information sessions is not because of a contradiction to TV journalists who are "effect-fighting," although she said, "I will not argue with their effect-fighting."
She then indicated that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without bringing evidence, "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then it is infinitely better than to talk to me.
We've been trying to do it a lot, and you've seen it a lot over the last few weeks, and it's going to take the place of a press session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press statements with visiting dignitaries.
Solo-performing is rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and timeless appearance to journalists gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit-free
The Secretary of Health told EU personnel who wrote in Scotland’s NHS to show the country’s gratitude and express the wish that they would stay after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months before the UK withdrawing from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering costs of completed status requests for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU continued on withdrawal, on the way to the expected decisions of these autumns.
But the U.K. government also reinforced their preparations for a possible non-conformity scenario.
I know it's a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat how much I pay each staff member’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and that benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' line player Christian Abercrombie had an emergency after he suffered a major injury on Saturday 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee-span's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State chief Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the breakup.
"He came to the corner and kind of just in there," said Reed.
Drivers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline before he was placed on a portable and was taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/range of the injury" and that Tennessee still tries to locate when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
He killed Saturday five times before leaving the game, bringing his total season to 18 deaths.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when they buy an property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbin's effort to draw young voters
The stamp tax will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Thessourie expects to collect up to £120 million a year — to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when they buy an property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an effort to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to target high-customers.
The stamp tax increase will be lifted on individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the United States, with the extra money that the government’s plans will help to combat unemployment.
The added tax — which is outside the current seal tax, including the higher levels set two years ago on second houses and houses purchased for rent — may be as much as three percent.
The Thessourie expects that the movement can bring up to £120 million a year.
A estimated 13 percent of new London property is purchased by non-VK citizens who boost the price and make it more difficult for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "spook villages" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in stamp tax to help more young people to own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping their property prices high by picking up land, but not using it, and encouraged Ms. May to take a stand against bribes on affordable houses to restore Britain's "dwelling ramp".
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of proposed house improvements, including rental management and an end to "no-error releases".
He also wants to give advice greater power to build new homes.
Ms. May said, "Last year I said I will dedicate my first ministry to restoring the British dream – that life must be better for every new generation.
And it means restoring our fragmented home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life.
But it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the United States as foreign - based companies to buy homes as it is for hard - working British residents.
For too many people the dream of homelessness has become a dream from afar, and the humiliation of vanity is too great a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland-led Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the driver of Scotland at some point.
The Scott, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing up new life in the North-East, which is now third in the Liga One, three points below the tops.
He moved this summer to the Stadium of Light after returning last season St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got the second team, but it was already," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I often looked as a child with my father for Scotland at Hampden and it was something that drew me back.
However, the opportunity can only come if I succeed with club management."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic-bass said he felt no fear of imitating such established names at such a large club, after he had previously shown presentations of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me will be measured by ''can I bring this club back to the Prime Minister's league?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it certainly belongs to the Premier ligature," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross’s career in the management is only three years away, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts’ staff.
He then helped Alloa return from religion to the third league and convert St. Mirren from on the edge of religion to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroad," he said when he thought back to how he took Alloa's smiles.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds silly, because I did well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and lived reasonably high points.
But the game can be difficult.
There's a lot of things you need to come up with on a weekly basis.
I keep going through the stress and pressure of the work, but management feels just right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable I've been in my own skin all my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 nm on a Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s incomes, but it put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and groups saw sales in July with a 2.7% increase – but receiving in restaurants was 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of the business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Sunninged sun and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a similar pattern than last month, June, when drinks were up by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only increased in July.
Drinking-led drinking places and herbs have done much better at far and increased more than what restaurants have fallen.
Food-leaded drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not so much as restaurant operators
It looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
All over managed cows and drinking places, sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, with food cut off by three percent."
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analyst RSM, said: "These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
Again and the impact of large social or sports events remains the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-the-home-out market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly difficult above and besides constant cost pressure.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and only the time would show if the more moderate temperatures that we have experienced since August would bring the necessary relief."

One of five children has secret social media accounts that they hide for their parents
One of five children – some as young as 11 – has secret social media accounts that they hide for their parents and teachers, revealing a recording
Recording of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "bad Insta-bladsye"
The news raised fears that sexual content should be placed
Twenty percent of students say they have a "headoff" to show for parents
One of five children — some as young as 11 — creates social media accounts that keep them secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "bad Insta accounts" – a reference to the Instagram photo department.
The news raised fears that sexual content would be placed.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "headoff" to show parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who came down on her 13-year-old daughter's secret rent found a teenager who encouraged others to "roose her."
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them recognizing that they have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't trace them."
Eleid Doyle will be "vote for athletes" on Scottish Athletic Council
Elid Doyle was elected to the council of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the management body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated job and field guide and President Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilid has great respect for the Scottish, the UK and the world's athletic community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit much from what she brings to the advice," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes I and hope I can really contribute and help drive the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has the 200 meters and 400 meters at 1996 games in Atlanta under his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, unable to run after having a short - term ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn’t walk.
Doctors said that only time would teach me whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it fully recovered, again learned how to walk and do chores today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Waste pump version comparing mothers to cows sharing opinions online
A stock company has divided opinions online with an advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
To celebrate the launch of what is called the "first world's quiet portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-choice music video-inspiring ad to show the freedom that the pump gives to mothers who milk out.
Four straight mothers dance in a bowl full of straw and cows at the size of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a beginner" and "In case you haven't seen it, it's not eggs, it's my breasts."
The body parts say, "Spring it out, pump it out, I run the baby out, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a mixed response from viewers, with many who say it represents the "growels" of the silk industry.
"Very weak decision to use cows to advertise this product.
If we have to become pregnant and give birth to be able to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.

Another observed: "Explainably traumas for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can't keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The ad is so out of touch."
Others defended the ad, with one woman who admitted that the song was for her "screams."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I still had a baby.
To get milk made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little bit of a time, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another observed: "This is a nice ad directed at mothers who often feel exhausted (in their workplaces or toilets) and like "cows".
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the silk industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign was based on the insight that many women who hatch say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is deadly, has no strings or tubes and just discreetly in a food bridge that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a large and outstanding announcement.
By drawing a parallel between women who milk and milk cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges into the throat, while we were in a pleasant way in which people could find connection the wonderful feeling of freedom that would bring the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has picked up the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the run for designer Martha Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrants still move to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply although monthly border bodies have remained relatively unchanged, partly because of various rhetorics and policies imposed by the Trump administration that make it more difficult to place children in debt.
Traditionally, most bourgeoises were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be endangered by moving forward to demand a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential citizens and other adult members of their households should be given their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer at Immigration and the Congress, testified that the agency had arrested thousands of people who applied to protect unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are citizens or family members of citizens are illegal here in the country and a large crowd of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to process the children more quickly, officials set new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month after detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to protective workers.
Many will appear through videoconferencing, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status at an immigration right.
Those who are considered unfit for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more likely it is that they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent explosions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say those concerns are raised at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child's difficulty is more easily missed because of the size.
They added that to move the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare to tell their friends, the trauma can worsen that is already very difficult.
Syria tells the US, French and Turkish 'powers of occupation' to withdraw immediately
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in his eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign powers are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism and will be "handled accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, with millions who have been displaced, is "amply past."
He said Damascus will continue "to carry on this sacred battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has trained and advised some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "unreasonable fears which encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returnees," he said.
"They're policing something that just needs to be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebellion of Idlib, created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement rejected a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear sparrows" and expressed the hope that military actions would target jihadists, including soldiers of the Al-Qaeda-connected Nusra Front who would be "cut off".
UN-gentle, Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said that the panel's work should be limited to the "enactment of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump would win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the election in 2020, unless, as much liberal hope is likely, a state of charge and scandal will soon end his presidency.
In which no doubt "the most dramatic finals of a presidency will ever be!"
To date, there are no signs of sighting fatigue.
Since 2014, peaks have doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is above cable screens with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news.
"It's a fire that people are attracted to, because it's not something we understand," says Neal Baer, programme manager of the ABC drama "Designed Survivors" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi driver in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he has made me laugh,' said I. Scovell to me.
There are entertainment values in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on the TV, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families, and the health of the world economy.
To switch off is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
And yet it goes further than being just an informed citizen when you are in the sixth hour to watch a panel of experts debate on Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 volleyball-air bath ("a piece of clothes thick from the hubris", The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he carries you something every night," says Brent Montgomery, head of the business of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's changing role-sharing and daily ties in the plot (such as seeking to win a fight with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you stay behind.
When I arrived this week for Mr. Fleiss, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside looking at MSNBC while taking CNN.
He could not cut him off, nor was he on his way with Brett Kavanaugh to appear before the Senate’s government and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the scales.
"I remember when we did all that time program and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems they were right now."

Extra cash flows to the most exciting mid-term selection race in home
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th century saw an inflow of money, thanks to a movement of congress districts that have now two officers in a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburgh district allows Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – to measure forces.
Lamb stands against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily overwhelmed with the new 17th.
The cards were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January determined that the old districts were unlawfully grounded in the Republic’s favor.
The race in the new 17th ended with a field finance competition between the major parties’ financial legs, the Democratic Field Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republical Field Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well - known name in Pennsylvania after a nailed victory in a wide - eyed special election in March for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congress district.
The seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats an emotional advantage.
U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador rather than supporting China, but then returned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the company expelled the Trump Organization’s board of directors.
Officials of the state departments decided to call back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador that received a estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug management, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder figures.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level convention and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar convention last year considered a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the congress to continue to effectively end any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Adjunct president Mike Pence was now determined to speak to the congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the assembly for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American sentinels returned in style to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new bad messages or harshness from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consultation on terms of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study history
The next thing that may happen can be the special discussion of Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible circumvention of the trial, of which there is now a very significant witness in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's focus was probably also investigating whether Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia worked in the country's attack on our elections.
If the Congress were to pass in other hands, Mr. Trump's responsibility would have to stand in the face of that body, just as he was preparing to go back to the electorate, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peer group.
It's a bunch of aces, and so I don't want to let you know that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – and not those of his squadrons in Europe.
There are decisions to be taken on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be resolved.
In 1938 German officials were ready to execute a coup against Hitler, if the West only opposed him and supported the Czech-Slovak at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the slaughter of the years that followed.
The course of history is speeding up or slowing down such turning points and democracy.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump Adjunct Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation, resigns?
Rosenstein had been in hot water since this newspaper reported that he proposed last year to take up the president secretly and speculated about whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the election for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump responsible?
If we do those tests, there's a long winter ahead of democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my embassy house.
She survived, migrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to build Sabbath churches on that table carrying the washing machine.
With it as my origin, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans Optimistics for Rapid Vienna Fight
Rangers play Thursday guests for Rapid Vienna knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive match-off in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented middle-field player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2-like explosion against Villareal, but he believes Rangers can use this output as a starting point for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villareal is a good team," said the 31st.
"We went into the competition with the conviction that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it at the end, but a match count is probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday is another great European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a hard game, because they had a good outcome in their last match, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can get through and get a positive outcome.
Last year was certainly hard, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but now there's a well-being factor in place.
The group is good, and the men enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can now press through, last season behind us sit and be successful."
Women Lost Sleeping Over These Fears of Deception
Despite the fact that participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk about it to their relatives.
About half of the individuals in the Nationalwide study said they were talking to their own notes about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, Fish President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not express your wishes long before the time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as those choices can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Introduce your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come forward with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term funding decisions can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-life insurance policy to help cover these expenditures or self-insurance with your own resources – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut legal disputes at the passport.
Get a health care authority in place so you show a trusted individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that experts meet your wishes if you can't communicate.
Consider also perfection for your finances.
You must choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are not authorized.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play those details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are in question, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medicine?
Who will provide for the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Several times you shot in Ilfracombe with windbucks
A man was shot several times with a windbuck when he walked home after a night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred against about 02:30 BST, as a "possible action".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life - threatening, and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officials said, and the mortality is expected to rise.
With communications put out of action, relief officers could not get any information from Dongala Regent, an area north of Palu that is close to the center of the 7.5-wide collision.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster.
Here are a few key events about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central-Sulawesi province, located at the point of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck them.
Dodgala is a regency that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regent, an administrative region under a province, had a estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the support pillars of the Central-Sulawesi province’s economy, especially the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowoli, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times over the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit West Dongala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the Seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: A major quake along the western coast of the Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 which led to a tsunami that hit 14 countries, led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong clashes left the western coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The south of Java, Indonesia was hit by the most populous island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-wide quake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the West-Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-wide quake hit one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, leading to a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozen villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A level of shaking hit the Pidie Jaya Regent in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly quake and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead this time to a tsunami, but more than 100 is dead because of buildings that fell down,
2018: Great shocks hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son is arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and fish presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he dropped a woman’s phone when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pre-trial Facility and is maintained on a $500 unsecured guarantee, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, certainly" when asked what he complained about, the network reported.
Palin looks at three classes of A violations in the face, which means he can be locked up for up to a year and fined $250 000.
He is also charged with a class B violation, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2 000.
This is not the first time that criminal complaints against Palin have been filed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is now in front of Alaska’s Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, involved in the report of a crime of domestic violence, and owned a firearm while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterinary groups after she linked her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of her duty in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-wide earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been put out of action with deaths expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit only outside central Sulavesi, which is northeastern of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death sentence for suspects in NYC earthquake
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City earthquake that has caused eight people's death – a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental engine to launch an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side highway in Laer Manhattan to destroy pedestrians and a bike driver who was on his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov " purposefully" killed the eight victims and " purposefully" suffered serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intention to ask for the death penalty, presented in the South District of New York.
Both of those charges bring possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal major jury struck Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder in favour of repression, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "deep planning and preconceivedness", the prosecutors said and described the way Saipov carried it out as "violent, cruel and perverse".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," said the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the South District of New York was prosecuted by a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the death of two drug victims, but eventually in September 2009 he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after they were sentenced to a conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviets during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were arrested with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Ziphov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He mentioned to investigators that he felt good about what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He was innocent of the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro-Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said that they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than to accept a guilt confession to life imprisonment with no possible release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved." Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in control of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the people's power" today during a protest at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to feel the "hot feeling" of Eurosceptic – as one of Theresa May's own LPs proposed he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone told March in Birmingham that the UK by the time Mr. Farage Brexit was "soo out" was secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces to unite her deep-separate officers by calling pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime challenge is to maintain its Chequers compromise plan in the midst of attacks by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Bonds insisted that she would press the door in her attempt to agree with Brussels in spite of the death march – and Eurosceptic and Labour forced her to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said for the Loop Mark Loop convention in Solihul that he wanted to remove "Chequers".
He proposed that Mr Farage should have been made an excellent man and be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were in control, we would have been out by the time,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added: 'I'll get up for Brexit, but we have to throw out Cheques.'
He stated his opposition to the EU and said: "We did not fight world wars to be subject.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone suggested that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their mind and wish to be completely disappointed.’
Tory Brexitier Andrea Jenkyns was also in March and told reporters: ‘ I simply say: First Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually bomb the streets and make sure that we are selected in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Ms. May, she added: ‘First ministers must keep their work when they keep their promises.’
Mr. Farge told us that the convention politicians had to feel the "hot" if they were on the threshold to break the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'It's about a matter of confidence between us--the people--and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you go with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We mobilize the people's power of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour convention in the middle of the city.
A few activists have fought Tories against Brexit banners to announce the group this weekend.
Worker Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application like the conference opened.
'It's the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus in place, for the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It's a complete trick.
There is not such a thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to 'look hard' to stand for the president
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she will "look hard to stand for the president" to the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts-Democrat talked about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, stands for a re-election in November against GOP, Rep Geoff Diehl, co-chaired by Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the midst of speculation that her Trump may be facing a challenge in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump was under way.
A member asked her if she was planning to stand for the president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to correct our broken government, and it closes up in a very top woman."
Arrested in the shooting of LSU’s Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA., announced Saturday that a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET-New Conference.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying a man seen in the image material.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University.
"Wayde Sims had a gunshot wound in his head and was finally killed as a result of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media by 247 sports Saturday.
Wayde entered to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, owned a gun, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 leading last season and held an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumpballs per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton highlights world title after team commands gave him his victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment that Valteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes' team commands would play a major role in the races.
From a pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the wells, and Hamilton left behind much to ride into the van in traffic, something that had to be decisive.
The Mercedes dropped a round later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-to-wheel action that the Ferrari driver counter-free the inside saw left at risk of detachment to a double-move to defend on the third corner.
Max Disappearen began from the back row of the road route and was seventh toward the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led to a large part of the revolutions as he held on to his bands to quickly finish and to hide Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He could have entered the wells on the 44th round, but his pace could not have accelerated in the remaining eight rounds, since Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valteri did amazingly weekends and was a real gentleman.
The team did outstanding work to have one-two," said Hamilton.
It was a real bad lifting language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a convention on her attack that she did not deliver Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused the Supreme Court of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the testimony Ford gave before the Senate's Committee. Instead, he commented that what was said in the Senate showed that people were "common and unscrupulous and liars".
"The one thing that may happen and the lovely thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and common and lying," he said.
"When you look at explanations and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Where?
Diane Feinstein, did you lick?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document--oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we lick it... no, we didn't lick it," he added, in a preface of the senator.
Feinstein was sent back in July to Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was earlier in September — but Feinstein denied that the leak from her office had arrived.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not respect her denial and commented during the Saturday evening convention: "I tell you what.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst lifting language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court-deminized accused of sexual misconduct by three women and suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back any necessary means.
You see the community, the injustice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to care for to get power and control," media told the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two targets for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled Friday’s Elite League’s loss against Belfast Giants by winning the match 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants got an early two-way lead by throwing from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team together before Dwyer restored the Giants ’ leadership.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee up before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen targets established their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who had lost first battles and when Friday night, Dundee won 2-1 in Belfast.
This was the fourth convention of the season between the sides, with the Giants who won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaul-help, with David Rutherford who provided the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back to play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer surely made the Giants take the lead in the first break when he threw his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again got their match with a force target at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran stood together to help Nielsen to give Dundee the lead for the first time in the contest in the second half and he made sure of the win with his team’s fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who now lost four of their last five matches are home to Milton Keynes in their next match Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of aircraft can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is regarded as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people rose safely.
More than 800 people are dead and more are missing after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong shells in the area, and many have been trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But in spite of his colleagues who fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agg refused to leave his post in the control tower, which swung heavily on the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained unmoved to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the run, was able to rise safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he daydreamed it together.
Later he died in the hospital.
Dictionary for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts broke to hear of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the fatality can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster prevention agency, which says that access to the villages of Dongala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the mortality rate is still increasing as many bodies are still under construction while many still cannot be reached," said agent spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that reached six feet [6 m] in length touched Palu, which would hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute bring in an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarks are plowed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Rooikruis in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Rooikruis hunts to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military service: "I ask you to work day and night to complete each task related to disposal.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia aircraft accident: Air Niugini says now one man is missing after a beach plane accident
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they had previously said that all 47 passengers and crew safely cleared the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said that they work with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while it tried to land at the Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane had landed near the runway in the beach.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to walk through the middle of the water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the air conditioners panicked and screamed and that he had caused a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that creatures who worked close to the improvement of a key also helped with a blowable boat with the rescue to get people to land before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered aircraft in the past two decades, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analyst sets the timeline of the night that woman is burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used phone records to gather the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night he died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from different phones that showed that Tellis and Chambers were together on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's dress that night, Sanford said, "Look, because my dress was in Nashville."
There's only one inconsistency that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when he was dead.
Cellphone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers deleted messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He's had her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense was scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative look of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origin of political messages and the handling of social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common saw a recent reconstruction in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
That's a black person?
NEW child woman lives in a couple because she has been denied the "racist" text
A New York Child's wife went to a party for discriminatory resignation after she received a wrong address message from the mother who complained that she was "a pretty black person."
The couple deny that they're racist and compare the thing to "impression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, voiced her dismay when she learned that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NOEEEEEEEEEA NON A black person," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to me twice.
After she found out her mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman thanked Maurice and said that their outgoing baby nurse who was African-American did bad work and that she had rather expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
I Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent to a Uber house.
Now Maurice sells the couple for damages over the deduction and seeks his compensation to the amount of $350 per day for the six months, resident work for which she was originally appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such good," she told the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the claims that they were racists and said that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice’s submission and fear that they would not be able to trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a race.
We are not racist people," said the man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you sit your children in the hands of someone you were rude to, even though it had been by the way?
Your first father?
Come on."
Plasco compared the matter to "suffering" and said that his wife would have a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going after such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment bankier added.
As the case continues, the court of public opinion was quick to bring the couple to social media and to beat them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter revealed that Paddington publishers feared that a conversational bear would not involve readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's very pleasant that we know of Paddington's great success."
She said her father would have been hot when his work was rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book on the little toys. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release after his death was "bitter-sweet."
About Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an orange man," she said.
"But because Paddington was really for him, it was almost as if man had a child who had achieved something: you are proud of them, even though it is not your job.
I think he saw Paddington’s success in that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor of Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hello to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2-hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad has regularly called to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to do it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I received the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I had to greet her.
And I do.
I said, "Tashi, I'm very fond of you, heartlam.
I will soon be with you.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slow to get up and leave her system.
She was a while before she died, and the body was shutting down.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was spread.
I couldn't cry or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who had been hurt by the loss of her daughter at the time, accompanied the other passengers on board the plane - unaware of the trial she had been appreciating.
"No one knew," she said.
"I shook my head and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelming sympathy for Nad on the flight.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women post cards to prevent suicides in need
Two women who lost loved ones for suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey's mail cards have been on a Welsh bridge for a while with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself on the 18th.
"I want no parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45, lived in Lydney and said that her son was a promising boss with an offensive smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that she smiled at any room."
But he gave up work before he was dead, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11, found his brother after he took his own life.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there who you can go to and who you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit down quietly - you need to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas--when the children opened their presents, he did not contact them or do anything with them."
She said her death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "This time a hole through the family.
This hurts us.
But we all have to go and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future has yet to be investigated by the FBI
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked--a timeless investigation that didn't have a stroke--maybe we could bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was going to "fall apart" under the narrowest split-up.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to set up the FBI investigation?
Their opposition is all due to timing.
The elections are only weeks away, on November 6, if, as is expected, the Republics go bad, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to go to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House, who met his wife Ashley through him and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI issues its report?
There will be a voice in the Senate, where 51 Republics and 49 Democrats are sitting today.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor which will allow Mike Pence, the president of the fish, to break a record and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea running numbers 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean warriors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Young-one seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-sought quoted data from the South's unique cabinet and said that last year there were 1,127 rounds - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said more stringent border control between North Korea and China and higher tariffs requested by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
Finally, the vast majority of runners from the North are offered South Korea citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flights through Shina, which has the longest border with North Korea, are easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreans.
She views the fugitives as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, often repatriating them with violence.
Relationships between the North and the South, which continue to speak techniques in war with one another, have greatly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks that focused around the stagnant negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress ever since.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Meeting in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histories," says he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
Home Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court-designated Brett Kavanaugh "histories" and said that he was temporarily incapable of serving at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi delivered the comment in a interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not help thinking that if a woman had ever acted like this, they would say 'histories'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate judicial committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost screamed and sneeze while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly rejected Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him "a ridiculous and coordinated murder of character", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony had proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think he does not fit in with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was shocked when she was asked if she would try to appeal to Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats win the majority in the Laerhaus.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not competent to be at the Supreme Court, but to be at the court where he is now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Omengang Appealhof.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on Attractable Care of Roe v. Wade as he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh wondered whether he would overrule certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women have to handle it.
It is a righteous diarib, months, and years' anger that boils over, and she can't get it without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, whoever said that she cried when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and began to cry, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Trans are allowed as a partial output for atoms because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office is where I once found that I cried with nameless anger and was caught by my nephew by an older woman--a cold driver for whom I was a little afraid--who dragged me into a t-report.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are grieved, and will rejoice, because they have had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was replaced in an external relationship called Monkey Business and he had to leave the revolutions, Shreeder, very frustrated me, realized that there was no reason she could not investigate the idea that she could run for the president.
"I didn't think well of the decision," she said to me some 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the competitions and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with founding collections and so she made a vow that she would not enter the revolution unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, she would only give $250.
"Do they think I get fired?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not lead a formal campaign, she was overcome by emotion--thanks to the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so hard to collect money and to target voters rather than delegates, and angry for sexism--that she had a gesture.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder called me about how the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleinex was my corporate guarantee.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
How the US China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening alvos of the trade war between the US and Shina were overwhelming and while the battle is over, a disagreement between the countries may be beneficial in the long-term for Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, first warned earlier this year by imposing important Chinese executions, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week’s most interesting escalation has an ingerol with new tariffs that affect $200 billion (£150 billion) items and effectively charge half of the goods coming into the US of China.
Beijing took a good reprehensible turn every time, and the recent rate of five to ten percent on $60 billion’s American goods hit.
Shina promised to equalize the US shooter-by-shoot and the world's largest economy is not going to move soon.
To get Washington back means to surrender to requests, but to meet in public the US' requests will be too much of a disgrace to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure on US trade war over the long-term China can support positively by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that can start an economic twelve-year-old in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than viewers had previously known," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria 'prepared' for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and calls for help to rebuild the land that has been destroyed by war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country improve.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be left because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that had taken their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian people have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the plains.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that protected the attack.
Europe honours Ryder beaker victory in Paris
Span Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and Span U.S.A. with a final point from 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a rider cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn picked up the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
US-star Phil Mickelson, who had failed most of the tournament, had his T-hold in the water at the par-3 16th gate plunging and awarded his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been blind in all its rounds and has become one of the 1-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world’s highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder beakers, Spanjaard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's European winner of all times with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia to the European victory.
He hands over the fact to his countrymate John Ram who won US-style Tiger Woods 2&1 in a few games on Sunday.
The incredible pride that I feel, to overcome Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at dai`a old," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods has lost four of his competitions in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 racetrack Ryder Beker record.
A strange statistics by one of the biggest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S.A. has been very difficult to find the cleaning field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who have played high-calibre golf around the tournament.
US captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: "I'm proud of these guys. They fought.
There was a time this morning when we were putting a little heat on Europe.
We deleted.
It's up to Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Berry Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 youths, and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You have to keep your hat clean.
We've been overcrowded."
