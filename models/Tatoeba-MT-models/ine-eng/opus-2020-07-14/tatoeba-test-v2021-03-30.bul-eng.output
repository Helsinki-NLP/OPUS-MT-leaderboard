He looked back at me and turned around.
Go get ready to lie down.
It's not a weapon.
This coat is covered with skin.
I didn't know what I was giving up.
Talking French is a big party.
Did you actually try?
Hey.
These are Tom's dogs.
I'll give it to you for free.
You better not go.
This year the spring is late.
If you don't speak English, the probability of taking a good position is much smaller.
You didn't give me as much rest as you should.
I can find time to help you.

I'll think about it.
Just close your eyes.
She kept the secret for herself.
Is that your chemist?
He disappeared without a trace.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I think that should be expected.
This book is in easy French.
I have to go now.
His desire is finally fulfilled.
Do you want to become a trusted user?
I'm confused.
Why should we help you?
I don't want to go out tonight.
They're serving great food here.
Tom, where are you?
I'll study in French this afternoon.

Please, have patience.
Tom speaks French better than Mary.

Looks like she's got a lot of friends.
It wasn't serious.

Get up, if you like.
Who told you my name was Tom?
That's Tomovo.
I'll be there, too.
Can I open the window?

Speak loud, so everyone can hear you.
It's not our fault.

Honestly, honey, I don't care!
When's the last time you walk to the beach?
Don't give up.

I wish Tom could be here with us today.
I'm in the house.
Do I have to open the window?
Are you sure you don't want to do that?
I have to get to the hospital.
Let me see this.

I need you.
I love listening to classical music.
I agree with his opinion.
Tom can speak French a little.
I'm sure Tom won't want to work late.
I was motivated.
I'll get a job.
Do I have the right to join you?
I couldn't find what you were looking for.
He rarely goes to church.
They understand their neighbors well.
Didn't Tom say anything about it?
French isn't that hard to learn at all.
I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come to your house.
Nobody else offered to help.
Take your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What are your goals?
If we just stop trying to be happy, we'd spend a lot of time together.
I forgot his name.
We're not hurrying.
She's more shy than social.
I got to the station after the train left.
I've never seen a whale alive.
You want to wear my jacket?
I'm not gonna ask him.
Be brief, please.
That's all Tom has to do.
I think you should be crazy not to go.
I miss these people a lot.
I waited so long.
You obviously don't want to do this for me.

I bought some Romanian books for the students.
Are you sure you want to quit?
It's perfect.
I can't afford to buy it.
Where are we going?
I think we need to figure out where Tom is.
I'd like to thank my parents, Tom and Mary.
Are you still happy?
I think you've been here too long.
Did I interrupt something important?
The patient was healing a little bit.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom asked Mary about her family.
Just through my body!

What's in the basket?
I've got documentation to form.
I'll come with you.
Please sign here.

She's a friend of hers.
We'll be together soon.
She was messing with you.
Why don't you follow me?
Tom and Mary had a medieval wedding.
We're always looking forward to Tom's annual visit.
There's no time.
You love the kids, don't you?
I thought you didn't like Tom.
I think we need to figure out who Tom's planning to give it to.
It's amazing!
That's all you really can do.
It's time to take a look.
France borders with Italy.
The simple numbers are like life, they're completely logical, but the rules for them can't be discovered, even if you're spending all your time thinking about them.
Her father made her tell him everything.
I worked this week all the time.
It happens today.
I haven't seen Tom in about a month.
Can you recommend me some other hotels?
All you have to do is move the floor.
Have you seen my camera?
I haven't seen Tom in a while.
Show us.
There's nothing on his mind.
Do good to those who hate you.
I'm going to finish this project.
I'm just looking.
The teacher made him stay after school.
The students didn't remember what they read in this book.

They're gonna make a party for Sam.
Jane is the president's secretary.

The moon is made of cheese.
Their way of life is different from ours.
I don't want to keep you.
This meat is chicken.
I've been older than him for three years.
I think it's okay.
What else is in your pocket?
There was no place else to go.
The man pushed her away.
A hug of you will make me happy.
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
Please forgive me.
We've been waiting a little while.
I hear Boston was pleased at this time of year.
What's your password?
Neither Tom nor Mary is in the cooking room.
The rising prices feed on the concerns of consumers.
I think you'll like Boston.
I've heard every word.

Tom said you'd come.
Honestly, honey, I don't care!
He refused to talk to her himself.
This painting is beautiful.
He didn't say anything that upset her.
That's too little.
I haven't seen you here before.
Their arrival here was a mistake.
He was injured in the disaster.
The question now is how.
I like to speak French.
They spread widespread rumors about the defeat.
It's very short.
Stop going back to your glorious days or you'll stay there.
I'm not tired at all.
What does it mean to come in time if everyone else is late?
The wind blow blew the rain directly in my face.
I want eternal life.
Are you sure you want to hear it?
I think you'll be happy.
That's not a problem.
Did you leave a tip?
Looks like there's no one at home.
I'm gonna have to cancel this request.
So you're just not gonna do anything, are you?
What time is it?
Every time Mary smiles at him, Tom feels happy.

What's Tom's address?
Those two shirts are made of the same material.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Did you write your homework?
I have to decide what my priorities are.
What's your father's name?
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
He's mad at you.
Tell Tom he can't go.
It's getting closer.
I intend to win.
Many of the children were almost naked.
Tom, I think we need to help Mary, it looks like she's in trouble.
They hired a Hamal company to transfer things to a new address.
Will you tell me the way to the garage?
Tom wasn't vindictive.

Give me another chance.
Ken wants a bike.
I like gardening.
They've been drinking coffee for more than two hours.
It's an honor to be here.

Did you see Tom?
I made the first step.
Watch where you're going.

Don't forget me.
I hear you're looking for me.
I'm thinking of reaching the end of her disagreement.
Not all the news can be bad.
We need help.
Don't they speak French?
You both look very young.
I was forced to lie.
This is Tom's favorite camera.
Tom stole my wallet.
Tom didn't have much time.
She read all my books herself.
Tom doesn't make mistakes often.
I can see how confusing this is for you.
She hated him.
You're the boss!
Tom can also speak a little French.
I have to admit that I was worried.
You don't look very happy to see me.
Can I open a can?
Learning a foreign language is interesting.
Tom's a believer.
This book is yours.
Sounds interesting.
I've prepared a list.
I don't make any more money.
It's my brother's.
This dress is worth the money.
Tom's putting his shirt on.
I don't remember sending the letter.
Why does he look angry?
Tom speaks French.
How hungry are you?
We made them keep quiet.
We're here a little late.
Even if I lose my job, I can hold on to my savings.
Which is ours, which is ours.
I have the same number of books as he has.
It's raining yesterday.
I want to love you forever!
I think you should choose Tom.
I'll give you five bucks.
I think Tom did really well.
I'm a teacher.
I'm talking to you as a friend.
They were scared of the news.
My nose's dead.
I'm as strong as you are.
Come on in.
Tom says he's hungry.
I'm an old friend.
Is that your tent?
Is it possible to repair the laundry?
People used to live in the village.
I want to be a teacher.
You're crazy to buy such a expensive bike.
I'm very lonely.
I've been waiting a month.
Please explain the rules in football.
That's a really stupid idea.
It was fun last night.
Are you happy?
Is there any water on Mars?
It's okay.
Tom won't be in the bank at this time.
I don't think you really want to.
Looks like you've made a significant success since the last time I saw you.
The garage is in the center of town.
Don't even try to come.
Both are unpredictable and impatient.
Me, too.
I don't like how you behave.
What are we doing here?
The object is outside the focus of this investigation.
You've been sitting in my place.
You're absolutely right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you'd come.
You need to be careful.
I think we're gonna need Tom's help.
What did you like?
It's gonna be okay.
I almost don't have French books.
Although I'm old, you're still young.
Let's not forget that Tom doesn't understand French.
I'm planning on going there.
A beautiful red-haired late on my room.
I bet you'll be a great father.
Good night!
Someone has to go for help.
They say you play good at the gang.

The prices have fallen recently.
Speaking of travel, have you ever been to Australia?
Tom speaks French relatively well.
I thought it was fun.
I've seen other people do it.
There were thirty witnesses.
He cursed her fate.
I found the key under the hole.
As far as I can tell, they'll agree with us.
You don't have to figure out a reason if you don't want to come with us.
I saw her clean the room.
How are you today?
I'm really interested.
It's your book.
I heard your conversation with Tom.
That's a smaller problem.
Tom asked Mary to take a toothpaste and toilet paper from the super.
You have to work hard.
I don't care about that hat.
What's the minimum wage in YAR?
He's on a diet, because he's a little overweight.
Are we sure we want to appoint Tom?
You take something to drink, you break your way to the Swedish table, and you eat like a pig!
These technical terms are of Greek origin.
That's not Tom's problem.
Keep the rockets safe.
Going home, I saw it again.
Her hair is long.
I put it in your room.
I thought you were serious about Tom.
They won't bother you anymore.
I don't hate it.
I don't teach.
Now it's your turn.
Do you love your mother?
I think you need a break.
Tom's in the mood.
I think what Tom did was very stupid.
I wish I could speak French as a porter.
I'd like to find my account.
I heard you talk.
We became friends right away.
Tom spent the weekend at his house on the shore.
Your black one's leaving.
You know everything about me.
Let me think a little bit and I'll get in touch with you.
They're interesting people.
Please call me from time to time.
Tom checked his pants pockets.
Hold on to the facts.
I wanted to talk to you about your grades.
No one was hurt.
It's not a literal translation, it's actually wrong.
I forgot your number.
How much wheat does this field produce?
I haven't seen you in three years.
Are you sure you want to know?
You can't stop him from drinking.
You're doing very well.
It's your right way, it's your fault.
Will you give me a fire?
He's drinking his coffee every time.
I don't have any information about Tom.
She found a job as a mechanic.
Leave it to me.
They lied to you.
I have to go ask Tom.
You should have worked harder.
Her sweater is purple.
Now that I've registered, what do I have to do?
Clearly, Americans cannot solve even their own problems, so how do they imagine that they are capable of dealing with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so that everyone can hear you.
I'm hungry.
From now on, I'm going to study French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
It was awfully cold yesterday.
I forgot to give him the message.
I finished American literature in college.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
We were confused with anxiety.
I think you'll be happy.
The teenagers left.
I wish I was rich.
I'm just starting.
If you need anything, just call me.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
I've learned a lot.
She bought a toy for the kid.
I was wondering if my e-mail had come to you at all.
She solved her hair in front of the mirror.
Tom tried to take his keys with his fingers on his feet.
His teaching method is both good and bad.
I heard Tom's version of what happened.
Everything I want is you.
I'm looking for a little suitcase.
He became a witness to the murder.
I'm flying for Boston tomorrow.
He made it clear that there was nothing in the matter.
I love the party.
This is the camera I bought yesterday.
The fields are no longer fashionable.
I think we'll need more time.
They'll meet at the hotel tomorrow.
Excuse me, how many are these?
Please repeat it again.
I think so.
A lot of museums don't work Monday.
They put Tom in the hospital to wash his stomach because he eats something poisoned.
Don't make me do it.
You sat in my place.
God don't give it to me!
Your green one's leaving.
I bet you know French.
For dinner, Tom took Mary to a restaurant on the shore of the sea.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
No matter how old you are, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sasayama?
I'll get everything Tom said if it was a lie.
What's the time tomorrow?
Are there any children?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There's no way we can hide this fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I love taking pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you love French wines?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom sat on a doll.
The girls were dancing in the living room.
She is convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
Finally, I stopped at the old house and returned to the city once more.
You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There's a lot of ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I'm crying.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, very bad!
The bus arrived empty.
We need to keep helping Tom.
My mom's got a nice print.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the board.
Tom put his shirt on and then put his tie on.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You can't help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she's good to everyone.
Ken plays football every day.
Here you go at any time.
I don't want tea, I want coffee.
The lawyers and the car mechanics are the people I trust at least.
Would you wait outside?
Can you eat raw strings?
What prevented you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train was 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this compass.
The director considered the opportunity to fire Tom, but decided not to.
He's got to take it off.
Tom's sitting in the window.
I don't think you really want to.
Most of the students were from the West Coast.
Is it possible to be love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom has two kids.
The police shouldn't take bribes.
I was in the mountain.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
Travelers in southern Germany will see farms with solar panels wherever they look.
Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone ringing.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that no one said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I messed up your plans.
I'll ask you to translate this report into French.
No one's wrong.
Everyone jumped.
Many traders were robbed during the riots.
Why do I have to study French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we've been wearing clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's lower than average growth.
I found the key.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who worry about you.
I don't have any prayers.
I don't know Naita Tom that well.
Now I'll tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
In the last ten years, he's been living here.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Oh, shit.
She's calling me Kenji.
I have the information you requested.
In a mysterious way, the sense of humor is related to national characteristics.
Swimming is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
Forget to feed the dog.
I need to study things.
I'll see you.
I used to want to become an astrophysicist.
Tom's got blood back.
This camera is on Tom.
I'm sorry.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
You want me to cut it a little bit?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me to do.
You can do it, come on, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you happy to see me?
I really wouldn't have succeeded without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
With my younger sister at the same time, did you leave?
The sword was delayed for a while.
His brother learns a lot.
Ken's here in Kyoto.
Did you see Tom?
I wish I was taller.
A lot of people visit the museum?
The thieves robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He's coming inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary put on her coat.
That cowboy book could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this book yours?
I've always wanted to learn French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to do it?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He leaned on his lactates.
What's the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's opposed.
What's the minimum salary in New Zealand?
I'm dealing with him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My father smokes rarely.
His intense attempts to seduce her showed him that the address was wrong; she was the mother of two boys.
I lost it.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're related souls.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I have a meeting with him at lunchtime.
In the invitation, he wrote that there would be popcorn and non-alcoholic drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope that helps.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.
Where are the souls?
Mike was running very fast yesterday.
Do you have a European health insurance card?
None of the balls are yellow.
I know a man you need to meet.
I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur is worth a visit.
I couldn't make them understand me.
Do you speak French too?
I just started studying French, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
One boy, not more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the mail.
Tom's still living with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are these explosive?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you a company.
Anna has no sisters.
Tom has little hands.
He arrived two days earlier.
Was it a good trip?
He made me a suit.
Men make houses, women â€“ homes.
Where's the bathroom?
They usually come home before us.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I can't get Tom on the bridge.
If I were you, I'd ask for this job.
The patient was written by the hospital.
My Internet connection is slow.
We have to keep working.
We're gonna be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was fascinated by her opera singing.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
There's another bunch of tourists here.
The door's shut and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
The twin brothers are totally like each other.
Don't mess with Tom.
I didn't understand the smile.
Bass hunts that you know him.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you repeat that if you loved it?
How much money do you have?
Oh, I was sick.
I've got a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Given how long I'm studying French, I should be able to talk to him better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
Do you want to buy a shirt?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to visit Mary's celebration.
You're not just gonna be there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily.
I'm sick of myself.
It's done by Tom himself.
You won't believe what people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
You don't carry much luggage when you're traveling.
I got Tom's picture here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They both work.
Tom didn't come here.
You blame her for lying to him.
There's no point in fooling around, you know she's playing games with you.
George is very excited about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He must be given an advantage in front of the others.
I've moved you.
Take it with you.
Just wait a minute.
I'm swimming once a week.
I waited an hour and a half.
He played for me in public.
It's burning.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Cut it out.
How about we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
That's the picture I took at Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I've never spoken French to Tom.
We all assumed that Tom could speak French.
Tom came back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about the museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You won't believe it.
I'm looking for a house.
I don't feel good.
Why are you so early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a night bird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, right?
Do whatever you want, but I'll stop him if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I need to trust Tom.
I'm thinking about learning to swim during my vacation.
Where's the beach?
Are the Giants playing tonight?
I feel like he's not gonna let me get away with it so easily.
It'll be 5:30 in a minute.
The school starts in eight and a half.
Tom's having a bath.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken jumped over the wall.
The top of the mountain is covered with snow.
A hug of you will make me happy.
When are you going?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right next to the beach, there's a really good restaurant that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the picture.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I totally wiped you out of my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
Do you mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What's the minimum salary in Lithuania?
Here's the hospital I was born in.
Anyone who eats these winds will eat storms.
According to the latest census, the total population of the country is less than 7 million people.
Temporary measures will have no effect on drug dependence.
I don't know where I left the keys.
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Condemned to death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I don't have anything.
At least once think with your head.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
I've been thinking about it for a while.
Don't you have anything else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you get up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We should have obeyed their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so you're asleep early.
That was really stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I have nothing to offer.
I'm talking to my French employees.
It's a picture of my sister.
Tom's having a hard time dealing with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her a piece of advice.
The room was so quiet that I could hardly breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He certainly loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
She doesn't seem to feel well.
Did Spot go too?
I promise I'll bring him back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out of here!
Tom's wearing a sweater.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I have to go talk to Tom.
How about we study in the library together?
I have a job to do.
The proposal for a job is still in force.
Your shirt's missing a button.
I have to go out for a while.
Your green one's leaving.
Push your fingers.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
Uncle gave me this watch.
True friendship is forever.
Tom used to work on the open.
Tom pushed the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm on the bus.
Tom teaches French every day.
In this shop, they're dealing with kitchen supplies.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're expected to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that bakery is nice.
Please, get me another cup of coffee.
Alice might be coming.
How do you do that?
I've had a good time.
I'll stay till noon.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Does any of your team speak French?
Looks like it's starting to snow.
I've never seen anything like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never been to the top of Fuji.
You're not playing golf, are you?
Tom's not working anymore.
It probably doesn't matter.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumps.
What is the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has caused heated debate.
Eat on a live frog every morning and all the rest of the day will not happen to you anything worse.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
The unemployment is growing.
Last night I couldn't blink.
Russia lost 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy smiles.
If you're going to France, you have to be careful about French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
I'm teaching French at school.
He said so himself.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I can't tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please, have patience.
Your joke's getting too far.
I had a really good time today.
Christopher Columbus was drinking unfiltered sea water.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need that.
They're all hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseball player.
Tom still wanted to be unbounded.
I have three children.
Let me sleep for ten more minutes.
Uncle gave me a watch.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom didn't hate you.
Last week I ate pizza every day.
I promise I'll bring him back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
I guess you're wrong.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, he writes something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened a check account.
He was here at the time.
I put my shoes on right now.
He feels uncomfortable in his father's presence.
Your shoes are tied up.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Are you dealing with French every day?
Don't raise that noise, please.
You're pretty good in French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one considered his words important.
That's a weird problem.
I don't understand that.
Where do you live?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time to eat.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They're gonna play basketball after school.
Those clothes are good for you.
There was no way I could say no.
That's a surprise.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they go by bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something personal with you.
He was transported to the hospital with a helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
You're the shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's in love with Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was home alone.
In the exponent, the actual ends are "o". A multiple number is formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to become a doctor when he grows up.
Don't I get a hug?
I'm older than anyone else in my class.
I'm buying tapes.
We're gonna need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come and see us.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's having serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't had a shower in three days.
The triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What's the minimum wage in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you gonna get home?
I wash my clothes.
I've heard that French is a difficult language.
I haven't fed myself.
You'll soon stop thinking about her.
Let me take a look.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big company.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Get up and lie down.
Come on, touch him.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years have you learned French?
Carol's back at her hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered with snow.
Let's get out of here.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
He's off the train.
Mary goes out with two at the same time.
There's still no memory of Tom.
Give it to me.
Did you do anything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was up at 5:00.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can connect to the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't tell me now.
What do you want to tell me?
I'm looking for something not so expensive.
It's much easier for Tom to speak English than French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time, I'll make more effort.
I've done my job already.
He's a hero.
I don't have any demands.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and goodness.
I should have listened to you.
I've got censored hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
It's a little left.
I like that color.
My grandmother was operating in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I saw you and Tom.
I don't think it's true.
I have three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have the chance to return your favor.
Tom had the hammer turned to see if there was any chemicals he could use.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I need to learn the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more accurate.
Tom's French is really good.
Isn't the weather great?
I'm not uncomfortable with that.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You've got to learn hard.
I'll be right back.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom, explain things in detail.
Don't let Tom get away with it.
He was playing football with an empty can.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm a vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put your sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process achieves good results.
That's why his ignorance is understandable.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French isn't good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are those criminals?
Can you get six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll set him up a fair party.
What club are you in?
Atsushi may have been sick.
Tom doesn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth rereading.
We're working together now.
Go back to your place.
He's done Cambridge with a distinction.
I have to get her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Does Tom learn French at school?
What shoes are going on?
We certainly did our best.
I'll delay my trip to Scotland while it warms up.
He started justifying himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do it.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay until tomorrow.
Please call the doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You and half don't know.
That's the picture I took at Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better at it.
My father goes running every morning.
I saw Tom walking down the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She gave up all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Come on.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim's dressed very attractive.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
There's no problem creating a website, just be careful not to violate anyone's copyright.
Tom protected his wife.
She's got a beautiful print.
The fingers of the hand are five: finger, indicator, middle finger, unnamed and short.
The film is made of polyethylene.
I've solved the lightweight task.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How much does a cab get out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have a lot of English books.
We have time until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiized began his worthy respect for the start.
I saw you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, the local cowboys laughed at him.
He looks like he's in the hole.
I think you should come see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more accurate.
I'm on vacation this week.
You're ready for your socks.
I promise I won't do that anymore.
I just gave you blood.
He doesn't know French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep her?
I don't doubt his sincerity.
Please open the package.
I'm married.
I have no idea who he is.
Would you tell me your name if you loved me?
These kinds of mistakes are inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Do you see the game?
This is your home.
The losses were heavy on both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary that it's time for them to leave.
She chews every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Do you prefer to speak in French?
Wow, that's cool.
Don't make my eyes.
I don't have any money.
Honey eats bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't do this without you.
Tom wasn't used to living in town.
Keep an eye on Tom.
Jane's out shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
The long fields are now demos.
He's doing very well with the kids.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates this.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
Finally, the snow stopped pouring, and the weather got warmed up.
She was not making very light hints about what she wanted for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in this book.
I study French every day.
I heard every word.
Where did you get your socks?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used properly are useful.
What do we want?
Keep him secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her vocabulary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't hope so.
What's the price of this tent?
Mom, will you give me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you've changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good with sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to succeed.
I found out he's a genius in chemistry.
It can't be the way you're walking around, starting to abuse people.
I had a meeting at 2:30, but I got stuck up and couldn't get there in time.
They went to the sea museum.
Tom is making a lot of effort to improve his French.
It's been lost for a long time.
They weren't talking.
I didn't call you a fool.
I'm being spoken in French today.
Can you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it inside.
We're all connected.
One word of support when you fail is worth more than an hour of trouble when you succeed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
It's over.
His shirt was fucked with a sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You're not gonna be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it anymore.
I made an Ann doll.
What are you doing, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
The story is very interesting to me.
I read this book.
That was a good year for you.
He was clean.
I can't do this.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy a gift from Tom.
One thing is certain, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was told very soon that he had cancer.
Tom got home from the bus.
For me one meeting afternoon is a better option.
What do you have to do?
Tom studied French three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What's that?
It was too easy.
I travel often.
Here's the hospital I was born in.
I've never loved biology.
I owe you very much for your goodness.
Let's split the prize fifty-five.
Hold my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you'd better lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday here.
I need to know.
Do you like traveling?
Your plan failed.
Tom made a big party in his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long are you gonna have to wait?
Tom is the man who told me when the meeting was to be.
I appreciate your support.
Soldiers started going home.
I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary playing with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy seems so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about people behind their back.
She's an adult.
Come with me to take a walk.
I'm happy to watch the movie.
Whoever's well prepared, don't worry.
I had fun watching TV yesterday.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees whose leaves live on the silkworms.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I've got some news for Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let that happen again.
Put me in pain.
I've tried everything I know.
Why do people fear her?
He's been fighting the hepatitis for six months, but it seems he's been getting better lately.
The universe is a mystery.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
How much is the bill?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in the lab.
Can you tell me your room number?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die simply because they get sick.
I wouldn't have thought the tofu was so delicious.
Are you jealous?
Who's planning this trip?
What time is it now?
So what does that mean?
I haven't had my World War II yet.
He's asking you to help him.
I was only in Boston once.
This one's mine, I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
You think so?
He learned to swim.
You really can't swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too low.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I'm running out of venison.
I can't do it on my own.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about it, then she'll tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell her best friends, and finally everyone will understand.
She was cold.
Tom's talking to the French accent.
I've never seen a long one.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the park.
I thought it'd be best if I didn't say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Do you watch carefully?
A few minutes later, the phone called.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door if you like.
Tom finally left.
Tom assumed Mary wouldn't come to the party.
That's the sweetest bitch I've ever seen.
I'm not mean.
The food is good at this restaurant.
I'm not dealing with this.
Are they wrong?
You parked in my place.
I don't know where he is.
The unemployed make it.
I have to take my son at 2:30.
Sugar is sweet.
Where are you going?
It's a big story.
The prices have recently fallen.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to get rid of me?
If you're late for the check-in, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is that your family?
It was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I won't be able to transfer Tom from the other side of the bridge.
Where are we going?
You can't be mad at me for that.
I grabbed the door cat.
Looks like he's gonna win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There used to be a lot of frogs in that pond.
I get it wonderful.
Depends on the context.
Has anything changed?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers French to German.
You can read in French, right?
Fred's often late for an hour.
Don't cry.
Who's thirsty?
The girl eats bread.
I love baths.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you this dress.
I heard him come down the stairs.
A friend will be here tomorrow.
I hope that's what happens.
Maybe Miss Satou sent the flowers.
Take us to the center.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're driving too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run away?
Who's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You'll get it!
I'm afraid I touched you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's out of his life.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom didn't pay any attention to Mary.
Put these shoes on, if you like.
I heard it was nice.
Tom doesn't like that color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to go.
He's with pink hair.
I don't know when he's coming.
Mary told John the secret.
I'll learn French next semester.
Tom won't speak today.
I'll see you tonight.
My money's over.
I got him a cup of coffee.
Where's your babysitter?
Nothing ever happens like you thought.
Why don't you want to wear a tie?
Children must obey their parents.
Is there a mistake in this exercise?
Can you come by Sunday night?
I remember we met before.
I look at him as my best friend.
Nobody picked up the phone.
I've seen you somewhere before.
You're teaching the esperant.
My new bike is worth 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Keep it till later.
They're best friends.
You're a problem.
You're so superficial.
I have wonderful news.
Looks like it's snowing, doesn't it?
It's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom seems objective.
The tunnel went down because of the earthquake from the day before.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary used to speak Japanese slowly.
What's he doing to you all this time?
My uncle never writes letters.
Close the damn door!
We were playing with him about it.
John came a week ago.
He rejected the proposal, so did I.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Excuse me, I have a request.
The bra is a man who breaks his beards and rips men's hair off.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.
Is that yours, Tom?
We're not all that stupid.
Any problem can be solved if you are persistent and patient.
Tom started studying French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom works there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives somewhere around.
But no one wanted to hear him sing.
Tom wasn't lying on the ground.
I think we can do better.
I think you should think about it.
I'm not crazy.
I'm the most ordinary office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen the kangaroo?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I'm not coming in time.
He often walks to school.
The rats stink.
When are you getting married?
It's a pheasant.
He's off the train.
You're hot.
How many episodes did you see on Van Pice?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is that the difference?
You can take pictures outside the museum, but not inside.
Let me go.
You're sweet and sweet.
My sister lives near Yokohama.
I think you should do the deal.
My intention wasn't that.
I need to get out of here for a while.
She loves the color of her tennis.
Hey, man, I'm asking you a lot - pump some insecticide behind the fridge.
She denied me I didn't answer the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is getting better.
It's your turn.
Put another pair of socks in your bag.
Soon after that, it started to rain.
I have to go back to Boston tomorrow.
They don't want permission.
Tom sent Mary a message written in French.
I'm glad you're happy.
When the conversation is over, he says friendly goodbye and wants me to have a good evening.
Let's check it out.
So far, you've done a good job.
I made dinner last night.
Tom can't stand it.
It's hard for me to concentrate today.
First of all, thank you for your cooperation.
Who told you my name was that?
Aren't you impressed?
Tom's not here today.
I have to buy one of these.
She helped him himself.
I have a job for Tom.
Where did you throw them?
As usual, the physics teacher is late for the hour.
Let's explain what's right and what's wrong.
I forgot to turn off the lights.
Can I take a picture of you?
"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I've seen you somewhere.
You've been sitting in my place.
I've already tried this way.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students don't have to use this toilet.
You're in a winning series.
I want to drink something.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She leaves no time for anything but to take care of the baby.
It's nice to meet you, too.
The movie wasn't as interesting as the book.
Let's go!
I don't want to be worried.
I don't think Tom's number's on the show.
Can you do it on your own?
Thank you very much for the detailed explanation.
I'm the only one who knows them.
She's stuck to her after dinner.
These containers are closed in hermetically.
He's the best player in our team.
I've seen you before.
There's no one.
I want more information.
Are you wearing a gun?
He's saying he's avoided the disaster by pretending to be dead.
Are you home?
Can you tell me what to do?
Watch out for her.
Don't shoot.
Isn't that surprising?
He's friends with everyone he meets.
You need to learn more.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
I just don't understand that.
He's stuck in a house.
I arrived later than usual.
We're not disappointed.
She was trembling out of fear.
I was your mother's first friend.
The Karanica broke our unity.
How much money do I have to take with me?
Tom's dealing with French.
I'm falling for such stories.
I'm used to it.
Welcome to Japan.
She's just shopping.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
"Who are these socks?" "To my sister."
I think you should call Tom.
She was a tall, tight blonde.
I gave Mary a book.
His doco said not to eat between the main meals.
Is there any survivors?
The handle sticks on her feet.
We picked Jack as president.
This is my friend Tom.
They fought each other.
Tom's a French teacher.
We're going down to the next station.
Tom asked Mary to meet him in his office tomorrow.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom's with a light skin.
Thank you, that's all.
The engine doesn't want to burn.
I'm early.
Let's go to the safe.
Jesse immediately accepted the invitation.
Jack Nicholson grew up in New Jersey.
Is there a free will?
I'll be there.
I think that's Tom's motorcycle.
I have to go see Tom.
It's been a long time since the last so beautiful surprise for me.
Let's play Canadian.
I think we've got enough time.

I can't change those plans.
I'll be home soon.
He was on his way to work.
I had a little temperature this morning.

Is that the right direction for the museum?
The school starts in eight and a half.
It happened twice.
Deep breathing is healthy.
When was the last time you went to the beach?
We're out of concern for you.
He can't read.
You're doing all right.
The issues are not going to solve anything.
Maybe I'm wrong.
I hope this will make it easier to understand the meaning and to remember the words of the newest.
I think they know us.
I have no intention of hurting you.
Can you introduce me to a doctor who speaks French?
Are you asleep?
Our team was with red flakes.
How about a walk on the beach?
These dogs are big.
You all say "sir."
Tom won't be paid.
The rain stopped me from going out.
When I was your age, we had to walk up the stairs to school, both in both directions.
He'll be busy tomorrow.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
Nothing more, thank you.
I've already tried.
I think you're working too hard.
He drank a lot yesterday.
This won't help you.
Just do what Tom says.
Prisoners were released.
Be careful with that.

I wrote to my teacher in French in French.
Aren't you coming?
I'll stay till lunch.
I forgot his name.
I think you'll be happy.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Then where's the problem?
It wasn't that hard.
It's a business.
Please lock the safe.
She broke me up.
They're both alive.
I'm too low.
Tom went abroad to study French.
Tom gave Mary his card.
I think it's better to stay with Tom.
He didn't do it, Tom.

Let me tell you something about myself.
We pushed the car.
What's the minimum wage in Germany?
We have something for you.

I think Tom's a good name.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
I heard what happened.
I like your shirt.
I'm telling you, she looks like her mother.
You have to apologize.
How do you know that?
Tom can resist.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I think it's better to give up.
Parents often make sacrifices to provide good education for their children.
Where are you from?
Looks like your dog's thirsty.
You're leaving for London next week, aren't you?
I have plans for tonight.
I wouldn't bet on that.
You don't look too surprised.
Apparently it worked.
I need to learn to do this.
That's a good sign.
Tom jumps through the window.
Let me tell you, it's my fault.
Let me call you.

You're bleeding.
I just want to be with you.
I want to learn French.
She's eating an apple.
I think you should check under the couch.
My car was stolen last night.
Tom wasn't at the party.
Are you satisfied?
Why don't you take a umbrella anyway?
I really want it.
Maybe I'm not right.
Are you done with the breakfast already?
It wasn't my fault.
Read it again.
He arrived earlier than usual.
I talked to him about it on the phone.

They need more research.
That's your responsibility.

Don't punish Tom for that.
I've never seen you so scared.
Tom scored three points.
Do you like walking down the beach?
When will you leave?
Is anyone with you?
Tom couldn't believe what was going on.
Is he having fun last night?
In fact, he's wrong.
They're already here.
Sit a man in the kitchen.
I'll get her back.
When did I close the art museum?

What are you doing now?
The museum deserves to be visited.

Anyway, you'll never understand.
Believe it or not, piglets and badems are from one family.
Do you want to hear something funny?

He raised his hands.
Can I ask you a personal question?
I wish you luck.
I think Tom was trying to warn us about something.
He's married to a nice girl.
I took care of it.
Don't you show interest?
It's something quite different.

Are you speaking Turkish?
I put it in your room.
No one's home.
He still wants to come.
We have to postpone the honor.

Are you wearing your money?
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

"But really?" "Yes, really."
Don't tell anyone.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I have to meet Tom.
Although at times Tom's English seems pretty good, he has no idea where his possibilities are being extended and it's impossible to convince him that he's wrong when he makes a mistake.
Are you John?
America needs you.
You have to decide.
I've seen a lot of tourists on the beach.
I heard you were fighting with Tom.
Will you call me back?

Let's take a walk.
Are you still collecting stamps?
My name is Ichiro Tanaka.

You don't have a temperature.
Did anyone tell you that?
I'm not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens.
Don't let him do it.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I put my coat on the table.
This is the place.
A woman in a wheelchair is hiding in a supermarket.
This is your last chance to spend some time with Tom.
Can you speak French well?
What would you do for a man like that?
I don't like snow.

Thank you, we'll do our best.

From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumps in cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you better do something about it.
I hope things are going to work out for you, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
Corridor's a rat, be careful.
Languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slavic roots.

Are you ready?

Tom can't see you.
Bass hunts that you're busy.
Come see us.
Looks like you had a rough day.
Tom doesn't give up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't spoken to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I kept on filming.
Today, less and less teenagers work.
Why am I still listening to this?
Please don't go.

Tom's hurt!
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
Can we trust her?
That's the camera Tom took the photos with.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your Christmas plans?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.

It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.

I don't care.
I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's hurt.

Tell Tom to explain.
What's your relationship with him?

You want to watch a French movie, don't you?
We played for victory.
What's in the coffee?
It's on fire.
I have to get Tom's money back.
As many books as he has, so do I.

You or them or you!
I hope it's not too late.

If you listen a little more carefully to what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn't as fun as the book.
It didn't work out for me.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is part of the whole, called the universe - part, limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of his consciousness. This illusion is a self-imposed prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our closest people. Our task must be to be freed from this prison, expanding the circle of our suffering, so to cover all living beings and nature in all and beauty.
He'll definitely come.
I know him.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Do I have to fill out this French form?

I don't know who he is.
It's almost three hours.

She rejected his invitation.
We pray for peace.
I think you'll be very interesting.
I didn't offend you with stupid.
He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something in Tom that pisses me off.
Tom's two parents were teachers.
Don't play baseball here.
Does Tom live far from here?
Bad weather didn't allow me to leave.
She's a nice girl.
Bob's a nice man.
Looks like he's happy.
They've come out of my feet.
Why is that so funny?
Follow my example and get a glass of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to figure out when Tom's gonna go.
She read the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot at me.
The dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks about changing the world, but nobody thinks about changing themselves.
She wants to get divorced.
You have to learn hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you a company.
I heard the shots.
I didn't mean to put you in an awkward position.
Who did you translate for?
If there's a desire, there's a way.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
If you relax and rest, you'll feel much better.
Are you done with the breakfast?
I've got some old computers.
Tom was wondering where Mary had spent her childhood.
Are you coming or not?
Do you speak Georgian?
And Tom and Mary pulled out their guns.
Are the cats dreaming?
Do you know this girl?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
This is the hotel Tom usually stays in.
Tom's got some rest.
You better not walk.
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
Let's go ask her.
We usually talk in French.
I'd like a blouse that fits this jacket.
I have no idea what Tom said.
He's a kind of star.
I thought Tom might be your girlfriend.
You always complain.
The milk's off.
The second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.
We need to protect our children.
I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your relationship with him?
The devil's habit must be forgotten.
My brother told me he wasn't afraid of the dark.
Tom, I really hate him.
The problem was I had nothing to say to him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't do it.
Why don't you take your coat off?
Let's talk seriously about your future.
I have a few calls to make, too.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you be so kind as to close that window?
The old couple went on a trip around the world.
When I woke up, there was no one at home, and I was abandoned all day.
My math is my favorite subject.
What day do you usually rest?
Tom came back to pick up his coat.
I'd better go see what Tom found out.
Tom came home all covered with mud.
Did you actually try?
The storm stopped the plane from flying.
Tell me you have good news.
Who are you using a browser?
I remember what he said.
What's the minimum wage in your country?
I think you should think again.
I missed you so much.
What reader are you going to take - Kindle, Nook or Kobo?
Is this your book, Mike?
In principle, I run every hurdle.
The caller called at eight o'clock.
Mr. Smith has been charged with a breach of the contract.
Ken's running faster than you.
They talked to each other.
Do you sleep, honey?
She gave birth to twins.
Five gallons normal, if you like.
I haven't been here much.
Take care.
That's very big.
I think you'll be surprised.
Do you speak German?
Put on your coat.
I bought a few books from the bookstore.
Be nice.
It's been a terrible accident yesterday.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put your tourist shoes on and don't waste your time.
Why did you come so early?
If you're judging by your great ten, you seem to have spent most of your vacation on the beach.
It's probably snowing tomorrow.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura could have been sick.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Tom can resist.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.
There was a museum of art in this area before.
I thought your feelings might have changed.
Sooner or later, his luck will end.
He's lying he's gonna go wrong tonight.
Anna has no sisters.
Is it really so hard to speak French?
When was the last time he was traveling with a train?
Tom saw it, too.
I'm not trying to push you.
You're running.
Don't stay in bed unless you can't make money out of bed.
Tom has to do this now.
I could make you happy.
My dear, if the meal isn't over until seven o'clock, I'll go to the restaurant.
He let me wait a long time.
I'll be right there.
They made us work all night.
He likes English very much.
I understand about your party.
They have to change their mood.
Do you want me to repeat the question?
The book is interesting.
She was young.
They're hiding in the wardrobe.
What's the minimum wage in Russia?
He loves her.
Try to figure it out when the train leaves.
You have to deal with French more seriously.
I want to go there once more.
It's really stupid of you to say something like that.
They have to pay in advance.
Do you love music?
He was born and raised in Tokyo.
I guess I'm working.
She waited until the water closed before making tea with her.
I think Tom speaks French well.
Tom has to go.
He was very patient.
It's not likely they're coming in this late hour.
The teacher said he'd do it in three months, so we could all speak French without stopping.
I caught three fish yesterday.
He goes there every day.
It's a disaster.
Have you ever heard anyone speak French?
And no one's talking about what I told you.
We want to rent an apartment in town.
I think you should come down here.
We arrived yesterday afternoon by train.
Tom left, but Mary's still here.
Pick your favorite rocket.
I'll take you with the sushi.
That's it for today.
My brother claims he's not afraid of the dark.
Save a man.
It's all right.
Are you sure you don't want me to help you?
Tom speaks French awfully.
Don't you take credit cards?
Tom's drinking water.
Did he offer you?
You want me to help you?
You don't have to go.
Please give me a pill.
What's Tom afraid of?
You always sing.
I totally forgot about Tom.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My father was about to leave when I called.
He was asking about you.
Ken never went to Kyoto.
His fog stopped him from seeing it.
Ann's a major.
I'm trying to learn English.
Tom went to the mail to send a letter.
Look carefully at the map of the wall.
Maybe it's not enough.
Don't send me any more notes.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I think you'll be very interesting.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
I haven't taken a shower in three days.
I've lost my form.
Bring me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'll be happier on another job.
I like your shirt.
That's very important.
Thank you for your work.
You're right on the road and when you get through the lighthouse, you're there.
Do whatever you want.
Some people would certainly ask why we just don't collect things and get out of Afghanistan?
Wake up your socks if you like.

I'd like to get your picture.
Please, get him back.
"What brand is your car?" "Ford is."
I tried to be your friend.
His wifeâ€™s second cousin was a member of the Jewish Governing Council.
Would you help me translate this?
America has enemies.
Did you see Tom?
We'll be back.
Give it back to me!
Say hello to Jimmy from me.
I haven't spoken to Tom in three weeks.
Stop whining.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you're wrong.
He didn't stop him from standing up all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you've asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't need to know that.
Some people have the inability to travel by sea.
My plane flew in six hours.
I don't know any of the boys.
We're ready to go.
That's a picture.
It's really delicious.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
Maria showed us their home.
I heard the steps, but I didn't see anyone.
Is that our problem?
He gave her a letter.
Uncle gave me his car.
I really appreciate that.
Tom put his helmet on.
I've never seen anything like it.
I have an opinion.
I did it myself.
My name is Emily.
Nothing else is done.
I have to get dressed.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
I still haven't understood that.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night, the game was exciting.
The wide jackets are the last piece of fashion.
Don't get lost.
With a little good will from both sides, our problems should be able to be solved.
I don't have much money.
She's going up the stairs fast.
The house we used to live in has been demolished.
I'll get married next week.
The prices will continue to rise.
We learn French together.
In high school, my French was my favorite subject.
Would you call Tom?
No one knows whether he loves her or not.
Get me out of this side of the lighthouse if you like.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Oh, I was sick.
Show us.
Why don't you laugh?
Have you ever congratulated PfirsichbÃ¤umchen on German?
It's an accident.
I would never hurt them.
I know about this investigation.
Won't it be nice?
I don't know French, but Greek is quite.
He made it clear he was against the plan.
She can jump high.
Why do I sleep so much?
She answered through tears.
When are you going?
Hannah grew up higher than her mother.
That's quite different.
The elephant is gray.
He's studying French at home.
Don't raise that noise, please.
Did any of you ever see Tom?
I'll go alone.
He's stronger than you.
I'm dangerous.
Show me this list.
That's all Tom has to do.
Our son is getting married and we want to do our heads.
Don't go to that building.
Why isn't Tom at school?
Are you going to eat that cupcake?
I worked hard last month.
I knew he'd take it.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talk.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
This could prove a little burdensome.
Looks like our water's over.
Take what you like.
I have to tell Tom.
That was very personal.
Do they both understand French?
Something's been taken.
The green suit belongs to Alice.
We're meeting three times a week.
They caught the fox in the trap.
You're early.
You love the kids, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sad.
They're late for the storm.
I guess it won't be a problem.
Talk more slowly, if you like.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel really bad.
We were soldiers.
Hard work is not only a necessity, but pleasure.
We need to be careful.
It's eleven now.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom there.
How was the last weekend, Nancy?
Are you learning French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not unreasonable.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You need to use a deodorant.
When I stand up, you're the world.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I need to take care of.
I never doubt his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not going to take part in this.
You don't look too surprised.
This is a warning that we need to take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat, can you serve us fast?
Let's get our bags.
Tell me a joke.
Tom is practicing to speak French at every opportunity.
I saw Tom do amazing things.
The apples are red.
You have good hands.
People are all against war.
Your hair needs a boost.
I'm better.
Tom hasn't met me before.
Can I see your driver's book?
That's never gonna end.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
Who's hurting your teeth?
We're learning French.
What makes you think that?
You've been sitting in my place.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
I teach French every day at school.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Tom seems lonely.
Let me tell you something about myself.
I haven't seen Tom since I was 13 years old.
Her hobby is to collect postmarks.
I don't have anything.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to speak more than we were to hear, we would be given two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I got your coat.
Last night we had a great time.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You won't believe how popular Tom is.
Did you do it?
My father often takes me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's friend threatened to leave him.
Don't you fear anything?
He didn't know anything about it since he left for America.
Now I'm gonna have to deal with this.
I had my hands in my pockets.
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Did you talk to your sister soon?
They're all hungry.
She's down the stairs.
I was alone, I learned.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think you'd better sit down.
Our sales are coming.
I saw Bob this morning.
Get me something to eat.
If you have not paid for the lack of supervision, please send the due amount and allow us to remove the problem immediately.
It smells like a toilet here.
I'm here for a break.
Looks like you're alone.
The question is being considered.
Tom was rescued from a random passerby.
The village is in the center of the city.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm so hungry.
It's very kind of you to get out of your way to help me.
Tom decided Mary's story was interesting.
How about we stop the car and get some rest?
Tom lives in the same part of the city that Mary lives in.
Now it's a little after eleven without a quarter.
Both speeches are correct.
I've never seen the dark before.
We need to call the police.
I have information about Tom.
I'm sure this book has never been translated into French.
I'll see you again.
I'll try it again.
No one could sleep that night.
Runda took about five minutes.
He was walking around the country.
The sum of all angles in the triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
Mary can speak Japanese.
I need to call Tom.
It's a little cold today.
I'll judge you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who let the dogs go?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French, and what I'm left to say.
I'll give it all to myself.
I'll come with Tom.
Mike swims very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that'll take me away from here.
Let's talk.
The diamonds are the best friends of the girl.
Even when he was young, his parents died, so he raised his uncle.
I saw Tom do the impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the garage?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't bark.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'll follow your instructions.
I have a sharp knife.
You colored the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches me to arrange flowers.
What a wonderful time!
Don't waste your youth, or you'll regret it later.
I think you'll be interested.
But isn't he above the law?
A modern factory is fully automated.
Don't let Tom scare you.
The adoption of English is difficult.
I think you should join us.
Can I open a can?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom in a while.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a lonely beach.
Why did Tom want to study French?
This is the place Tom was born.
Where were you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea what's going on.
You're all stupid.
They exchange gifts.
I don't mind.
Mr. Kolkot's Japanese food started to like him.
I put the money in the safe.
We're in a hurry.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You need to get closer to this fact.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first girl.
Tom teaches me to speak French.
Would you tell me something about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.
I want to find my account.
I'm sure Tom knows enough French to fix it.
I went to swim in the river.
Mary's Tom's older sister.
I don't know either one or the other boy.
Guests need to start coming soon.
I'm crazy about football.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
It was very nice!
This isn't your house.
I didn't see anything.
Hey, I just came here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushes Mary from the edge of the rock.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Get ready for the worst.
Fruit the nest under the sun.
She's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes on the control.
Time's on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It could take a while.
I thought you could quit.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Watch out, car's coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take it with you.
Now I remember, you don't have to smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happily.
He's only four minutes from here with a train.
What is Tom trying to achieve?
Can anyone believe you?
It's a little fat.
I think we better go.
Tom said he probably wouldn't take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do it?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, keep your mouth shut!
I would never hurt them.
I've learned French.
Can't you just stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Tom's two parents were teachers.
Children must listen to their parents.
It's boring today.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of everything.
He returned home after he had been away for ten months.
We're moving to Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's rest here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we were interested in Tom.
I'll catch the next bus.
Tom's twice as old as Mary.
Mary has two boyfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not so tired.
You have a vein infection.
He started writing a novel.
He's happy with the result.
Hurry up and you can catch your train.
You won't need this anymore.
Get him back where you got him.
Let's get started.
I fucked you up.
Tom found out Mary was stealing from the cash in the cash register.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it anyway.
Can you do it on your own?
She's exhausted.
You got me so stupid?
If you give someone $20 and you never see it again, it's probably worth it.
That's Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum wage in India?
Don't make a decision on this issue today.
She didn't have much money.
You've been sitting in my place.
When did Tom die?
These two rices are made of the same material.
Are you learning French?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year, we'll study in college.
What do you eat, fish or meat?
I made a check.
I thought Tom had a rest day.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of terms for DNA, but there's no one for RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to this.
Don't mess with your nose.
The wind blew at the gates.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her great daughter is married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
Of the twenty students, only one read the book.
I've got work to do on Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have the tendency to trust established authorities.
I came home with a train.
I think I can do it in my spare time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
What kind of situation would you do that?
What was the name of the guy you dated before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired, and I want to get laid early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philologist.
She lives in New York.
He must be the principal of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you.
He was painted like a clown.
In her presence, I'm uncomfortable.
She bought him a dog, but he had an allergy to the dogs and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
At that time, there was no television or radio.
She went to a taxi museum.
Look at your job!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes on their feet.
Tom likes to play.
You're a good doctor.
Don't you ever say that again.
I saw him stop.
She felt like she was shaking her knees.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him again.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
This is my CD, isn't it?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a group of kids he doesn't need.
It'll be fine if you don't get involved in personal affairs.
Do you have to go to the mail?
My veins bleed every time I use my teeth.
We arrived fast because the movement was not loaded.
You must be careful.
What do you miss?
He came back from France soon.
Molly has a big watch.
Tom doesn't help me.
I haven't been in touch with him for a long time.
Those glasses are on your way.
What did you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
You don't eat until you get it over with.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's watching a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is French more difficult than English?
I don't care about that pair of shoes.
Are you afraid of something?
I have two cousins.
The list falls in the autumn.
Aren't you going to do something?
I'm sure Tom didn't hate you.
We can't postpone the board.
Since when did Tom learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
Hey, I'm a little sick.
I'm so ashamed.
Looks like there's already over two thousand Ugurian sentences in Tatoeba!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't postpone the collection.
I'm ashamed I did that.
Let's cut over here.
I know that's hard.
Are you an exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
Do you think you're going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were arrested?
If mankind does not care about the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thank you.
I felt rejected among these people.
I think you're gonna have a good time tonight.
Don't take it back yet.
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
The fact that he's too generous is his greatest lack.
Press the Shift key.
You understand, right?
Jane always acted like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know him.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It doesn't matter.
I have nothing against the hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new visits.
I'm thirsty.
The flowers are wet with no water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to understand why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom couldn't swim.
I forgot.
The bill, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Know what he told me.
Solta's done.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go meet him and then release this letter.
This chicken hasn't had an egg in a while.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
The dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school is going well.
Mrs. Yung didn't mind me visiting her unexpectedly.
You have good lips.
A lot of people will lose their jobs because of the car industry's sweating.
He came to my aid.
We're going to start the landing down in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food's about to end.
The moment of glory for Hanshin didn't last long, they were quickly displaced from the first place.
Is there a big house?
Won't that lead to trouble?
He's upset that he's called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
You really want it?
Will he fail on trial?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What was the outcome?
We're finally here!
I'm taller than you.
I think I'm lucky.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I didn't feel well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
I have to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a pie on the kitchen window to make a toast.
Happy is the man who's married to a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He's always telling the truth.
I can't live like this anymore.
Ah, how sad!
Say hello to Jimmy.
Is it good for you?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't make me shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth's globe into two half-lifes.
It was personal.
Aren't you interested?
It's a great pleasure to watch baseball games.
I think it's good to rest a little.
When did you start learning French?
She solved her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it's gonna work today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where did you throw them?
Tom, how's he gonna deal with the problem?
The thief got away with the money.
I haven't talked to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This camera's on Tom, right?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
Uncle gave me a watch.
Please, excuse me for the delay.
I felt isolated.
I'm busy.
They're very important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My friend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Measure that sweater.
I'd better stay home.
That's not very fun.
The phone's something you can't do without.
A few days ago, I contacted them, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My dad's driving very well.
We need to protect our children.
To a new meeting.
I'm completely exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistic.
I heard you encourage them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I intend to go to France in the summer.
Please mix the cards carefully.
Get on the bus to Badstrace and get down to Zeestrace.
The smile is useful for your health!
It's not a mistake.
I guess you're the Tom they all told me about.
Add this site to Favourites.
When the sun of culture is low, even the jets throw a big shadow.
When's the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He's sitting on his bench.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a meeting in prayer.
I'm not going to face the threats.
You're in a better shape than me.
Do you have a goose?
I hope it's for the good.
He tried it himself.
I'm from the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He's standing up late.
Tom's getting better.
I'm walking like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch your step.
Can I get you a knife?
You have to report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you'd told me earlier.
Don't look in the camera.
Wally, but we're gonna go anyway.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret it.
I thought Tom would cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want something to eat.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even get the water to boil if it burns a turkey.
What's the name of this river?
Is she free tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
During the winter, the six are covered with ice.
We're almost out of time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm already full-time.
I want to go.
Bring her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want a orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I'm not gonna be surprised if Tom left earlier.
Tom speaks French as French.
I think we should make a deal.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you'll need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Get me something to drink.
Am I gonna die?
I got a little more caught up while I was dancing, and I got up on the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into a pound.
I think Tom lied to us.
I'm gonna make Tom smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and die for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking the wrong way.
Tom has the right to know.
Your wind.
She took a test.
I'll study the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do it?
I've met him before.
Tom didn't give up.
Tom wasn't in trouble.
I made a few mistakes on the test.
This book isn't Tom's property.
Where was that?
I have to get him out of here.
Can I do something to help Tom?
Take your glasses off.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work in a hospital.
Tom's already a mature man.
Let's not lie.
I've fixed myself.
It's not art, it's a tooth fairy.
I didn't see you either.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so responsive.
Did you hear about him?
She's sending the blouse soon.
Is anyone with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Does Tom really want to win?
My grandfather loves to read.
Did you know you were wearing different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, honey.
Tom had a unique desire.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary on Friday night, and Alice on Saturday night.
Looks like it's gonna work.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read in French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
Letter card.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
I'd better make sure.
I can't help you.
He came out of the car.
He writes to his mother from time to time
Men get in shape driving a wheel.
This isn't the end of history yet.
Don't be quick.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get some rest under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Get me a dry coat.
Jim's name is James.
Are there any other hotels you can recommend?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
More research is needed.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Ann's a little girl.
Just push your fingers.
I went to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep province.
Excuse me.
I don't have ammo.
You're my best friend.
I organized a meeting.
I didn't tell anyone about us.
It was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French texts?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid the video for five contributions.
I just want to go with you.
She became twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What does that mean?
They come from Sweden.
Watch out when you cross the loaded street!
A man has to work.
That's intriguing.
What is your nationality?
That part is good.
Merry Christmas!
Come down.
Mary's on her way.
They're longing for the city's life.
I'm glad you did it.
The dog was walking around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It's between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom gave up too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discuss it.
Let's eat the sushi.
Throw out those socks if you like.
Please, be more careful in the future.
Tom was obsessed with panic attacks.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say such things.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The room is completely furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom travels first class.
Don't stay out too late.
I'll have a rest day tomorrow.
I didn't say that either.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this if you love it?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you solve this problem?
I think that's enough for you.
You told me that again.
It's been six years since I started learning English.
I can't buy you this dress.
I work as a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed Tom usually doesn't lock his door.
Would you help me translate this?
Tom doesn't understand anything from French.
This is the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This climate feeds on a lot of streams.
Don't touch this propaganda hunt.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be lifted.
First the good God made the man, and then the woman made him. Then he had compassion on the man, and gave him tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't raise any noise.
Don't look them in the eye.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Does that look familiar to you?
Take your coat.
What money do you have?
That won't change anything.
The building's almost over.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Aoi's dancing.
Today, machines can do a lot of things for people.
He went for a walk.
Please start now.
I've seen your driver's book.
Where's my room?
Tom suffers from flatness.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Human foolishness is infinite," I say, and because of this self-criticalness, I consider myself an exception.
The storm did not stop, on the contrary, becoming stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter into French.
Unemployment is still high.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't come to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Would you like that, Tom?
The whole show's going to the backyard.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I want things to be like they were.
Show me.
Tom got his tooth removed last week.
The more you run, the more you get tired.
Don't hide how you feel about it.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open my door?
The girl's Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom often gets sick.
The key doesn't go into the key.
What is the minimum wage in Italy?
Tom turned on the lamp again.
This bike is mine.
I'm not used to eating angry.
Choose what you like.
Go over there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
It's not from me.
When my father found out I was dating Nimrod Nick, he was very angry.
The teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we'd have breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find out it's Tom's fault.
She put her sweater on.
Sometimes my money's over.
Don't worry, Mr. President: with such bad veins, it hardly even has the teeth.
I haven't seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a nice little house.
Get back to bed.
Why don't you try the dress before you buy it?
Tom killed himself, jumping from one rock.
Where were you born?
These clothes are good for you.
They went straight to their goal.
The boy came in through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The bill, please.
I thought you'd be happy.
Are you done with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's shoe.
Do what you think is right.
Don't you fall in love with Tom?
Persistence is paid off.
They've arrived separately.
Speaking French is fun.
Tom won't make it.
Get ready for the worst.
I believe the Earth is being monitored by extraterrestrial intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think it's a mistake.
My dad's walking in the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each of them a single prayer.
Don't drag me down.
I think you should let go of your beard.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another drink?
Many people share my view on the matter.
The blouse is clean.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He's finished his big start at the end.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a court to be filled, but a fire to be set on fire.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Order the words in alphabetical order.
Tom can speak French much more hungry than I do.
I'll hide in here.
She was worried about her sick husband.
He was playing while he was leaving.
I brought the girl back to the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English, but I can't speak German.
I don't have insurance.
He finished Yale with honor in 1921.
I think I have a way to save you some time.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and kept it open for Mary.
We make cheese and butter from milk.
How many episodes of One Piece have you seen?
I didn't mean it.
I'm a vacation this week.
If a sick woman swallows a thousand paper jars, her desire will be satisfied.
I'm surprised that this building is still standing.
I don't owe you at all!
The bus driver didn't see a pedestrian.
Why did you leave?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my vacation in Hakone.
Take a look at these documents.
I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They're drinking tea in the hall.
Tom set the engine on fire.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
It's 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that enough for you?
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Your bike's better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're guys.
Bad weather stopped us from leaving.
Now he's learning French.
Because I didn't know where to go, so I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm so busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You're in a winning series.
I can't be mad at you for that.
The spread of television has significantly deprived us of our time for reading.
I'm gonna need forever to explain everything.
Don't blow me up in the basement.
The new coronavirus is highly infected.
Every time I look for you, you're gone.
You're going down to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm officially here.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here until 2:30?
Tom taught me to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a hot cup.
I have to fix this.
I've prepared breakfast.
He's following English literature.
The knife is stupid.
She looked at me a lot.
It's forbidden to smoke in school buildings.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
I love you more than anything.
Why did you come so early?
Some people are able to sing well, others are good listeners.
I didn't understand the last word.
No matter how rich she is, she's not happy.
Go and see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses somewhere?
You can meet him.
Close your textbooks.
I hear someone's coming in.
Tom went on his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can also speak Russian.
Japan has many excellent drawings.
Do you believe there's a god?
I'm dating the dog tonight.
What's your blood group?
Ten houses were burned.
I shouldn't have let you do it on your own.
Condemned to death.
I've been waiting for only five minutes.
Will you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house is burning.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How heavy is your daughter?
Tom shouldn't have done that.
I'm an atheist.
I never write the words "borch" and "schi" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom's knee was covered.
I'll come back to the hotel with you.
Give me some milk, too.
I think she's over forty years old.
Are you wearing the driver's book?
I don't need your help.
He's in front of the door.
My business is renegotiating.
The keys are on the table.
I went to the park.
He reported the police crash.
I don't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid you can't talk about promotion right now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you afraid?
I haven't talked to anyone today but Tom.
I almost can't hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He drinks a medium-sized amount of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You put your socks on the other side.
We just got information from your brother-in-law Kansas.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Does this new model have it on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect anyone to like you.
What's it really about?
Take care of Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.
Cut it out.
She got the ticket without giving anything.
A lot of people think retro cars are pretty expensive.
GDP for the third quarter exceeded 1% of the previous quarter.
I'm sorry, I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you see anything there at all?
Everyone was at work.
I'm done with the gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it the way you told me to do it.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was on my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the deal.
Not as much of the disease as the scar.
Aren't you afraid, Tom?
God is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the movie, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to study in my house?
Go back to your bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog also watches TV.
Let's get to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
He's watching TV sometimes.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
It's only 30 minutes before the train leaves.
Participants are preparing for the final round of the competition.
I have plans for Saturday night.
Like I'm tired.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Our arrival here was a mistake.
Don't hurt us so much.
It's her hobby to collect postmarks.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be fine.
That's not what Tom's gonna understand.
Don't forget to bring your kitchen utensils like knives and cooking vessels.
We're here.
Where are you going?
We're going to the beach.
I promised I'd never do it again.
Jane sometimes runs to school.
I think you'd like that.
I could make you happy.
Every student has a locker.
Have you seen a koala?
Tom couldn't believe Mary really loved him.
I can't buy you this dress.
I think you panicked.
He went out to go.
I hope you're right.
At least 100 people attended the meeting.
I know you're right.
My vacation plans have failed.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
He came to Tokyo and married her there.
I don't think it's true.
I lost my sense of time.
He thought this could be a number.
It's probably the greatest poet.
What's your problem?
I'm going to visit my grandmother at the hospital.
Hell is a place where it smells bad and no one loves anyone.
Tom took his knee off.
Where's the bathroom?
I have to report this.
That's enough of you with French, isn't it?
He postponed the celebration.
Marie said Tom was her cousin.
They caught five peppers.
Do it for me.
"How are you doing, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
What exactly happened to you?
Take the car to the garage.
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
I saw his father drive.
Keep your room clean and clean.
I had a bad night.
She didn't like her husband.
I've been studying his face for wear marks.
Music is the common language of humanity.
Give me some sugar.
I'll take you home.
I wonder if Tom would teach me French.
It would be a pleasure for me to sing for you.
Can you ride a horse?
Tom's really interested in drawing.
Tom's not ready.
Are you alive?
It's Copacabana!
Maybe it's true, but I don't believe it.
I waited as long as I could.
You can't hide from me.
I don't want to be different.
Look how I do it.
We're going to the movies.
He used to go to a movie with her.
You can't smoke in this room.
I heard Tom's membership was suspended.
I'll be with you if you go do it.
What's the name of the hotel in Boston that you stayed in last year?
That's a complicated problem.
Now it's exactly 10:00.
It's like the wind.
Are you also a virgin?
He's known as a great poet.
We're not gonna be here after 2:30.
I saw Jesse stand there.
I bought books from the bookstore.
I have to buy one of these.
I love sports.
He's often late.
I wish I had a friend like you.
I speak French every day at work.
I don't believe in coincidences.
He's nice.
I'm still a little busy.
I just couldn't make Tom understand.
He's one of my neighbors.
We're almost done.
I closed my door.
I could make you happy.
I've never seen anything like it before.
Open the bottle if you like.
I'm smarter than you.
The latest innovations in medicine are remarkable.
You have to control yourself.
I'm not interested in doing that.
Tom thinks it's gonna work.
Can you speak French?
They canceled it as lost.
I waited three days.
Material wealth often goes hand in hand with rejection of society.
Did you count your socks?
You have to find a real job.
You two have nothing to do with it.
Many scientists live in this small village.
I'm sure Tom understands French.
I didn't know we shouldn't.
You're a good singer.
The cat's eating.
I'm used to my parents not paying attention to me.
Speaking of travel, have you ever been to Australia?
I thought you'd be tired.
I need to see you.
Nancy looks like my sister.
Tom doesn't like math.
He educates his children well.
I was just being kind.
Tom's growing tomatoes in his garden.
I like to go fishing.
She gave me access to her records.
Aren't you Tom?
She seems to be a young woman shy.
It's made by Tom.
You can read French, right?
I'm so sleepy.
Be more accurate.
I was a vacation.
No one will understand.
Tom goes out to drink every night.
The museum is closed today.
She gave me a shirt.
Tom didn't put his belt on.
You think you're funny?
That's what you decided.
Where's the library?
The boy put all his clothes in the bag.
Bring me the magazines.
She tied him to the table.
I'm young.
The city is big.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
You owe it to me already?
Will you teach me to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom's still tough.
The problem seems much more complicated.
Drinking water.
Don't worry.
Tom's not good lately.
I need to tell you something first.
One coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have another choice?
He's alone.
In China, we put the first family, and then the name.
Give it to him.
The boy palely reminded his father of his appearance.
He always manages to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked me right in the eye.
Don't stop for me.
How do you distinguish them?
Time's on our side.
Do you love your mother?
They've improved their results.
Don't hurt them so much.
Where's the boss?
When can we say that a person has alcohol problems?
Is there anyone at the station to meet me?
I haven't heard it in a few months.
I don't play both.
I read an exciting story.
Don't be afraid.
That's kind of a question I understand.
Why aren't you here?
Tom is the man who gave me this bike.
We're not going to burn under the pressure of tyranny.
Tom is a complete mystery.
I'm wearing sunglasses.
I don't know why Tom's so angry.
I'm so glad to see you again.
Don't make me stay here.
It's food.
Would you pull this off?
Who's your favorite bird?
Everyone but me was invited.
I didn't say that either.
He loves geography and history.
Did you come here?
Do you have any subordinates who speak French?
I don't have much to talk about in French.
Ask him about the road to the garage.
Bill's been fishing for the day.
I'm looking for my glasses.
I'm giving up.
My eyes are tired.
The passengers on the bus were fifty.
Tom works in a wine cellar.
Tom had nothing to do with it.
Who's listening to Tom?
I think Tom's asleep.
Children often cry because they want to pay attention to them.
I'm curious.
Please wake me up at six in the morning.
I feel uncomfortable with her.
We don't want you to feel pressured.
The saffrons are dried grapes.
I was in India.
The coffee break is a tradition in America.
I told you what I know.
They have another plan.
Life is full of opportunities.
We were driving when we changed.
If you want anything, don't hesitate to tell me.
Tom wasn't that bad.
I can't find my glasses.
Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with Tom?
You look tired.
He plays baseball after school.
The sound of the terrible song made him panic.
Do you have this shirt in black?
It wasn't a celebration.
Amy ordered a new dress.
I've seen you on TV.
Meg's talking too much.
I've put things down.
I can't believe my eyes.
There's no place to worry.
We've got physical.
Are you having fun yesterday?
That sweater's worth over $50.
Just leave him with me.
I don't like doctors.
Tom refused to speak French.
Tom doesn't make Mary wait too long.
Tony didn't know what they were called.
That's for Tom.
This is where Tom was born.
My car's in service.
I've got an old bike.
Don't you speak English?
Tom won't let you pay.
Spread your shirts before they get stuck.
I'll be there.
Don't get too fast.
Why do you know that?
You're a cop.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.
His investment brought him 6%.
Let's have dinner.
I have to get to Tom.
Don't throw them away, then you'll need them.
Who's Tom's friend?
He convinced his mother to give him extra money.
This book was easy.
I fixed his radio.
I went to Magistral 58.
I think Tom's scared of you.
Don't let me die here.
I've never seen you so nervous.
I think we should go.
Open your shirt, please.
I almost forgot.
Tom can't forget the first time he and Mary had a serious fight.
You're in danger here.
I'll say I did it.
I don't have anything.
If you need help, don't worry about looking for me.
We managed to get some foreign brands.
I laughed.
It's hard to explain.
We got on a trip to Shinjuku.
The police are investigating the case.
You're drinking from my watch.
It was cheaper than I thought.
How's the job going?
I've written a few songs in French.
Nancy loves music.
The phone's a comfort.
Are you selling French newspapers?
Now the service is yours.
I'll be gone tomorrow.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom went there to study French.
I haven't said yes yet.
I barely got along with the saints.
Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom's very modest.
Thank you for that.
But the ball, the Turkish panic, you're missing Vancho, our captain.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.
I want to go to the same school Tom intends to register.
The condition of the wounded is improving.
We've got a lot of lotus lists.
We are firmly convinced that when I make statements, the author must avoid succumbing to the harmful habits of using too many unnecessary words, which are actually absolutely excessive in the light of the whole sense.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom said, "Move, make your way and sit down.
I forgot his name.
Is Bob right?
I need to know.
When does it end?
He's after me every time I see blood.
Don't go!
I thought we'd make it by 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.
I've seen Tom do some pretty remarkable things.
He couldn't pass the test.
Almost all students love English.
God knows what can happen in an hour!
I fell asleep reading a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't so strong.
I'm not a king.
They've made their way through the crowd.
Bring him in.
I doubt Tom's staying.
It's too expensive!
Good-bye!
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
The police searched the house and found two kilograms of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is this close to your house?
Jane filled out a statement.
I could make you happy.
Why is your French so good?
Fools run where angels are afraid to step.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
I've been doing sports my whole life.
I'll eat here.
I love tennis.
Do you allow me to come in?
Is it hard to learn French?
I've been waiting so long to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm very happy.
You don't have to say things like that when there's kids around here.
He's making it easy.
I want to improve my French speech.
You won't believe what I heard.
I'll study Tom.
Today the train is ten minutes late.
There's silence.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do that?
She didn't like him.
You learn French, don't you?
I have to go to the meeting.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should speak English.
She's getting better.
What are you doing this weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
Checkmate's not opening.
Try to calm down.
We need to investigate the date of the test.
Maybe he's confusing us with the obvious.
Everyone dies.
Tom's a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll listen to your advice.
A few days ago, my computer stopped working.
In Japan, almost every family has a laundry.
We're staying in Boston next week.
The garage flew away.
Will you marry me?
Close your books.
What exactly are you dealing with, what is the scope of your research, your main interest.
You're shaking.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go say hello to Tom.
I think Tom's drunk.
I've had a lot of head.
Why don't you sleep?
Mark Zuckerberg is an atheist, not a believer.
There's a little chance I can't make it to the meeting.
He always said hello with a gift.
How do I know?
Wouldn't you go?
I think you should see this.
He can read quite well.
Tom's okay, right?
She blew up in the newspaper for a while.
J.F. Kennedy was buried in the cemetery in Arlington.
I'm not giving up.
What are you interested in?
I could make you happy.
Carlos set up the mountain.
He added some sugar to the coffee.
Give me your shirt.
I don't take any drugs.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to catch his audience.
He'll get to Hakodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man has to work.
Hello!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I've recently been very explosive. My favorite football team is west.
I made it easy for him to connect to the sweet stories.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what I saw that night.
I studied French for three years with a language teacher.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there until it's still light.
Tom's hurt.
His room's a mess.
They set aside part of their free time to care for the sick.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
I really don't think Tom intends to go.
Ask Tom.
Let go of the radio.
I'll stay three more days.
We delayed the departure for tomorrow.
Nature doesn't know the boundaries.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to know what the truth is.
If John had come, I wouldn't have to come.
You better put your sweater under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is it?
I heard you laugh.
I completely erased it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't enter the museum.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't want to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom's swimming very fast.
Add this site to Favourites.
I have a lot to say on this.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's what matters to you.
The worst thing is, it wasn't always like that.
All of the doctor's efforts were futile, and the man died soon.
I noticed you weren't at your house last night.
He's threatening us.
You want to buy this sex.
He's a great brain surgeon.
Last month, I was right.
He can speak French as well.
Are you leaving?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They took the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I go now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've been taking days in French for the last three years.
I'm a lot bigger than you.
He only eats fruit.
It wasn't that funny.
Either he or I are wrong.
You're learning French, aren't you?
The girl used to play alone.
He's playing in a group.
The birds were asleep.
Tom's done work at 5:00.
Although Tom left home early today, he's late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was terrible, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
That's how you're doing.
The time will come when she will regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to discover it.
Did they get by the bus to the museum?
Is he your teacher?
Watch out for him.
Be correct.
What else do you want to read?
There's a golden rule: whoever has the gold, he determines the rules.
The house is inhabited by spirits.
Tom's going to town.
Everything that's not forever has become old forever.
You're early again.
Tom got married when he was 30.
I helped Tom make his home.
Can I help you?
You don't always agree with your boss.
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
I don't care.
Did you hear Tom speak French?
A beautiful bay, isn't it?
You really speak French pretty well.
Say hello to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should choose Tom.
Something's going on.
Am I clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not receive basic knowledge of numbers.
I finished philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always give part of the work of younger servants.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do it.
Whatever you're doing, you can't make a man believe in something even less yourself.
I don't feel very well.
The climate doesn't work.
You're sitting in my place.
Don't you think there's anything to scare you?
Everyone agrees with you.
Tom encouraged me to learn French.
I want an MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I'm upset when I think about it.
I paid two hundred dollars of taxes.
I think you should check under the bed.
That won't happen again.
I did it for you.
Stop or I'll let you know.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I saw Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is this?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I have no intention of giving up for a little bit of that watch, and we should not even talk about breaking up with it at last.
He couldn't get the job.
I think you're gonna do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.
Mary made eggs sandwiches.
What did you see?
I drink every morning during the summer.
Put your shirt down.
Read it again.
I wouldn't be so sure of you.
I think you're crazy.
I'm sorry I didn't make it in time for his speech.
I prefer grapefruits in front of the oranges.
This place deserves to visit at least once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just take it.
Her sister stared at her blouse.
I told you that again, didn't I?
Why do you keep repeating that there's too much time?
I'll visit you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like a orange juice.
Since the moment I took your book until I left it, I've been making fun of it all the time, and one day I'm gonna start reading it.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The battle's narrowed down for the round.
That's what I've seen.
Dolphin's kind of a platinum.
What color are these?
He broke his son's shoulder.
Tom heard something and wondered what it could be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be involved.
I'm not taking drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
On Mother's Day, I gave my mother nine flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace can't be maintained with honor, it's supposed to be peace.
She took the room with beautiful furniture.
Job calculators can buy at the price of a pair of socks, and thousands of British children are needed at school, not less than prayer and rubber.
This is the hospital Tom was born in.
You don't have to wait here.
And Tom and Mary covered their eyes.
This is my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop whining.
You can't just go and abuse people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I'll take the money.
She's preparing for college.
I think you're really amazing.
Looks like everything Tom wants is money.
I'm not coming with you.
For the cold time when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.
Tom's running around like a chicken without a head.
Greece is an ancient country.
A few people visited the meeting.
He put his coat on and got out of the house.
Tatobeba's new site will spray the home hyper database of the database, "built by the basics" search engine, and will go to the tattoo-OS server with the tattoo CPU, made entirely of the tattoo.
The old man stopped her.
She hated calling her a coward.
I like it so much.
I've never voted.
Where's the bathroom?
Just go to the room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I totally forgot.
She gave me a nice present.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of the kings.
I have no intention of apologizing to Tom.
What are you doing?
During my vacation, I read all Milton's work.
What are you recommending me?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you're late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Every student was asked a question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I haven't seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't rush to protect me.
Who's Greece's capital?
Tom can't speak French, Mary can't speak French either.
I met her in London for the first time.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Look where you're going.
They described the girl as a little bit.
Tom wasn't used to the city life.
Keep your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're making too much sugar.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
Man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden were inhaled.
They made us work all day.
We chose him as president.
No shit?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I'd have told you.
What's the minimum wage in Luxembourg?
His destiny is predestined.
Are those candles?
If you have to choose between a piano and a brick, what would you choose?
The answer is true.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the test?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
That's good.
That kind of thing is scary.
I think you'd better lie down.
I like you so much.
I called the bell.
The wolves are moving on the dolls.
Do you have medical insurance?
Watch out, Tom!
The museum is closed on Sunday.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't give up.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary.
How hungry are you?
That guy's stable.
I almost didn't win.
That wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I saw you with Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're coming to this in the wrong way.
Something's going on.
Fill it up.
We have a little chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if that's the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it out?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved with regard to what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems young people face.
We finally saw each other. I've been waiting a long time for this moment.
Can you explain a little more detail?
Was it wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary holding his hand.
I think we need to study things.
So we're all in agreement.
If time allows, I'll go to the museum.
That tie is really good for you.
I think you'll be a great father.
There's no way you can contact him.
Never give up, never give up.
Would you show me this bag?
This is my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You won't believe me.
Can you come by nine?
Let's sync the clocks.
I shop every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't.
Is this a harmless store?
I'm looking for a gift for my friend.
And if I'd told you, you know, like hell.
That's the camera Tom took the pictures with.
Look, don't lose yourself.
I hate to change my plans every time you decide you want something else.
It looks like a man far away.
We worked hard to tie both ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I have to rest.
She said she wouldn't move and ink, no matter who told her.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The respondent was given the right to appeal.
Let's not rush it.
My father went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to make a quick exit.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
Wine is the milk of adults.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he enters his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I dream nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you are.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not too late.
I came home with a train.
Why are you always so angry?
Uvi!
That's why you didn't want to come with me?
Did you decide what you wanted to order?
I made the boy sleep deep.
She called it the way she did.
Are we capable of this?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I should have opened my suitcase.
We discussed whether to cancel the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The swimmers were packed from the cold.
It's allowed for dogs.
The kids are the flowers in our lives.
I had to cancel the invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be so stupid.
They hated Tom.
Go ahead.
It's a challenge for me and I'm learning a lot.
Tom was exhausted.
I've been counting on her.
Don't look at Tom.
I have to pay for him.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
This is one of the fish Tom caught.
All right, let's go.
The car's coming.
Looks like we're gonna be able to get there in time.
To be a troll is art.
I ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him in about three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodybuilder.
The man eats bread.
He's crossing the river.
You don't remember, and I'll never forget.
